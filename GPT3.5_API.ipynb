She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6Â°C (101.5Â°F), pulse is 135/minute, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 9,000/mm3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/L. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia.

The surgery under general anesthesia with sevoflurane was uneventful, lasting 98 minutes, during which the patient maintained oxygen saturation readings of 96â€“100% on 8 L of oxygen. She has a history of hypertension, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis of her right knee. Her medications include ramipril, naproxen, ranitidine, and a multivitamin. She appears cyanotic, drowsy, and is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 38.6Â°C (101.5Â°F), pulse is 135/minute, respirations are 36/min, and blood pressure is 155/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 81%. There are several scattered petechiae on the anterior chest wall. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.5 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 9,000/mm3, a platelet count of 145,000/mm3, and a creatine kinase of 190 U/L. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. What is the most likely diagnosis?','answer': 'Fat embolism', 'rationale': 'This patient has shortness of breath after a long bone surgery.  The differential for this patient is pulmonary embolism, fat embolism, myocardial infarction, blood loss, anaphylaxis, or a drug reaction.  The patient has petechiae which makes fat embolism more likely.  This patient most likely has a fat embolism.'}, {'question': 'A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a dry cough and severe chest pain beginning that morning.

His temperature is 38.5Â°C (101.3Â°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows a high-pitched scratching sound best heard while sitting upright and during expiration. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.
