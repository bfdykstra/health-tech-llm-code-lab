Her ECG shows sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities. Her echocardiogram reveals a mildly dilated left ventricle with diffuse hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 34%, severe aortic regurgitation, and a moderate pericardial effusion. Her CT angiography shows an irregular aortic contour with narrowing of the lumen in the vessels of the aortic arch and in the right renal artery, circumferential wall thickening in the aorta at the root and in the ascending segment, and enhancement suggestive of active inflammation. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, and autoimmune vasculitis such as Takayasu arteritis or Giant cell arteritis. Given her recent dental cleaning, infective endocarditis could be a possibility. However, she does not have any evidence of vegetation or aortic-root abscess on her echocardiogram, which makes this less likely. Aortic dissection could also present with her symptoms, but her CT angiography does not show any evidence of dissection.

Her rash could be due to a skin condition, but it could also be a manifestation of her reported porphyria.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), brain tumor, and dementia. Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the findings of multiple acute infarctions in different areas of the brain, a cardioembolic stroke is highly likely. The patient's symptoms of confusion and unsteady gait could also be due to a brain tumor. However, the imaging studies do not show any evidence of a mass or lesion in the brain, making this diagnosis less likely. Dementia could also present with confusion and unsteady gait. However, the acute onset and fluctuating course of the patient's symptoms, along with the findings of acute infarctions on imaging, are not typical for dementia. A TIA could also cause the patient's symptoms. However, TIAs are usually transient and do not cause lasting neurological deficits. The patient's symptoms have been persistent and have even worsened over time, making a TIA less likely. Given the patient's history and the findings on imaging, the most likely diagnosis is recurrent cardioembolic strokes due to atrial fibrillation.\n\nDiagnosis: Recurrent cardioembolic strokes due to atrial fibrillation.""

He lives in a rural area and spends time outdoors, which could expose him to various infectious agents. His differential diagnosis includes a bacterial infection, a viral infection, a fungal infection, or a non-infectious cause such as a flare of his underlying interstitial lung disease.\n\nThe patient's blood cultures and urine cultures showed no growth, making a bacterial infection less likely. His respiratory viral panel, including testing for SARS-CoV-2, was negative, making a viral infection less likely. His blood level of 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan and galactomannan index were within normal limits, making a fungal infection less likely. His CT scan showed resolution of multifocal air-space opacities and new peripheral curvilinear opacity, which could be consistent with a flare of his underlying interstitial lung disease, but this would not typically cause fever and myalgias.\n\nOn hospital day 2, the patient developed pancytopenia and worsening liver function tests. This could be due to a systemic infection, but given the negative cultures and other tests, it could also be due to a non-infectious cause such as an autoimmune or inflammatory condition.

Given his history of kidney transplantation, he is immunosuppressed and at risk for opportunistic infections. His symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and new pulmonary nodules could be due to an infection such as tuberculosis, fungal infection, or a viral infection such as CMV or EBV. His symptoms could also be due to a malignancy such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), which can occur in transplant patients and is often associated with EBV infection. His history of sarcoidosis could also be a factor, as sarcoidosis can recur after transplantation. The presence of miliary nodules on CT scan is suggestive of a hematogenous spread of infection or malignancy. The patient's history of positive EBV IgG and CMV IgG before transplantation raises the possibility of reactivation of these viruses due to immunosuppression. The absence of gastrointestinal symptoms makes CMV less likely.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, compressive optic neuropathy, and infiltrative optic neuropathy. Optic neuritis is often associated with multiple sclerosis and can present with pain and vision loss, but it is usually self-limiting and improves with time, which is not the case in this patient. Ischemic optic neuropathy often presents suddenly and is associated with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, which this patient does not have. Compressive optic neuropathy could be caused by a mass or lesion compressing the optic nerve, but the MRI did not reveal any such abnormalities. Infiltrative optic neuropathy could be caused by an inflammatory or infectious process. Given the patient's history of Lyme disease, this could be a possibility, but the patient was treated for this and her symptoms did not improve. The patient's MRI showed enlargement of the intraorbital right optic nerve, which is consistent with an inflammatory process. The patient's vision loss did not improve with treatment for optic neuritis, suggesting that this is not the correct diagnosis. The patient's positive ANA test suggests an autoimmune process, and the lack of improvement with steroids suggests a more aggressive or atypical form of optic neuritis. The presence of optociliary shunt vessels is a classic sign of optic nerve sheath meningioma, but this is usually a slow-growing tumor and would not typically cause such rapid vision loss. Given the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and lack of response to treatment, the most likely diagnosis is Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. However, the patient's negative test for aquaporin-4 antibodies makes this less likely, as these are typically present in NMOSD. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION), a rare form of recurrent optic neuritis that is steroid-responsive but relapses on steroid withdrawal.\n\nDiagnosis: Chronic Relapsing Inflammatory Optic Neuropathy (CRION)""

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is sacrococcygeal teratoma. This is a type of tumor that is typically benign and is found at the base of the coccyx (tailbone). It is the most common tumor found in newborns. Hypoglycemia can occur in patients with sacrococcygeal teratoma due to the tumor's high metabolic demand.""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes, as well as other conditions that can cause similar symptoms such as Crohn's disease, Behcet's disease, and HIV. \n\nTests for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia were performed. The patient tested positive for treponemal antibodies and his RPR test was reactive at a dilution of 1:1, indicating a current or past syphilis infection. His HIV test was nonreactive, and tests for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were negative. A test for HSV nucleic acids was also performed. \n\nThe patient's symptoms did not improve with treatment, and additional skin lesions appeared. Anoscopy revealed intense rectal and anal inflammation with shallow ulcerations and purulent exudate, consistent with proctitis. \n\nGiven the patient's history and the results of his tests, the most likely diagnosis is a recurrent syphilis infection. The patient's symptoms, including the perianal and penile ulcers, rectal pain, and vesiculopustular rash, are consistent with this diagnosis.

        ""content"": ""Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's recurrent fractures and persistent hypophosphatemia are key indicators of this condition. TIO is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by the development of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia due to the overproduction of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) by mesenchymal tumors. The overproduction of FGF23 leads to renal phosphate wasting and decreased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, resulting in hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia. The patient's normal calcium, parathyroid hormone, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels help rule out other causes of osteomalacia. The patient's normal bone mineral density also suggests a mineralization defect rather than osteoporosis. The presence of an H-shaped sacral insufficiency fracture on imaging is a classic finding in patients with osteomalacia.""

The patient's positive Lyme disease IgM and IgG tests initially suggested Lyme disease, but his symptoms did not improve with appropriate antibiotic treatment, making this diagnosis less likely. The patient's mediastinal mass and lymphadenopathy could suggest lymphoma, but biopsy of the mediastinal mass and lymph nodes did not show any abnormal cell populations or evidence of lymphoma. Sarcoidosis could also present with a mediastinal mass and lymphadenopathy, but the patient's biopsy did not show non-caseating granulomas, which are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Tuberculosis could also present with a mediastinal mass and lymphadenopathy, but the patient's biopsy did not show acid-fast bacilli and cultures were negative for mycobacteria. The patient's history of multiple tick bites, outdoor activities, and initial positive Lyme disease tests suggest a tick-borne illness. The patient's symptoms of fevers, night sweats, and fatigue, along with his mediastinal mass and lymphadenopathy, could be consistent with a disseminated tick-borne illness such as babesiosis or anaplasmosis, but his blood tests for anaplasma and babesia nucleic acids were negative.

His negative tests for Lyme disease antibodies are not definitive, as serologic tests can be negative in the early stages of the disease.

She had contact with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection six weeks prior to admission, but did not show symptoms at that time. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes COVID-19, influenza, other respiratory viruses, bacterial pneumonia, and possibly a non-infectious cause such as a vasculitis or autoimmune disease. However, the patient's symptoms started six days prior to admission, which is within the typical incubation period for COVID-19. Furthermore, her symptoms of fever, myalgias, diarrhea, and dry cough are all common in COVID-19. However, the patient tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 twice, which makes COVID-19 less likely, although false negatives are possible. The patient also tested negative for other common respiratory viruses and bacteria. The patient's chest CT showed interlobular septal thickening, mild ground-glass opacities at the lung bases, and small bilateral pleural effusions, which can be seen in COVID-19, but also in other conditions such as heart failure, other viral pneumonias, and interstitial lung diseases. The patient's procalcitonin level was elevated, which is more commonly seen in bacterial infections, but can also be elevated in severe viral infections. Given the patient's history of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case, her symptoms, and the imaging findings, COVID-19 is still a possibility despite the negative tests. However, given the negative tests and the elevated procalcitonin, a bacterial infection cannot be ruled out. \n\nDiagnosis: \nThe diagnosis is unclear based on the provided information.

The elevated urinary porphyrin levels are indicative of a porphyria, a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the nervous system and skin. The patient's symptoms, particularly the abdominal pain, constipation, and mental changes, are consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, one of the types of porphyria that primarily affects the nervous system. The patient's recent change in diet to a ketogenic diet could have triggered an attack, as fasting and dieting are known triggers for acute intermittent porphyria. The patient's response to treatment with hemin, which is used to treat acute attacks of porphyria, further supports this diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Acute intermittent porphyria.""

She has had worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and poor oral intake. She has also had difficulty with word finding and has expressed suicidal ideation. She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She has had a significant weight loss of 18 kg over the past 4 months while following a limited diet. She has also reported memory difficulties for the past 2 months. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes gastrointestinal obstruction, malignancy, malnutrition, and porphyria. The patient's CT scan showed evidence of a previous cholecystectomy, the common bile duct measured 7 mm in diameter, and there was mild anasarca with diffuse mesenteric edema. This could suggest a gastrointestinal obstruction. However, the patient's worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and poor oral intake could also suggest a malignancy. The patient's significant weight loss and limited diet could suggest malnutrition. Finally, the patient's memory difficulties and suicidal ideation could suggest a neurological or psychiatric condition such as porphyria.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results showed normocytic anemia and an elevated bilirubin level. Her urine specimens showed elevated urinary porphyrin levels. This is suggestive of porphyria. Porphyria is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the nervous system and skin.

Given the patient's age, history of smoking, and family history of various cancers, malignancies should be considered. However, the patient's symptoms are not specific to any particular type of cancer and there is no evidence of a mass or lymphadenopathy on examination. Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis could also present with similar symptoms, but the patient does not have any known history of autoimmune disease and the presentation is somewhat atypical. Infectious diseases are also a possibility, particularly given the patient's recent travel to the Southwest. Conditions such as coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) or histoplasmosis could present with similar symptoms. The patient's symptoms have not improved with antibiotics, suggesting that a bacterial infection is less likely. The patient's skin and muscle biopsy results are suggestive of an inflammatory process, which could be consistent with an infectious or autoimmune etiology. The patient's imaging findings of patchy opacities in the lungs could be consistent with an infectious process such as pneumonia, or possibly a malignancy.

He has a history of similar symptoms six years prior, which were associated with a left medial cerebellar infarct and a small left lateral medullary infarct. His current symptoms are not relieved with ibuprofen or marijuana. His medical history is notable for dyslipidemia and he has a family history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He smokes cigars and marijuana occasionally, and drinks up to eight beers per day on weekends. His current examination reveals a mild decrease in coordination in the left hand but is otherwise normal. CT angiography of the head and neck reveals dissection of the left vertebral artery, extending from the origin of the artery to the proximal V3 (upper cervical) segment, with a 2-mm pseudoaneurysm at the C2-C3 level. MRI of the head shows a focus of intrinsic hyperintensity along the left vertebral artery, consistent with hemorrhage within the vessel wall from the dissection. CT of the abdomen and pelvis reveals dissection of the right renal artery, extending from the origin of the artery to subsegmental renal arteries, suggestive of infarction. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, and connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Given the patient's history of arterial dissections and infarctions, fibromuscular dysplasia is a strong possibility. However, this condition is more common in women and typically presents with hypertension, which this patient does not have. Vasculitis could also cause the patient's symptoms, but he does not have other systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or malaise. Connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome could also cause arterial dissections, but these conditions typically present with other systemic features such as joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, or ocular abnormalities, which this patient does not have. \n\nGiven the patient's history of multiple arterial dissections and infarctions, the most likely diagnosis is a genetic disorder of connective tissue that predisposes to arterial dissections. The most common of these is vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), which is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene. This condition is characterized by arterial, intestinal, and/or uterine fragility.

He also has elevated liver enzymes, ferritin, D-dimer, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes sepsis, autoimmune disease, malignancy, and Kawasaki disease. The patient's blood cultures and urinalysis are normal, making sepsis less likely. The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and elevated inflammatory markers could be consistent with an autoimmune disease, but the patient does not have any other symptoms such as joint pain or organ-specific symptoms that would suggest a specific autoimmune disease. Malignancy could present with fever and elevated inflammatory markers, but the patient does not have any symptoms such as weight loss, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy that would suggest malignancy. Kawasaki disease could present with fever and rash, but the patient does not have the other classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease such as conjunctivitis, changes in the lips or oral cavity, changes in the extremities, or cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and elevated inflammatory markers, along with his history of Hirschsprung's disease, suggest the possibility of an autoinflammatory disease. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), a severe form of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). NOMID is characterized by fever, rash, and elevated inflammatory markers, and can also cause joint symptoms, as seen in this patient. The patient's history of Hirschsprung's disease could also be related to his underlying autoinflammatory disease, as some studies have suggested a possible association between Hirschsprung's disease and autoinflammatory diseases.\n\nDiagnosis: Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID).""

However, these diseases would not typically cause splenomegaly. Finally, the patient's pancytopenia could be drug-induced. However, the patient's medications do not typically cause pancytopenia. Given the patient's symptoms, exposure history, and the lack of a clear alternative diagnosis, a tick-borne disease seems most likely.\n\nDiagnosis: Tick-borne disease, such as anaplasmosis or babesiosis.""

However, her hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel was negative. The patient's chest CT scans show bilateral mosaic attenuation and multiple bilateral lung nodules, which are characteristic of a rare lung disease called pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH). This condition is often seen in smokers, but can also occur in non-smokers. The patient's history of eczema, a condition that involves overactive immune cells, could potentially predispose her to PLCH, which is caused by an overproduction of immune cells in the lungs. \n\nDiagnosis: Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH)""

The patient's symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, along with his neurological signs of agitation, somnolence, and pain with head movement, are suggestive of meningitis or encephalitis. His CSF analysis shows lymphocytic predominance, which is more suggestive of viral meningitis or encephalitis than bacterial. However, his imaging shows multiple small hyperintense foci in the caudate nuclei and putamina, as well as scattered hyperintense foci in the subcortical and periventricular white matter of the frontal lobes and the anterior corona radiata. These findings are not typical for viral meningitis or encephalitis, but have been reported in patients with COVID-19.

She was found unresponsive in her car and has remained obtunded. She has a history of suspicious and paranoid beliefs, confusion, and difficulty with basic diabetes management. Her MMSE score was 24, indicating cognitive impairment. Her blood glucose level was elevated, and urinalysis revealed the presence of protein, glucose, and ketones. CT and MRI of the head revealed increased attenuation in the basal ganglia, thalami, and dentate nuclei. CSF analysis showed rare neutrophils with no organisms and rare atypical cells. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, stroke, encephalitis, meningitis, and a paraneoplastic syndrome. Diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia can be ruled out because the patient's blood glucose level was elevated but not to the extent typically seen in diabetic ketoacidosis, and there were no hypoglycemic episodes in the preceding week. Stroke is less likely given the symmetric findings on imaging and the absence of focal neurologic deficits. Encephalitis and meningitis are also less likely given the negative CSF cultures and the absence of organisms on Gram stain. \n\nThe patient's history of cancer, the presence of atypical cells in the CSF, and the cognitive and neurologic symptoms suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome. Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare disorders triggered by an altered immune system response to a neoplasm. They are defined by clinical manifestations of organ or tissue damage away from the tumor site. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast cancer, along with her neurologic symptoms and the presence of atypical cells in the CSF, support this diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Paraneoplastic syndrome.""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes myocardial infarction, electrolyte imbalance, drug overdose, and hypoxia. The patient's ECG showed a wide QRS complex and multifocal premature ventricular contractions, which could be indicative of myocardial infarction. However, coronary angiography revealed only minimal luminal irregularities, making myocardial infarction less likely. The patient's history of heroin use disorder raises the possibility of drug overdose, but he had reportedly been abstinent from opiates for the previous 3 years. The patient's blood potassium level was notably low at 2.0 mmol per liter, indicating a severe electrolyte imbalance. This could potentially cause ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. The patient's diet was reported to be poor, consisting primarily of several packages of candy daily. This could contribute to the electrolyte imbalance. The patient's blood oxygen saturation was 85%, which is lower than normal but not low enough to cause hypoxia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is severe hypokalemia caused by poor diet.\n\nDiagnosis: Severe hypokalemia.""

Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus was negative. Posteroanterior and lateral radiography of the chest revealed a 4-cm rounded mass in the right lower lobe. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed a rounded mass in the right lower lobe with ground-glass attenuation and a rim of higher attenuation at the periphery of the mass, findings that represent the reversed halo sign. In addition, there were smaller ground-glass nodules at the periphery of the right middle lobe and left upper lobe, with associated right hilar lymphadenopathy. These findings are most consistent with viral pneumonia, although primary cancer of the lung cannot be ruled out.

She was admitted to the hospital due to confusion and hypoxemia. She had nasal congestion six days prior to admission and was found to be confused and incontinent of urine and stool by her son. She reported chills but no fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, chest pain, or dysuria. She lived in an assisted-living facility where multiple residents had recently been diagnosed with Covid-19. Her temperature was elevated, and she appeared ill and lethargic. She was alert and oriented but unable to recall events from earlier in the day. Her lungs were clear on auscultation. The white-cell count was within normal range, but the blood D-dimer level was elevated. Urinalysis results were normal. Nucleic acid testing of a nasopharyngeal swab was negative for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus but was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Chest radiography showed patchy airspace opacities in the left upper lobe and surrounding the hilum. CT pulmonary angiography of the chest showed multifocal consolidative and ground-glass opacities in both lungs, which are commonly reported with Covid-19 pneumonia. There was no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The patient's condition worsened over the next few days, and she died on the fourth hospital day.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes Covid-19, influenza, and other respiratory infections. However, the patient's symptoms, the recent outbreak of Covid-19 in her assisted-living facility, and the positive test for SARS-CoV-2 strongly suggest that she has Covid-19. The ground-glass opacities seen on the CT scan are also characteristic of Covid-19. The patient's confusion could be due to hypoxemia caused by the disease. The elevated D-dimer level could indicate a coagulation abnormality, which has been associated with severe Covid-19. The patient's other comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, could have made her more susceptible to severe disease.\n\nDiagnosis: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, or Covid-19.""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes metastatic melanoma, infectious pneumonia, and drug-induced pneumonitis. The patient has a history of malignant melanoma, which increases the likelihood of metastatic disease. However, the patient has been on pembrolizumab therapy for 3 years, which can cause drug-induced pneumonitis. The patient also recently traveled to the northern coast of South America, which could expose her to infectious agents causing pneumonia. However, the patient is asymptomatic, which makes infectious pneumonia less likely. The patient's imaging shows a patchy consolidation in the left upper lobe, bilateral hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and numerous bilateral scattered solid pulmonary nodules with associated ground-glass halos. These findings are new compared to imaging from 3 months ago. This rapid progression of disease is more consistent with drug-induced pneumonitis than metastatic melanoma, which would likely show a more gradual progression. Furthermore, the patient's other pulmonary nodules have been stable for the past 3 years, which also suggests that the new findings are not due to metastatic disease. \n\nDiagnosis: Drug-induced pneumonitis due to pembrolizumab therapy.""

His symptoms and the fact that he was camping in a forest and had a tick on his head make tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, babesiosis, and anaplasmosis possible. However, his symptoms are severe, and he has ground-glass opacities in both lungs, which are not typical for these diseases. His mouse bite and the fact that he was in a forest make hantavirus pulmonary syndrome a possibility. This disease is caused by a virus that is carried by rodents, and it can cause severe respiratory symptoms and a low platelet count, which the patient has. His symptoms started after his camping trip and his mouse bite, which fits with the incubation period of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Therefore, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.""

The patient does not have symptoms of type 1 diabetes such as weight loss, fatigue, or diabetic ketoacidosis. Furthermore, type 1 diabetes is less likely given her age and the fact that she was able to manage her blood glucose levels with lifestyle modifications and metformin for a period of time. MODY is a form of diabetes that is often misdiagnosed as type 1 or type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by onset at a young age (often before 25 years of age), a strong family history of diabetes, and the absence of obesity. This patient's history is consistent with MODY. She had hyperglycemia at a young age, a strong family history of diabetes, and she is not obese. Furthermore, the fact that she required insulin during her pregnancies and had episodes of hypoglycemia suggests that she has a form of diabetes that involves a defect in insulin secretion, which is characteristic of MODY.\n\nDiagnosis: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)""

His symptoms did not improve with antibiotics, and he later developed worsening cough, fever, early satiety, nausea, nonbloody diarrhea, orthopnea, edema in the legs, abdominal distention, decreased urine output, and weight gain. His creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels were elevated. His urinalysis revealed blood and protein, and microscopic examination of the sediment revealed red cells, including acanthocytes. His chest radiography revealed faint air-space opacities in the left lower lobe and left perihilar region, and CT of the chest showed centrilobular nodules and patchy opacities in both lung bases, as well as mediastinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy. His test for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) was positive, with a perinuclear staining pattern, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the presence of myeloperoxidase ANCA at a high titer. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome. Goodpasture syndrome is less likely because the patient's antibodies to the Goodpasture antigen were not detected. Wegener's granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome are all forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis, which can cause rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and lung involvement. However, Wegener's granulomatosis is typically associated with c-ANCA and PR3-ANCA, not p-ANCA and MPO-ANCA, which were found in this patient. Churg-Strauss syndrome is less likely because the patient does not have a history of asthma or eosinophilia. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is microscopic polyangiitis, which is associated with p-ANCA and MPO-ANCA and can cause rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and lung involvement.\n\nDiagnosis: Microscopic polyangiitis.""

The patient's markedly tanned skin, most notable on light-exposed areas, is a key clue and is suggestive of increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which can occur in Addison's disease, a condition characterized by adrenal insufficiency. This condition can cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, as well as fatigue and weakness due to inadequate production of cortisol.

His lab results show elevated liver enzymes and ferritin levels, but negative tests for hepatitis and HIV. He also has negative tests for Lyme disease, babesia, ehrlichia, anaplasma, adenovirus, and cytomegalovirus. His bone marrow biopsy shows evidence of hemophagocytosis, but no evidence of infection or lymphoma. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and lymphoma. The patient's negative tests for various infections and lack of lymphadenopathy make lymphoma less likely. SLE can cause pancytopenia and rash, but it typically does not cause hemophagocytosis. HLH is a condition characterized by overactivation of the immune system, leading to severe inflammation and organ damage. It can cause the symptoms seen in this patient, including fever, rash, pancytopenia, and hemophagocytosis. Therefore, HLH is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)""

The differential diagnosis includes gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), food allergies, pyloric stenosis, and rumination syndrome. GERD is less likely because the patient's symptoms did not improve with omeprazole treatment. Food allergies are also less likely because the patient's IgE antibodies to cow's milk were normal and his symptoms did not improve with hypoallergenic or elemental formulas. Pyloric stenosis is less likely because the patient's vomiting is not consistently projectile and the condition typically presents earlier in infancy. Rumination syndrome is a behavioral disorder characterized by the voluntary or involuntary regurgitation and rechewing of food, which is then either spit out or reswallowed. This condition is more likely because the patient's vomiting often occurs immediately after meals and contains undigested food, and the patient often requests more food after vomiting. \n\nDiagnosis: Rumination syndrome.""

The differential diagnosis includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. However, her alpha-1 antitrypsin test was negative, ruling out alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Her CT scan did not show bronchiectasis, making this diagnosis less likely. Cystic fibrosis typically presents with recurrent respiratory infections and malabsorption, but this patient does not have gastrointestinal symptoms, making cystic fibrosis less likely. Her pulmonary function tests show severe obstruction and hyperinflation, which are characteristic of COPD. However, COPD is typically caused by long-term exposure to lung irritants, such as smoking, and this patient does not have a history of smoking or other environmental exposures. Her history of congenital lobar emphysema, recurrent respiratory illnesses, and the CT findings of severe confluent emphysema and multiple apical bullae suggest a diagnosis of primary ciliary dyskinesia.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pneumonia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's symptoms of cough, fever, and dyspnea could suggest pneumonia, but the patient's chest radiograph does not show the typical lobar consolidation seen in pneumonia. The patient's elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level could suggest congestive heart failure, but the patient does not have symptoms of fluid overload such as edema or jugular venous distention. The patient's elevated d-dimer level could suggest a pulmonary embolism, but the patient does not have risk factors for a pulmonary embolism such as recent surgery or immobilization. The patient's severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and the absence of heart failure suggest ARDS. The patient's condition worsened despite supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation, which is consistent with ARDS. The patient's bronchoscopy revealed pink frothy secretions, which is also consistent with ARDS. \n\nDiagnosis: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)""

The patient's joint pain and rash could be indicative of rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, but his lack of other symptoms such as photosensitivity, dry eyes or mouth, and Raynaud's phenomenon make these diagnoses less likely. His history of malaria and immigration from sub-Saharan Africa could suggest tuberculosis, but his negative purified protein derivative test and lack of night sweats or chills make this less likely. His history of heavy beer drinking and smoking could suggest a malignancy, but his negative cytologic examination of the pericardial fluid for malignant cells makes this less likely. His unintentional weight loss, fatigue, and anorexia could suggest HIV, but his negative screening tests for HIV types 1 and 2 and HIV p24 antigen make this less likely.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hematoma, infection, thrombosis, and malignancy.

The patient's history of ICD placement and the location of the mass suggest the possibility of an infection or thrombosis related to the device.

His symptoms have worsened over the past 30 months, with the addition of fatigue, malaise, sore throat, rhinorrhea, and arthralgias. His chest radiograph shows subcentimeter, faint nodular opacities in the upper lung zones. His CT scan reveals diffuse subpleural reticulation, without honeycombing or traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis. He has a few bilateral, scattered, solid pulmonary nodules, measuring 3 to 6 mm in diameter. There is mild enlargement of a low right paratracheal lymph node and of a right hilar lymph node, and aortic and coronary atherosclerosis is present. His pulmonary function tests reveal a restrictive ventilatory deficit with diffusion impairment. His symptoms, imaging findings, and pulmonary function tests are consistent with a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease. The differential diagnosis includes hypersensitivity pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonia, and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia. Given the patient's history of smoking, the presence of nodules on imaging, and the absence of a history of exposure to known causes of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, usual interstitial pneumonia (also known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Usual interstitial pneumonia (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes recurrent major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, cardiac arrhythmias, and side effects of medications. The patient's symptoms of palpitations and near syncope, as well as his history of atrial fibrillation, suggest a cardiac etiology. However, his psychiatric symptoms, including depression and anxiety, could also be contributing to his presentation. His medications, including citalopram and clonazepam, could potentially cause side effects such as fatigue and palpitations. However, the patient's symptoms improved with the initiation of aripiprazole, suggesting that his psychiatric symptoms were a major contributor to his presentation. His symptoms of a racing and \""thumping\"" heart, excessive worry, and difficulty breathing are characteristic of panic disorder.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Behcet's disease, lupus, and other autoimmune diseases, as well as infectious diseases such as syphilis or HIV. The patient's negative tests for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide make lupus and other autoimmune diseases less likely.

The patient's positive test for HLA-B51, along with her history of oral and nasal aphthous ulcerations, eye inflammation, and skin lesions, make Behcet's disease a likely diagnosis. However, the patient's presentation is atypical for Behcet's disease, as she does not have genital ulcers or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient's decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts could be due to her treatment with rituximab, which depletes B cells and can indirectly affect T cell counts. However, these decreased counts could also suggest an underlying immunodeficiency. The patient's history of spontaneous pneumothoraxes in her 20s could suggest a connective tissue disorder, but her negative tests for antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor make this less likely.

The patient's history of CLL and the recent increase in lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms such as fever and night sweats suggest disease progression or transformation. Richter's transformation, which is a transformation of CLL into a more aggressive lymphoma, often presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes, B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss), and elevated LDH, which fits this patient's presentation. However, the patient's history of hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections also raises the possibility of an infectious process. Lymphoma could also present with lymphadenopathy and B symptoms, but the patient's long history of CLL makes this less likely. The biopsy of the lymph node showed a dense monomorphic infiltrate of small mature lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm, which is consistent with CLL, and there was no evidence of large-cell transformation, making Richter's transformation less likely.

However, the patient's neurological examination was normal, and her symptoms did not improve with time, making a transient ischemic attack unlikely. Peripheral neuropathy typically presents with a more chronic course and would not explain her psychiatric symptoms. Her laboratory results did not indicate a metabolic disorder. The patient's disorganized thinking, delusions of persecution, and cognitive impairment are suggestive of a psychiatric condition. Given her age, the sudden onset of her symptoms, and the absence of a previous psychiatric history, a diagnosis of late-onset schizophrenia is less likely. The patient's pressured speech, tangential thought processes, and happy mood could suggest a manic episode of bipolar disorder, but she did not report previous depressive or manic episodes. The patient's cognitive impairment, disorganized thinking, and delusions of persecution are most consistent with a delirium. Delirium can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, metabolic disorders, and drug intoxication or withdrawal.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes infectious causes such as bacterial gastroenteritis, viral gastroenteritis, or parasitic infection; inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; and ischemic colitis. The patient's recent travel history raises the possibility of a travel-related infection. However, the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for 20 days, which is a relatively long duration for a typical case of gastroenteritis. The patient's abdominal pain and hematochezia could be consistent with inflammatory bowel disease, but he does not have a family history of this condition. Ischemic colitis is unlikely given the patient's young age and lack of risk factors. The patient's blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae and gram-positive cocci, indicating a bacterial infection. The presence of two types of bacteria suggests a polymicrobial infection, which is more common in intra-abdominal infections. The patient's symptoms and the results of his blood cultures suggest an intra-abdominal infection such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. However, the patient's CT scan did not show evidence of an acute process in the abdomen or pelvis, and the appendix was not visible. This makes appendicitis or diverticulitis less likely. The patient's symptoms, the results of his blood cultures, and the lack of findings on his CT scan suggest a diagnosis of infectious colitis.\n\nDiagnosis: Infectious colitis.""

She has been having recurrent sinus infections and has been treated with multiple courses of antibiotics. She has also developed a persistent cough and has been producing yellowish-white sputum. Her chest radiography showed bronchiectasis, predominantly in the upper and middle lung zones. A sputum culture grew Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Mycobacterium abscessus. Her pulmonary function tests showed a reduced FEV1 and FVC, but a normal total lung capacity. Her symptoms, along with her history and test results, suggest a few possible diagnoses. These include cystic fibrosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, leading to lung infections and damage. However, the patient's age and lack of digestive symptoms make this diagnosis less likely. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a genetic disorder that affects the movement of cilia in the lungs, leading to recurrent respiratory infections. However, this condition is usually diagnosed in childhood, making it less likely in this case. Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a condition where the bronchi in the lungs are permanently damaged and widened. This can be caused by recurrent lung infections, immune system disorders, or inhaling a foreign object or harmful substance.

        ""content"": ""The patient is a 58-year-old woman presenting with hypoesthesia, paresthesia, and weakness. She has a history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, and symptomatic spinal stenosis. Her symptoms began with back pain, followed by numbness in a bandlike distribution around her trunk, weakness in her arms, abdominal distention, and urinary incontinence. She also reported paresthesia in her fingers. Her symptoms have been progressing over the course of several weeks. She lives in a wooded area in northeastern Connecticut. She also reported a nonpruritic, nonpainful erythema on her left gluteal fold that she thought was an insect bite. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, Lyme disease, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Multiple sclerosis and transverse myelitis can present with similar symptoms, but the patient's history of an insect bite and living in a wooded area in northeastern Connecticut, a region endemic for Lyme disease, makes Lyme disease a strong possibility. Guillain-Barre syndrome is less likely given the chronicity of her symptoms. Lyme disease can cause neurologic symptoms, including numbness and weakness, and can also cause a characteristic erythema migrans rash, which the patient may have had. The patient's symptoms and history are most consistent with Lyme disease.\n\nDiagnosis: Lyme disease.""

He also has a history of exposure to farm animals and birds. His symptoms started with malaise and anorexia, followed by a nonproductive cough and fevers. Despite multiple courses of antibiotics, his symptoms persisted and he developed neurological symptoms. His lab results showed an elevated white blood cell count and troponin level. Imaging showed multiple infarcts in the brain, lungs, spleen, and kidneys. His symptoms and imaging findings suggest a systemic disease causing multiple infarcts. The differential diagnosis includes infective endocarditis, vasculitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Given his history of exposure to farm animals and birds, zoonotic infections such as Q fever or psittacosis could also be considered. However, his lab results were negative for these infections. His positive antineutrophil antibody test suggests an autoimmune process, but his negative antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test makes vasculitis less likely. His history of heavy alcohol use could contribute to DIC, but his normal activated partial-thromboplastin time makes this less likely. His history of smoking and heavy alcohol use, along with his elevated troponin level, suggest possible cardiovascular disease, which could cause emboli leading to multiple infarcts. However, his echocardiogram did not show any evidence of a patent foramen ovale or vegetations on the heart valves, making this less likely. Given his history of exposure to farm animals and birds, his persistent fevers despite antibiotics, and his multiple infarcts, the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis.

He also has mild swelling of the face and hands, with blisters on the palms. His symptoms started about 3 weeks prior to admission and he initially thought he had influenza. His symptoms have persisted and he has been treated with an unknown antibiotic and prednisone. His medical history includes hyperlipidemia, depression, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He has a history of smoking and marijuana use. He has not traveled outside of New England and has no known exposures to animals or insects. He has had multiple female sexual contacts but has always used barrier protection. His family history is notable for lung cancer in his mother and diabetes and coronary artery disease in his father; there is no history of autoimmune or dermatologic disorders. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes an infectious process, an autoimmune process, or a drug reaction. Given the patient's history of smoking and marijuana use, a lung infection could be possible. However, his CT scan of the chest only revealed areas of centrilobular emphysema and bronchial-wall thickening, scattered pulmonary nodules in the upper lobes, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes. There was no evidence of pneumonia or other lung infection. His blood cultures were also negative, making a systemic bacterial infection less likely. \n\nAn autoimmune process could also be possible given his symptoms of fever, rash, and myalgias. However, his flow cytometry was negative for a monotypic B-cell population and for T cells with immunophenotypic abnormalities. This makes an autoimmune process less likely. \n\nThe patient also reported starting a new over-the-counter medication for pain approximately 5 weeks before admission. He stopped taking it at the onset of his presenting symptoms. This timeline fits with a possible drug reaction. His symptoms of fever, rash, and myalgias could be consistent with a drug reaction. His lab results also showed an elevated eosinophil count, which can be seen in drug reactions. \n\nGiven the patient's history and lab results, a drug reaction seems to be the most likely diagnosis. \n\nDiagnosis: Drug reaction.""

The patient's EKG showed sinus rhythm, borderline first-degree atrioventricular block, left atrial abnormality, and anterolateral J-point elevation but no ST-segment changes, which makes myocardial infarction less likely. The CT of the head did not show any evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or intracranial mass lesion, which makes TIA or stroke less likely. The patient did not show any signs of alcohol withdrawal. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed two masses with heterogeneous echotexture, measuring up to 3.8 cm in diameter, each with an echo-bright (bright white) circumference. The masses were located at the right atrioventricular groove and were compressing the tricuspid annulus at the juncture of the right atrium and the right ventricle, resulting in turbulent transtricuspid flow on color Doppler imaging.

The presence of red cells, red-cell casts, and white-cell casts in the urinary sediment further supports this. The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and prostate cancer, along with his smoking and alcohol habits, put him at risk for kidney disease. The patient's symptoms did not improve with hydration, suggesting that the kidney issue is not simply due to dehydration. The presence of gram-negative rods in the blood cultures suggests a bacterial infection, which could have spread to the kidneys, causing an infection there. The CT scan revealed bilateral renal cysts, which could be the source of the infection. The patient's symptoms and lab findings did not improve with antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the kidney issue is not solely due to a bacterial infection. The patient's history of prostate cancer raises the possibility of cancer spreading to the kidneys, but this is less likely given the lack of other symptoms of cancer, such as weight loss. The patient's symptoms and lab findings are most consistent with glomerulonephritis, an inflammation of the glomeruli in the kidneys. This can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and certain medications. The patient's history of prostate cancer and use of certain medications, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, could have contributed to the development of glomerulonephritis.\n\nDiagnosis: Glomerulonephritis.""

His symptoms began with a subjective fever, chills, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, and myalgias, which were temporarily relieved with acetaminophen. He also reported reduced fluid intake and darkening of his urine. His creatinine level was found to be significantly elevated compared to two months prior. He was admitted to the hospital and his outpatient medications were adjusted. His creatinine level initially decreased, but then increased again and he developed hematuria. He was started on methylprednisolone and a plan was made for a kidney biopsy. However, he developed a fever and leukocytosis, and blood cultures grew gram-negative rods. He was started on antibiotics and transferred to this hospital. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes acute interstitial nephritis, glomerulonephritis, and infection-related glomerulonephritis. Acute interstitial nephritis is often drug-induced and can present with fever, rash, and eosinophilia, but this patient's presentation is not typical and he does not have eosinophilia. Glomerulonephritis can present with hematuria and renal failure, but it is usually associated with hypertension, edema, and proteinuria, which this patient does not have. Infection-related glomerulonephritis can occur after a bacterial infection and can present with hematuria, hypertension, edema, and renal failure. This patient does have a bacterial infection and hematuria, but he does not have hypertension or edema. \n\nGiven the patient's presentation and the fact that his symptoms began after his wife had influenza-like symptoms, it is possible that he has an infection-related glomerulonephritis. His renal failure and hematuria could be due to glomerular damage caused by an immune response to the infection. The presence of gram-negative rods in his blood cultures suggests a bacterial infection, which could have triggered the immune response. \n\nDiagnosis: Infection-related glomerulonephritis.""

She also has a family history of venous thromboses, miscarriages, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Her symptoms have been ongoing for 18 months, with recent worsening including leg swelling, abdominal distention, weight gain, and episodes of confusion and chest pain. She has been found to have biventricular hypertrophy, systolic anterior motion of the mitral-valve leaflets, and accelerated flow in the left ventricular outflow tract on echocardiogram. Her blood pressure has been persistently elevated despite medication. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, pheochromocytoma, Cushing's syndrome, and hyperaldosteronism. The patient's family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and her echocardiogram findings make this a strong possibility. However, her persistent hypertension despite medication, hypokalemia, and recent weight gain also suggest a possible endocrine cause. Pheochromocytoma could cause hypertension and tachycardia, but this is less likely given the patient's normal plasma free catecholamines and metanephrines. Hyperaldosteronism could cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but the patient's normal aldosterone level makes this less likely. Cushing's syndrome could cause hypertension, weight gain, and hypokalemia, and could also explain the patient's recent confusion and increased hair growth. \n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and lab findings, the most likely diagnosis is Cushing's syndrome. This is supported by the patient's persistent hypertension, hypokalemia, weight gain, confusion, and increased hair growth. The diffuse thickening of both adrenal glands seen on CT angiography also supports this diagnosis. \n\nDiagnosis: Cushing's syndrome.""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hydrocele, epididymo-orchitis, testicular torsion, and testicular cancer. The patient's initial presentation was suggestive of a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac around a testicle that causes swelling in the scrotum. However, the patient's symptoms did not improve with conservative management, making this diagnosis less likely. Epididymo-orchitis, an inflammation of the testicle and epididymis, was also considered, but the patient did not have any symptoms of infection such as fever or pain, and his condition did not improve with antibiotics. Testicular torsion, a twisting of the spermatic cord that cuts off the blood supply to the testicle, is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of acute pain. The patient's age, the painless nature of the swelling, and the continued growth of the mass despite treatment are all suggestive of testicular cancer. The ultrasound findings of an enlarged testicle with multiple hypoechoic areas also support this diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Testicular cancer.""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, parotid gland tumor, and other opportunistic infections such as fungal or mycobacterial infections. The patient's history of HIV infection and low CD4+ T-cell count make him susceptible to opportunistic infections and malignancies.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, SLE, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and Behcet's disease. \n\nCNS vasculitis was previously suspected due to the patient's history of headaches and abnormal MRI findings. However, the patient's symptoms improved temporarily with immunosuppressive therapy and repeat MRI reportedly showed resolution of the hyperintensity. This makes CNS vasculitis less likely. \n\nSLE is a possibility given the patient's positive antinuclear antibodies, anti-Ro antibodies, and hypocomplementemia. However, the patient's symptoms did not improve with immunosuppressive therapy typically used for SLE, making this diagnosis less likely. \n\nIIH, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure, which can cause headaches and vision loss. The patient's symptoms of transient vision loss, headaches, and pulsatile tinnitus, as well as the finding of bilateral optic disk swelling, are suggestive of IIH. However, the patient's CSF analysis did not show elevated protein or cell count, which would be expected in IIH. \n\nBehcet's disease is a rare disorder characterized by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including mucocutaneous lesions, headaches, and vision problems. The patient's recurrent painful mucocutaneous lesions of the hands, feet, and mouth, as well as her headaches and vision loss, are consistent with Behcet's disease. \n\nDiagnosis:\nThe most likely diagnosis is Behcet's disease.""

The patient's recent activity of cleaning out a basement where he had seen mice could have increased his exposure to mosquitoes. The nerve conduction studies showing severely reduced amplitude and the electromyography revealing abundant fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in multiple muscles are consistent with a severe neurologic disease, such as EEE. The absence of voluntary motor units in the left arm or leg suggests a severe, potentially irreversible, neurologic damage. The patient's lack of response to broad-spectrum antibiotics and antiviral medications further supports the diagnosis of a viral infection not covered by these treatments, such as EEE.""

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes malignancy, autoimmune disease, infectious disease, and neurodegenerative disease. The patient's age and weight loss could suggest malignancy, but imaging studies did not reveal any suspicious lesions. The patient's symptoms of fever and altered mental status could suggest an infectious disease. The patient's history of cleaning out a basement where he had seen mice suggests possible exposure to hantavirus or other rodent-borne diseases. However, the patient's neurological symptoms, including confusion, difficulties with word finding, and inability to consistently follow commands, as well as the findings on MRI and nerve-conduction studies, suggest a neurological disease. The MRI findings of scattered foci of signal abnormalities in the supratentorial white matter and mild hyperintensity in the medial thalami and medial temporal lobes could suggest a neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease or a prion disease such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, the rapid progression of symptoms and the findings on nerve-conduction studies of severely reduced amplitude of the motor responses of the bilateral median nerves and no voluntary motor units in the left arm or leg suggest a more acute neurological disease such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or a variant thereof. The patient's history of recent exposure to mice could suggest a variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome known as Miller Fisher syndrome, which can be triggered by infection with Campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium that can be carried by rodents. However, the patient's symptoms of fever and altered mental status, as well as the findings on lumbar puncture, suggest a central nervous system infection rather than a peripheral nervous system disease such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when she developed a fever, fatigue, and a rash on her trunk and extremities. She also reported a 5-pound weight loss over the past month. She had no history of recent travel, sick contacts, or changes in her diet. She had no known drug allergies and was not taking any medications. She had a history of hypertension, for which she was not taking medication. She had no history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. She had no family history of autoimmune diseases or malignancies. On physical examination, the patient appeared ill. Her temperature was 38.7\u00b0C, blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, pulse rate was 110 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute. She had a diffuse, maculopapular rash on her trunk and extremities. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a white-cell count of 11,000 per cubic millimeter, with 70% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, and 10% monocytes. The hemoglobin level was 10.5 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 150,000 per cubic millimeter. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 50 mm per hour, and the C-reactive protein level was 3.0 mg per deciliter. The serum creatinine level was 1.0 mg per deciliter, and the alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were within normal limits. The serum albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter. Tests for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. A chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. A skin biopsy was performed.\n\nRationale:\nThe patient presents with fever, fatigue, rash, and weight loss. The differential diagnosis includes infection, malignancy, and autoimmune disease. Given the patient's age, malignancy such as lymphoma should be considered. However, the lack of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly makes this less likely. Infection is also a possibility, but the patient has no history of recent travel, sick contacts, or changes in diet, and her white blood cell count is not significantly elevated. Autoimmune disease is another possibility, but tests for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative, making conditions such as lupus or vasculitis less likely. The patient's rash, fever, and weight loss could be consistent with Still's disease, an inflammatory condition characterized by high fevers, rash, and joint pain. However, the patient does not report joint pain. The skin biopsy may provide further information to help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis:\nThe diagnosis is currently unclear and pending further investigation, such as the results of the skin biopsy.""

The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when she developed a fever, fatigue, and a rash on her trunk and extremities. She also reported a 10-pound weight loss over the past month. She had no history of recent travel, sick contacts, or changes in her diet. She had no known drug allergies and was not taking any medications. She had a history of hypertension and was a former smoker. On physical examination, the patient appeared ill. Her temperature was 38.5\u00b0C, blood pressure was 110/70 mm Hg, pulse rate was 90 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute. She had a diffuse, maculopapular rash on her trunk and extremities. There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The remainder of the examination was normal. Laboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 12,000 per cubic millimeter, with 70% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes, and 10% monocytes. The hemoglobin level was 10 g per deciliter, and the platelet count was 150,000 per cubic millimeter. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 50 mm per hour. The serum creatinine level was 1.0 mg per deciliter, and the serum albumin level was 3.0 g per deciliter. The alanine aminotransferase level was 40 U per liter, and the aspartate aminotransferase level was 45 U per liter. The alkaline phosphatase level was 100 U per liter, and the total bilirubin level was 1.0 mg per deciliter. The serum lactate dehydrogenase level was 500 U per liter. The serum protein electrophoresis showed a polyclonal increase in gamma globulins. The antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160, and the rheumatoid factor was 80 IU per milliliter. The serum complement levels were normal. The hepatitis B and C serologies were negative. The HIV antibody test was negative. A chest radiograph showed no abnormalities. A skin biopsy of a lesion on the patient's arm showed a dense, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with numerous plasma cells. Immunofluorescence studies showed granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the dermoepidermal junction.\n\nRationale (REMEMBER TO CREATE A DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS):\nThe patient's presentation of fever, fatigue, rash, and weight loss is suggestive of an inflammatory or autoimmune process. The differential diagnosis includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and lymphoma. The patient's laboratory findings of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, polyclonal increase in gamma globulins, and positive antinuclear antibody titer further support an autoimmune process. The skin biopsy showing a lymphocytic infiltrate with plasma cells and granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the dermoepidermal junction is characteristic of lupus erythematosus. The absence of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly makes lymphoma less likely. The patient does not have joint pain or swelling, which makes rheumatoid arthritis less likely. The normal complement levels and absence of symptoms such as sinusitis or hematuria make vasculitis less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\nDiagnosis:\nSystemic Lupus Erythematosus.""

The patient's history of a 1-cm ovarian cyst and the location of her pain could suggest an ovarian cyst rupture, but her lack of sexual activity makes pelvic inflammatory disease unlikely. Her symptoms started after eating at a restaurant, which could suggest gastroenteritis, but her travel companion who ate similar food did not fall ill. Appendicitis could also present with these symptoms, but the patient's pain is bilateral and not localized to the right lower quadrant. Diverticulitis could also present with these symptoms, but it is less common in a patient of this age. The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, which is indicative of an infection or inflammation. The patient's chest radiograph showed low lung volumes and patchy bibasilar opacities, which could suggest aspiration pneumonia, possibly due to vomiting. This could explain the patient's chills and fever. \n\nDiagnosis: Aspiration pneumonia secondary to gastroenteritis.""

He also reports a history of polyuria and polydipsia, which have since resolved, and blurred vision. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Klinefelter syndrome, hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia, and a pituitary tumor. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that results in small testicles, gynecomastia, and decreased facial hair, but it does not typically cause seizures, polyuria, or polydipsia. Hypogonadism can cause gynecomastia and small testicles, but it also does not typically cause seizures, polyuria, or polydipsia. Hyperprolactinemia can cause gynecomastia and decreased facial hair, but it does not typically cause small testicles, seizures, polyuria, or polydipsia. A pituitary tumor, however, can cause all of these symptoms. A pituitary tumor can cause gynecomastia and decreased facial hair by disrupting the normal hormonal balance. It can cause small testicles by decreasing the production of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. It can cause seizures by growing large enough to compress the surrounding brain tissue. It can cause polyuria and polydipsia by disrupting the production of antidiuretic hormone, leading to diabetes insipidus. It can cause blurred vision by compressing the optic chiasm. Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, a pituitary tumor is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis: Pituitary tumor.""

However, the CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of cancer. The patient's history of excessive alcohol use and the presence of first-degree atrioventricular block and right bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram could suggest cardiac involvement. However, the most striking abnormality is the hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can be caused by several conditions, including hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, and certain medications. Given the patient's age, history, and the presence of a sclerotic lesion, malignancy-associated hypercalcemia is a strong possibility. This could be due to a paraneoplastic syndrome, in which a tumor produces a hormone (in this case, parathyroid hormone-related protein) that causes hypercalcemia. The absence of abdominal or pelvic cancer on CT scan does not rule out other types of cancer, such as multiple myeloma, which can cause lytic or sclerotic bone lesions and hypercalcemia. \n\nDiagnosis: Multiple Myeloma""

Given the patient's history of psoriatic arthritis, an autoimmune disease, the initial assumption is that the iritis is associated with this condition. However, the patient's vision and balance continue to worsen, and he develops sensorineural hearing loss. These symptoms, along with the presence of small, yellow preretinal infiltrates in the eye, suggest a systemic inflammatory condition.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes paranoid schizophrenia, severe depression with psychotic features, anorexia nervosa, and autoimmune thyroid disease. The patient's symptoms of psychosis began before any physical symptoms were noted, which could suggest a primary psychiatric disorder such as paranoid schizophrenia or severe depression with psychotic features. However, her lack of other symptoms of depression and the absence of auditory or visual hallucinations make these diagnoses less likely. The patient's significant weight loss, despite reported polyphagia, along with her perfectionist tendencies and excessive thinness, suggest the possibility of anorexia nervosa. This eating disorder can cause severe malnutrition, leading to a variety of physical symptoms including anemia and vitamin deficiencies. However, the patient's thyroid nodule and subsequent diagnoses of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinoma suggest an autoimmune thyroid disease. Autoimmune thyroid disease can cause a variety of psychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, particularly if the disease is severe or poorly controlled. The patient's persistent high thyrotropin level despite levothyroxine treatment suggests that her thyroid disease may not be well controlled.

The CT scan confirmed the presence of an acute infarction, and the patient was diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke due to occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. The patient's history of recurrent intermittent swelling of her left thigh since childhood, when she had undergone the surgical excision of a birthmark on the left inner thigh that had frequently bled, suggests a possible underlying coagulation disorder. However, the patient's platelet count, prothrombin time, and prothrombin-time international normalized ratio were normal, which does not support a coagulation disorder. The patient's history of migraine headaches and the use of aspirin several days per week for headaches could have contributed to the stroke. The patient's asthma and the use of asthma inhalers are not likely to be related to the stroke. The patient's troponin T level was elevated, which could indicate a myocardial infarction, but this was not confirmed by electrocardiography. The patient's carbon dioxide level was low, which could indicate respiratory alkalosis, but this was not confirmed by arterial blood gas analysis. The patient's phosphorus level was low, which could indicate malnutrition or malabsorption, but this was not confirmed by other laboratory tests. The patient's white-cell count was elevated, which could indicate an infection, but this was not confirmed by other laboratory tests. The patient's blood glucose level was elevated, which could indicate diabetes, but this was not confirmed by other laboratory tests. The patient's hematocrit, hemoglobin level, and platelet count were normal, which does not support anemia or thrombocytopenia. The patient's renal-function tests were normal, which does not support renal disease. The patient's lipase level was normal, which does not support pancreatitis. The patient's electrolyte levels were normal, which does not support electrolyte imbalance. The patient's calcium and magnesium levels were normal, which does not support hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia. The patient's toxicology screening was negative, which does not support drug or alcohol abuse. The patient's electrocardiogram was normal, which does not support cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarction. The patient's chest radiograph was normal, which does not support pneumonia or other lung disease. The patient's urinalysis was normal, which does not support urinary tract infection or renal disease. The patient's electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm and nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, which do not support cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarction. The patient's MRI of the head revealed restricted diffusion involving the left insula, posterior limb of the left internal capsule, and left medial temporal lobe, as well as punctate foci of restricted diffusion in the left frontal and parietal lobes and the right frontal lobe near the vertex; these findings are consistent with infarction involving the territory of the left middle cerebral artery. The patient's CT angiography of the head and neck revealed a diminutive proximal left internal carotid artery and no enhancement of the left internal carotid artery as it entered the base of the skull, as well as thrombus in the left paraclinoid and supraclinoid internal carotid artery that extended into the left middle cerebral artery (M1 and proximal M2 segments), with reconstitution of the sylvian branches and prominent collateral vessels. The patient's fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed hyperintensity in the branches of the left middle cerebral artery and in the petrous and cavernous segments of the left internal carotid artery; these findings are consistent with slow flow, which was seen on the earlier CT angiography. The presence of a focal area of susceptibility effect in the proximal left middle cerebral artery was consistent with the occlusive thrombus in the middle cerebral artery. The patient's NIHSS score was unchanged despite the administration of t-PA. One hour after the patient's arrival, she was transported to an angiography-equipped operating room for endovascular thrombectomy. The left internal carotid artery, anterior cerebral artery, and middle cerebral artery were successfully recanalized. On examination at the end of the procedure, the patient had mild difficulty with simple arithmetic but no other neurologic deficits; the NIHSS score was 0.

The patient's symptoms of sharp, stabbing chest pain that worsens with deep breaths and coughing, as well as his shortness of breath, are consistent with a pulmonary embolism.

His Glasgow Coma Scale score was 10, indicating reduced levels of consciousness. His blood pressure was significantly elevated. His lab results were largely normal, with the exception of a high glucose level. His CT scan revealed enlargement of the lateral ventricles and periventricular hypodensity, suggestive of hydrocephalus related to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. There was also a heterogeneous, partially hyperdense intraventricular lesion involving the ependyma. His MRI revealed marked enlargement of the lateral ventricles and prominent periventricular hyperintensity, consistent with acute hydrocephalus. There were enhancing lesions involving the ependyma of the anterior horn of the left lateral ventricle that extended toward the foramen of Monro. A smooth and nodular enhancing lesion extended into and partially filled the third ventricle. Given the heterogeneous enhancement, some of which had corresponding restricted diffusion, infection and cancer were the principal diagnostic considerations.

He also has a history of fatigue, headaches, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, low back pain, and dysuria. The patient has a history of exercise-induced asthma and was hospitalized during early childhood for diarrhea. He is sexually active with one female partner and reports consistent condom use. He smokes one cigarette each day, uses marijuana three times per week, and drinks alcohol intermittently. He has a pet rabbit but no contact with other animals, no history of recent tick or mosquito bites, and no contact with sick persons. There is no family history of renal stones or autoimmune disorders. The differential diagnosis for this patient includes sexually transmitted infections, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, appendicitis, and testicular torsion. The patient\u2019s urinalysis is normal, making urinary tract infection and kidney stones less likely. The patient\u2019s abdominal and pelvic CT scan revealed an ill-defined low-density material that tracked along the left retroperitoneum anterior to the left psoas muscle and aorta and into the pelvis, displacing the bladder to the right. Low-density material was also seen in the left paracolic gutter. The radiologic differential diagnosis included infectious and inflammatory causes with a possible pelvic, leg, or genitourinary source or traumatic injury to the bladder or ureter. There was no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, and other visualized structures in the abdomen, pelvis, and lower thorax were normal. The patient\u2019s MRI of the abdomen and pelvis revealed several prominent paraaortic, left common iliac, and left external iliac lymph nodes, some with central necrosis. Other structures visualized in the abdomen and pelvis were normal. The differential diagnosis for hypointense lymph nodes with probable necrosis includes atypical infectious processes (most likely bacterial), granulomatous processes (e.g., sarcoidosis), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, and mycobacterial infection, as well as cancer (e.g., lymphoma), although this diagnosis is unlikely. Given the patient\u2019s symptoms, history, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an atypical infectious process.\n\nDiagnosis: Atypical infectious process.""

Imaging revealed a homogeneous opacity in the right middle lobe, interlobular septal thickening, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, and a loculated right pleural effusion. Pleural fluid analysis showed lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, but no malignant cells. Despite antibiotic treatment, the patient's symptoms persisted and further imaging showed increasing nodular thickening of the right major fissure, a left pleural effusion, and a decreasing right pleural effusion. Pathological examination of specimens obtained from a percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy and core biopsy of the large mass in the right middle lobe showed mixed inflammation. The patient underwent thoracoscopy, lobectomies of the right middle and lower lobes, total pulmonary decortication, and dissection of mediastinal lymph nodes. Pathological examination revealed evidence of extensive lipoid pneumonia (i.e., the accumulation of lipids in the alveoli) and fibrinous pleuritis. The patient's persistent symptoms and the findings of lipids in the alveoli suggest a diagnosis of exogenous lipoid pneumonia, a rare condition caused by the inhalation or aspiration of fat-containing substances.""

The differential diagnosis includes lung cancer, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and fungal infection. The patient's history of exposure to yeast and mice could suggest a fungal infection, but the lack of response to antibiotics and the negative cultures make this less likely. The patient's history of epilepsy and hydrocephalus is not likely related to her current symptoms. The CT scan shows a homogeneous opacity in the right middle lobe, interlobular septal thickening, mediastinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy, and a loculated right pleural effusion. These findings could be consistent with a lung tumor, but the patient's young age and lack of smoking history make lung cancer less likely. The presence of Staphylococcus lugdunensis in the pleural fluid could suggest a bacterial infection, but the lack of response to antibiotics makes this less likely. The pathological examination of the lung mass shows mixed inflammation, which is not typical of lung cancer. The final clue is the presence of lipoid pneumonia on pathological examination. This condition is caused by the inhalation or aspiration of lipids, and can present with a lung mass and symptoms of pneumonia. The patient's history does not reveal a clear source of lipid exposure, but this diagnosis is the best fit for her clinical presentation and test results.""

His symptoms began with myalgias, arthralgias, chills, fever, and upper respiratory symptoms, which progressed to cough with blood-tinged sputum and pleuritic chest pain. Despite treatment with antibiotics, his symptoms persisted and worsened, leading to hospitalization and eventual transfer to the ICU. His chest radiographs showed severe consolidation in the left upper lobe and relatively mild consolidation in the right upper lobe, with further opacification of the left lung and worsening multifocal consolidation in the right lung over time. His sputum cultures grew candida species, but blood cultures were negative. \n\nThe differential diagnosis for this patient includes severe community-acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, and pneumonia secondary to an atypical pathogen. Given the severity of his symptoms and the progression of his disease despite antibiotic treatment, an atypical pathogen or resistant organism should be considered. His recent travel to Indonesia and Japan also raises the possibility of a foreign or tropical pathogen. However, his family history of _1-antitrypsin deficiency, a condition that can lead to lung disease, could also be contributing to his severe respiratory symptoms. \n\nGiven the patient's severe pneumonia that has not responded to broad-spectrum antibiotics, the presence of candida species in the sputum, and the lack of improvement despite treatment, the most likely diagnosis is invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This is a severe fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients or those with chronic lung disease. The patient's family history of _1-antitrypsin deficiency could suggest underlying lung disease that predisposed him to this infection. \n\nDiagnosis: Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis.""
