"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 56%
Eosinophils 11%
Lymphocytes 31%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h

Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL
Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",Cholesterol embolization,Thrombotic microangiopathy,N,Thrombotic microangiopathy.,N,Thrombotic microangiopathy.,N,Thrombotic microangiopathy,N,Atheroembolism,Y,,Cholesterol embolization syndrome,"This patient's presentation of decreased urinary output, elevated creatinine, and mottled purpura on the feet along with the kidney biopsy finding of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles suggest a diagnosis of cholesterol embolization syndrome (also known as atheroembolic renal disease). The timing of symptoms is also a clue; cholesterol embolization syndrome often occurs following invasive vascular procedures such as a cardiac catheterization. The procedure can dislodge atheromatous plaques from the aorta, causing them to embolize to the renal vasculature, among other places. These cholesterol crystals result in inflammation and tissue damage, leading to the clinical presentation described.",Y,Cholesterol embolization syndrome,"The differential for this patient includes acute kidney injury (AKI) due to various causes, such as contrast-induced nephropathy, drug-induced interstitial nephritis, cholesterol embolization, or diabetic nephropathy. The recent cardiac catheterization and onset of kidney symptoms within two weeks suggest contrast-induced nephropathy or cholesterol embolization syndrome. However, the presence of skin findings (mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet) and eosinophilia in the blood hint towards cholesterol embolization. The renal biopsy finding of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles confirms the presence of cholesterol crystals, which are pathognomonic for cholesterol embolization. Therefore, this patient's symptoms are most likely due to cholesterol embolization.",Y,Atheroembolic renal disease,"This patient has decreased urinary output, malaise, and a renal biopsy showing intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles which are indicative of cholesterol emboli or atheroembolic renal disease. This is typically seen after invasive vascular procedures, like cardiac catheterization in this patient, and can cause renal failure due to cholesterol crystal embolization to the renal arteries. The 'mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration' of the feet could suggest livedo reticularis, another feature of cholesterol embolism due to occlusion of small cutaneous arteries. Elevation in eosinophils and ESR are also common in atheroembolic renal disease. The patient also has an elevated creatinine, which suggests renal failure, a common outcome of atheroembolic renal disease.",Y,Cholesterol embolism,"The patient's recent history of cardiac catheterization with stenting, the decreased urinary output, and elevated creatinine levels are indicative of acute kidney injury (AKI). The presence of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles on renal biopsy and a mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet suggest a diagnosis of cholesterol embolism, also known as atheroembolic kidney disease. This condition arises when cholesterol crystals dislodge from atherosclerotic plaques, commonly during vascular procedures like cardiac catheterization. These emboli can occlude small arteries, causing end-organ damage. In this case, the patient's kidney is affected, leading to decreased urine output and elevated creatinine. The cutaneous findings (mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet) are indicative of livedo reticularis, a common dermatologic manifestation of cholesterol emboli.",Y,Contrast-induced nephropathy,"This patient's symptoms and clinical history suggest contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). The prior probability of CIN in patients undergoing procedures with contrast like cardiac catheterization is approximately 2% but can be much higher in patients with risk factors like diabetes mellitus. Given this patient's history of diabetes (which is a significant risk factor for CIN) and recent cardiac catheterization, the posterior probability for CIN might increase to 20%. The increased creatinine level is highly suggestive of acute kidney injury, which further increases the posterior probability of CIN to about 60%. The presence of decreased urinary output and malaise (symptoms often associated with renal dysfunction) can elevate the probability to approximately 80%. The biopsy findings of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles could be related to cholesterol embolization, which can be a complication of catheterization procedures and cause renal damage, making the final posterior probability for this diagnosis approximately 90%.",N
"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of altered mental status. He was found on the floor in front of his apartment. He is somnolent but responsive when aroused. His pulse is 64/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, an alcoholic smell and slurred speech are noted. Neurological exam shows diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and an ataxic gait. His pupils are normal. Blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%. An ECG shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Benzodiazepine intoxication,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,,Alcoholic neuropathy,"This patient presents with altered mental status, a smell of alcohol, slurred speech, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and an ataxic gait. Despite having a low blood alcohol concentration, the combination of these symptoms suggests neurological damage related to chronic alcohol use. In this case, the diminished deep tendon reflexes and ataxic gait specifically suggest peripheral neuropathy, which is often caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency due to chronic alcohol use. This condition, known as alcoholic neuropathy, can occur in people who have consumed large amounts of alcohol over a long period of time.",N,Cerebellar disease,"The differential for this patient includes alcohol intoxication, withdrawal from alcohol, illicit drug use, head trauma, stroke, hypoglycemia, or a neurological condition such as Wernicke's encephalopathy or cerebellar disease. Given that his blood alcohol concentration is low (0.04%) and he does not show symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, we can rule out alcohol intoxication and withdrawal. There is no evidence in the scenario of illicit drug use, and the patient does not display any symptoms indicative of head trauma or stroke. His blood pressure and heart rate are normal, which makes hypoglycemia less likely. The patient's altered mental status, slurred speech, and ataxic gait are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, without evidence of eye movement abnormalities or evidence of malnutrition or chronic alcohol abuse, this is less likely. The diminished deep tendon reflexes, ataxic gait, and slurred speech are consistent with cerebellar disease. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cerebellar disease.",N,Wernicke's encephalopathy,"This patient's symptoms of altered mental status, alcoholic smell, slurred speech, diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally, and ataxic gait suggest chronic alcohol abuse. However, his blood alcohol concentration is relatively low, which suggests that his symptoms are not solely due to alcohol intoxication. The presence of ataxia and diminished deep tendon reflexes, coupled with chronic alcohol abuse, are classic signs of thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, also known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. This condition commonly occurs in chronic alcoholics due to poor nutritional intake and decreased absorption and storage of thiamine.",N,Wernicke's encephalopathy,"The patient's symptoms (somnolence, slurred speech, diminished deep tendon reflexes, ataxic gait) and the alcoholic smell suggest chronic alcohol misuse. Despite a blood alcohol concentration that's below the legal limit for impairment, he still displays signs of intoxication, indicating tolerance, another hallmark of chronic use. Chronic alcohol abuse can result in thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, leading to Wernicke's encephalopathy. This condition, which can occur in nonalcoholic states of malnutrition as well, is characterized by altered mental status, oculomotor dysfunction, and gait ataxia, which matches the clinical picture. Therefore, this patient most likely has Wernicke's encephalopathy caused by chronic alcohol misuse and resultant thiamine deficiency.",N,Wernicke's encephalopathy,"The prior probability of Wernicke's encephalopathy is typically low in the general population. However, in this case, the patient is showing signs of alcoholism (alcoholic smell, slurred speech), which significantly increases the prior probability. We also note neurological abnormalities like diminished deep tendon reflexes and ataxic gait, which are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, thereby increasing the posterior probability. The low blood alcohol concentration indicates that his current state is likely not due to acute intoxication. Therefore, considering his signs and the condition's prevalence in chronic alcoholics, the posterior probability of Wernicke's encephalopathy is high.",N
"A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Histoplasma capsulatum infection,Valley Fever,N,Coccidioidomycosis,N,Histoplasmosis,Y,Fungal infection,N,Valley Fever,N,,Histoplasmosis,"This patient has recently been hiking in Mississippi, presenting with symptoms of fever, chills, dry cough, and chest discomfort. She also has a history of asthma and a heavy smoking habit, which might predispose her to respiratory infections. She tests positive for a polysaccharide antigen and bronchoalveolar lavage reveals a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae in macrophages. The dimorphic nature of the fungus and the septate hyphae are characteristic of Histoplasma capsulatum, a fungus endemic to the Mississippi River Valley. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is histoplasmosis, a fungal infection caused by inhalation of Histoplasma capsulatum spores.",Y,Histoplasmosis,"The differential diagnosis in this case includes: community-acquired pneumonia (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (given her asthma history and smoking habit), tuberculosis (given her mother's methotrexate use), and histoplasmosis (given her travel history to Mississippi and finding of dimorphic fungi).

Looking at the given information:

She was hiking in Mississippi 10 days ago - an endemic area for histoplasmosis. Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus, meaning it can exist in two forms. In the environment, it exists as a mold with septate hyphae. In the body, it converts to a yeast form. It resides within macrophages after inhalation, which corresponds with the bronchoalveolar lavage findings.
Her symptoms of fever, chills, dry cough, chest discomfort, headaches, muscle aches, and joint pain, are consistent with acute histoplasmosis. Additionally, polysaccharide antigen tests can be used to detect Histoplasma capsulatum in urine, blood, or other body fluids, which supports the diagnosis.
While allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis could theoretically present with similar respiratory symptoms, it doesn't align with the presentation of a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae residing within macrophages.
Thus, taking all this into consideration, the most likely diagnosis for her symptoms is histoplasmosis.",Y,Histoplasmosis,"This patient presents with fever, cough, chest discomfort, and systemic symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches, and joint pain after hiking in Mississippi. The detection of a polysaccharide antigen in laboratory studies and a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae in bronchoalveolar lavage suggest a fungal infection, most likely Histoplasma capsulatum. This fungus is endemic in the Mississippi River valley and can cause a systemic infection with pulmonary and extrapulmonary manifestations in humans, especially in those with chronic respiratory conditions like asthma. These factors together suggest that this patient's symptoms are likely due to Histoplasmosis.",Y,Histoplasmosis,"The patient's history of recent hiking in Mississippi combined with her symptoms of dry cough, chest discomfort, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills suggests an infectious process, specifically a fungal infection. The detection of polysaccharide antigen and the bronchoalveolar lavage findings of macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae are key to diagnosing the cause. The fungus described is consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, which is endemic in the Mississippi River Valley area. The mold form of Histoplasma, found in soil, transforms into the yeast form in human body temperature and can lead to a systemic disease known as Histoplasmosis. The yeast form is engulfed by macrophages, as seen in the bronchoalveolar lavage, and can cause the symptoms presented by the patient.",Y,Histoplasma capsulatum,"The prior probability of Histoplasmosis (a fungal infection often acquired through inhalation of spores in certain geographic areas such as the Mississippi River Valley) given the patient's recent hiking trip in Mississippi could be assumed at around 10%. The presence of fever, cough, and chest discomfort increases the likelihood of this being a respiratory infection, raising the probability to perhaps 20%. Further, the fact that the patient's mother is being treated with methotrexate suggests possible genetic predisposition to immune-related diseases, although it doesn't directly imply histoplasmosis, it can increase the suspicion to around 25%.

The patient's condition has not improved with the use of an albuterol inhaler, which would typically ameliorate symptoms of asthma, this suggests an alternative cause for the respiratory symptoms, perhaps raising the probability of Histoplasmosis to 30%. The significant detail here is the identification of a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae in a bronchoalveolar lavage sample. Histoplasma is a dimorphic fungus, which substantially increases the posterior probability of Histoplasmosis to above 80% or even higher.",Y
"A 67-year-old man who was diagnosed with arthritis 16 years ago presents with right knee swelling and pain. His left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now with both joints affected, he has difficulty walking and feels frustrated. He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest. He also suffers from dandruff for which he uses special shampoos. Physical examination is notable for pitting of his nails. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Psoriatic arthritis,Psoriatic arthritis,Y,Psoriatic arthritis,Y,Psoriatic arthritis,Y,Psoriatic arthritis,Y,Psoriatic arthritis,Y,,Psoriatic Arthritis,"This patient has a long history of arthritis affecting multiple joints and back pain, along with nail pitting and dandruff. These are typical signs of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a form of inflammatory arthritis that can cause pain, swelling and sometimes damage to any joint in the body. Nail pitting and dandruff (scalp psoriasis) are characteristic of psoriasis, a skin condition that frequently accompanies this type of arthritis.",Y,Psoriatic Arthritis,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudogout, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. His long history of arthritis and recent involvement of multiple joints, including the knees, is suggestive of an inflammatory arthritis. The fact that his pain improves with rest goes against osteoarthritis which usually worsens with activity and improves with rest. His back pain that makes it difficult to move can be a feature of ankylosing spondylitis. However, his age of onset is not typical for ankylosing spondylitis, which usually starts in younger adults. The presence of dandruff (possible psoriasis) and nail pitting strongly suggests psoriatic arthritis. Psoriasis often precedes the onset of arthritis in psoriatic arthritis, and nail changes (such as pitting) are commonly seen in this condition. Therefore, this patient most likely has psoriatic arthritis.",Y,Psoriatic Arthritis,"The patient's clinical presentation suggests psoriatic arthritis. The patient's history of arthritis with intermittent swelling and pain in different joints over time, as well as the back pain that improves with rest, is indicative of an inflammatory arthropathy such as psoriatic arthritis. Inflammatory back pain that improves with rest is a hallmark of spondyloarthropathies, which include psoriatic arthritis. Furthermore, the nail pitting and dandruff (which might represent scalp psoriasis) are specific dermatological features commonly associated with psoriatic arthritis.",Y,Psoriatic Arthritis,"The patient presents with several features suggestive of psoriatic arthritis, a form of inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis. The symptoms include arthritis with a pattern of involvement that can be asymmetric (like in this case with one knee affected first and then the other), back pain suggestive of possible spondylitis, and characteristic skin and nail changes of psoriasis (dandruff-like scalp symptoms and nail pitting). The fact that his pain improves with rest but is worse with activity is also indicative of an inflammatory process. Based on these signs and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is psoriatic arthritis.",Y,Psoriatic Arthritis,"The prior probability of psoriatic arthritis is about 10-15% in the general population. However, this patient has several signs that increase the likelihood of psoriatic arthritis. He has joint pain and swelling, which can be seen in many types of arthritis, but the intermittent nature of the symptoms (his left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now his right knee is swollen) is more typical of psoriatic arthritis, increasing the posterior probability to about 20%. The back pain that improves with rest is indicative of axial involvement, which further increases the posterior probability to about 40%. Finally, the pitting of his nails is a classic sign of psoriasis, which is directly linked to psoriatic arthritis, bringing the posterior probability up to around 80-85%. Given these symptoms, psoriatic arthritis is the most likely diagnosis.",Y
"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

What is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?",Duodenal atresia,Gastroschisis,N,Intestinal obstruction,N,Gastroschisis,N,Duodenal atresia,Y,Gastroschisis,N,,Duodenal atresia,"The baby in question is displaying signs of intestinal obstruction, as evidenced by bilious vomiting and a failure to pass meconium within the first day of life, as well as an abdomen that is distended and firm with hypoactive bowel sounds. A common cause of this situation in newborns is Hirschsprung disease, a congenital condition that causes a lack of innervation in a segment of the bowel, most commonly the rectosigmoid region. This condition is typically associated with failure to pass meconium within the first 48 hours of life. However, this does not seem to align with the prenatal findings of the mother.

The prenatal findings of decreased AFP, increased hCG, decreased estriol, and increased inhibin A suggest a risk for Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) in the fetus. One of the complications associated with Down syndrome is duodenal atresia, a condition in which the duodenum is not completely formed, leading to obstruction of the intestines. The presence of bilious vomiting and abdominal distension in the neonate, in conjunction with the abnormal prenatal findings, make duodenal atresia a strong possibility in this case.",Y,Duodenal atresia,"This neonate presents with bilious vomiting, a distended abdomen, and a history of failure to pass meconium, all of which are indicative of a bowel obstruction. The differential for this presentation could include Hirschsprung disease, meconium ileus (which is associated with cystic fibrosis), intestinal atresia, malrotation with midgut volvulus, or meconium plug syndrome.

Given the prenatal history, however, we can lean towards a specific diagnosis. The quadruple screen revealed decreased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and estriol, increased beta-hCG and inhibin A, all of which are suggestive of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21). This condition is associated with certain congenital anomalies including congenital heart disease and gastrointestinal malformations such as duodenal atresia, which presents with bilious vomiting within the first day of life, failure to pass meconium, and a 'double bubble' sign on abdominal imaging.

The other diagnoses in the differential are less likely. For instance, Hirschsprung disease typically presents later, and meconium ileus is usually seen in infants with a family history of cystic fibrosis. Intestinal malrotation and volvulus would present with a more acute onset of severe abdominal pain. Lastly, meconium plug syndrome often affects preterm infants and those with Hirschsprung disease, but the prenatal history does not support these conditions.

Given the combination of prenatal screening results and the patient's clinical picture, the most likely cause of this infant's symptoms is duodenal atresia associated with Down Syndrome.",Y,Meconium ileus,"This neonate's clinical presentation of bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium within the first day of life, and abdominal distension are all consistent with intestinal obstruction. In the neonatal period, the most common causes of obstruction are atresias, and the most common site of atresia is the duodenum. However, given the bilious vomiting (which generally indicates obstruction distal to the ampulla of Vater), the abdominal distension, and the absence of meconium passage, this likely suggests a more distal obstruction such as Hirschsprung disease or meconium ileus.

Hirschsprung disease (also known as congenital aganglionic megacolon) is a disorder characterized by the absence of ganglionic cells in myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexus of the rectosigmoid, which results in functional obstruction and proximal intestinal dilatation.

However, meconium ileus is associated with cystic fibrosis and is characterized by the impaction of abnormally viscous, sticky meconium mixed with mucus in the ileum. In cystic fibrosis, prenatal findings may include polyhydramnios due to impaired intestinal absorption of swallowed amniotic fluid, which aligns with the maternal history of a high amniotic fluid index.

Given the overall clinical scenario and prenatal history, meconium ileus due to underlying cystic fibrosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",N,Intestinal atresia,"The symptoms presented by this neonate, such as bilious vomiting and absence of meconium passage within the first day of life, suggest intestinal obstruction. Distention of the abdomen also points towards this. The prenatal findings are also important here, with increased amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) and a quadruple screen result showing abnormal levels of maternal serum AFP, beta-hCG, unconjugated estriol, and inhibin A. Polyhydramnios often arises due to an inability of the fetus to swallow and absorb amniotic fluid, which can occur in cases of intestinal obstruction. Although these screening results could indicate different abnormalities, in this context they add to the suspicion of a gastrointestinal malformation. Of the conditions that could lead to this type of presentation, Hirschsprung's disease and intestinal atresia are two main considerations. However, Hirschsprung's disease typically would not prevent the passage of meconium in the first day. Therefore, this clinical presentation is most suggestive of intestinal atresia, where a segment of the intestine is completely absent or closed, preventing the normal passage of bowel contents.",Y,Duodenal atresia in Down Syndrome,"In Bayesian reasoning, we begin with a prior probability and then update this probability as we encounter new evidence.

Given the symptoms described, we can start with a list of conditions that are common in newborns with bilious vomiting and absence of meconium: Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, and intestinal atresia. The prior probability of these conditions may be similar, with no specific condition as the ""front runner"".

The information that the baby hasn't passed meconium increases the likelihood of conditions that cause bowel obstruction. So the posterior probability of Hirschsprung's disease, meconium ileus, and intestinal atresia goes up.

Given the baby's presentation with a distended abdomen, hypoactive bowel sounds, and signs of moderate distress, the probability of some form of intestinal obstruction, such as intestinal atresia or Hirschsprung's disease, is further increased.

However, the important clue here lies in the maternal history. The mother had a quadruple screen test with decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. This is indicative of Down syndrome.

The presence of Down syndrome significantly increases the risk of Hirschsprung's disease and duodenal atresia. The baby's presentation of bilious vomiting, absent meconium passage, firm and distended abdomen is strongly suggestive of duodenal atresia, which is a common gastrointestinal manifestation in Down syndrome.

Therefore, given the signs of intestinal obstruction, and the likelihood of Down Syndrome due to the abnormal maternal screen, the most likely etiology is duodenal atresia related to Down Syndrome.",Y
"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Femoropopliteal artery stenosis,Diabetic neuropathy,N,Peripheral artery disease.,Y,Peripheral artery disease,Y,Peripheral vascular disease,Y,Diabetic neuropathy,N,,Peripheral Artery Disease,"This patient is experiencing intermittent claudication, or pain that occurs in the muscles during exercise and improves with rest. The fact that he has smoked heavily for many years and has a history of type 2 diabetes means that he is at a high risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD). The absence of pedal pulses on the right side further indicates decreased arterial perfusion, which is consistent with PAD. Moreover, the fact that the pain is worsened by elevating the leg (which would reduce blood flow due to gravity) and relieved by lowering the leg is another clue toward ischemic pain due to PAD. Also, the absence of back pain rules out lumbar radiculopathy, and the normal muscle strength rules out a primary muscle disorder.",Y,Peripheral Artery Disease,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes peripheral artery disease (PAD), lumbar spinal stenosis, peripheral neuropathy, and venous insufficiency.

The patient's history of smoking and type 2 diabetes significantly increases his risk for peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is characterized by atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities. Classic symptoms include calf pain that occurs with exercise (claudication) and is relieved by rest, as in this patient. The pain with leg elevation (ischemic rest pain) and absence of right pedal pulses are further indicators of severe disease.

Lumbar spinal stenosis would typically present with neurogenic claudication characterized by lower extremity pain, numbness and/or weakness provoked by standing, lumbar extension, and walking. These symptoms improve with lumbar flexion, rest, and sitting. But this patient's pain does not seem to be dependent on posture or specific movement of the back.

Peripheral neuropathy could also cause tingling and numbness in the feet, but it wouldn't usually cause exercise-induced calf pain or be relieved by rest.

Venous insufficiency would cause pain that gets worse with leg hanging down and improves with leg elevation, the opposite of what's seen in this case.

Therefore, given the patient's history, symptoms, and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is peripheral artery disease.",Y,Peripheral Arterial Disease,"This patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, heavy smoking, hypertension, and the symptoms of calf pain during exercise (which disappears with rest), the absence of pedal pulses in the right foot, and symptoms being induced by the straight leg raise test indicate peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD typically presents as claudication (pain in the legs with exertion, often affecting the calf muscles) and it is related to decreased blood flow due to atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries. The risk factors for PAD include smoking, diabetes, and hypertension, all of which this patient has.",Y,Peripheral Artery Disease,"This patient has several risk factors for peripheral artery disease (PAD), including long-standing smoking history, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. His symptoms of calf claudication (cramping pain that occurs with exercise and is relieved with rest), pallor of the foot on elevation, and absence of pedal pulses on the right side are classic for PAD. PAD is a result of atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the lower extremities, leading to inadequate blood flow. It's important to note that back pain is not typically associated with PAD, and that seems to be the case with this patient. The patient's symptoms are associated with the level of the occlusive disease, which in this case seems to be in the lower leg.",Y,Peripheral Artery Disease,"The prior probability of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in a patient with a long history of smoking and diabetes is around 20%. The presence of exercise-induced calf pain (claudication) that resolves with rest increases the likelihood of PAD to around 50%. The symptom of pain in the foot when it's raised above chest level (indicating possible ischemia when gravity reduces arterial inflow), takes the probability of PAD up to about 70%. Absence of pedal pulses on the right side further raises the probability to 90%. A normal straight leg raise test, which would generally suggest a lumbar spine issue if positive, combined with absence of back pain, makes a lumbar spine pathology unlikely, bolstering the likelihood of PAD further. Therefore, this patient most likely has peripheral arterial disease.",Y
"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?",Aldosterone excess,Primary hyperaldosteronism,Y,Primary aldosteronism,Y,Primary aldosteronism,Y,Primary hypertension,N,Primary hyperaldosteronism,Y,,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,"The patient presents with fatigue, muscle cramps, and hypertension. He is also on medication for hypertension, but his blood pressure is still elevated, suggesting secondary hypertension. His lab results reveal hypokalemia (low potassium) and metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate), which are classic findings in hyperaldosteronism. Hyperaldosteronism is a condition where the adrenal glands produce too much of the hormone aldosterone, causing the kidneys to retain sodium and water, leading to high blood pressure. This syndrome can be primary or secondary, but primary is more common. The primary type, also called Conn's syndrome, is often caused by an adenoma in the adrenal glands. On the other hand, secondary hyperaldosteronism could be caused by conditions like renal artery stenosis, heart failure, or liver cirrhosis. Given this patient's symptoms and lab findings, primary hyperaldosteronism appears to be the most likely cause of his hypertension.",Y,Primary Aldosteronism,"The differential diagnosis for the underlying etiology of hypertension in this patient could include essential (primary) hypertension, secondary hypertension due to renal disease, renovascular disease, primary aldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, or coarctation of the aorta.

First, we can consider the most common cause of hypertension, which is essential hypertension. However, the lab results and the fact that this patient's blood pressure is not well controlled despite being on multiple antihypertensive medications suggest that this could be a case of secondary hypertension.

Given this patient's laboratory findings, we can notice that the potassium level is on the lower side (3.3 mEq/L, reference range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L). This hypokalemia could be due to the thiazide diuretic he's taking (hydrochlorothiazide), but it's also common in conditions like primary aldosteronism, which leads to increased renal potassium excretion.

In addition to this, there is also a slightly elevated bicarbonate level (HCO3-: 33 mEq/L, reference range: 22-28 mEq/L) indicating metabolic alkalosis, another common feature of primary aldosteronism. Primary aldosteronism, or Conn's syndrome, is a condition characterized by excess production of aldosterone, usually due to an adenoma in one of the adrenal glands or by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.

Thus, given the resistant hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis in this patient, primary aldosteronism is the most likely underlying cause of his hypertension.",Y,Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome),"This patient presents with hypertension, hypokalemia (K+ 3.3 mEq/L; normal range: 3.5-5.0 mEq/L), and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3-: 33 mEq/L; normal range: 22-28 mEq/L). This combination of signs is highly suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome), a condition characterized by the overproduction of aldosterone from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone promotes renal sodium and water retention, leading to increased blood pressure. Moreover, it enhances renal potassium excretion, leading to hypokalemia. The exchange of potassium for hydrogen ions in the kidneys can also cause metabolic alkalosis. While his antihypertensive medication, hydrochlorothiazide, might also contribute to these lab findings, it is less likely to be the sole cause considering his uncontrolled hypertension and pronounced hypokalemia.",Y,Primary Hyperaldosteronism,"This patient has hypertension, fatigue, and muscle cramps with laboratory values showing hypokalemia (K+: 3.3 mEq/L, normal is 3.5-5.5 mEq/L) and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3-: 33 mEq/L, normal is 22-28 mEq/L). He is taking a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), and a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine). Thiazide diuretics can cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but they should not result in refractory hypertension as they are a first-line treatment for hypertension. Lisinopril and amlodipine are also effective antihypertensives, indicating that there's likely another pathology contributing to his resistant hypertension. His presentation is suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (also known as Conn's syndrome), a condition characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal glands. This leads to sodium retention, potassium excretion (hence, hypokalemia), and resultant hypertension. The metabolic alkalosis occurs because aldosterone promotes hydrogen ion secretion, which in turn raises bicarbonate levels in the blood.",Y,Hyperaldosteronism,"This patient presents with fatigue, muscle cramps, hypertension, and hypokalemia (K+ 3.3 mEq/L).

First, we should consider the prior probability of different causes for hypertension. Primary (or essential) hypertension is the most common cause, accounting for approximately 90-95% of cases, while secondary hypertension accounts for the remaining 5-10%.
However, this patient's hypokalemia suggests the possibility of secondary hypertension due to a cause that also leads to low potassium levels. The hypokalemia increases the posterior probability of secondary hypertension causes that can lead to low potassium levels, such as hyperaldosteronism.
The patient's presentation of fatigue and muscle cramps are signs of hypokalemia and can be seen in conditions like hyperaldosteronism, which increases the probability of hyperaldosteronism as the cause of hypertension to about 30%.
Furthermore, the patient is on lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor) and amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker), both of which usually tend to increase potassium levels. However, the fact that the patient is still hypokalemic despite being on these medications increases the posterior probability of a condition like hyperaldosteronism to about 60%.
Lastly, the patient is on hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that can also cause hypokalemia and slightly elevate blood pressure. However, it is unlikely that this alone would cause the patient's severe hypertension and persistent hypokalemia in the context of concurrent lisinopril and amlodipine use. Thus, it likely does not significantly alter the posterior probability of hyperaldosteronism.
Based on this Bayesian analysis, the most likely cause of this patient's hypertension appears to be hyperaldosteronism, a form of secondary hypertension.",Y
"A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively.

These symptoms are consistent with tardive dyskinesia, a condition that is often a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications, especially the typical antipsychotics like haloperidol. Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive, involuntary, and purposeless movements.",Y,Tardive dyskinesia,"The differential for this patient includes tardive dyskinesia, acute dystonic reaction, pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. These are all potential side effects of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The onset of symptoms a few weeks after starting haloperidol and the presence of smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively favor tardive dyskinesia. Acute dystonic reactions usually occur within days of starting a medication. Pseudoparkinsonism would present with bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Akathisia is a state of restlessness, often with pacing, shifting from foot to foot, and an inability to sit still.

What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Hemolytic uremic syndrome,Hemolytic-uremic syndrome,Y,Hemolytic anemia,N,Hemolytic anemia,N,Hemolytic anemia,N,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,Y,,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,"This child's presentation includes recent abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody diarrhea, pallor, lethargy, and recent travel in Mexico. The physical examination reveals scleral icterus (yellowing of the eyes due to elevated bilirubin), and the laboratory findings indicate hemolytic anemia (low hemoglobin, high lactate dehydrogenase, and schistocytes on blood smear), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and renal impairment (elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine). These symptoms align with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), a condition often precipitated by an infection with a Shiga toxin-producing bacteria (such as E.coli O157:H7), which could have been acquired during his travel in Mexico.",Y,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes conditions that cause hemolytic anemia and renal dysfunction, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

The child has recently been to Mexico where he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. This points to a probable infectious etiology, particularly a bacterial infection that can lead to HUS. HUS is often caused by certain strains of E. coli, which produce Shiga toxin and are typically acquired from contaminated food or water.

The laboratory findings also support a diagnosis of HUS. The patient's hemoglobin is low, indicating anemia. The blood smear shows schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells indicative of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia�a key feature of HUS. The patient also has renal impairment, as indicated by elevated urea and creatinine levels, another characteristic of HUS. Finally, the patient's platelet count is low, pointing to thrombocytopenia. In HUS, platelets get consumed in the formation of microthrombi within the small blood vessels of the kidneys and other organs.

In contrast, TTP might be less likely, as it is usually seen in adults and often presents with neurological symptoms. DIC typically shows prolongation of PT and aPTT, which are normal in this case. PNH is a rare acquired disorder and doesn't typically present with an infection-related history.

In conclusion, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this child most likely has hemolytic uremic syndrome.",Y,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,"This child is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS), which is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS is commonly seen in children following an infection with Shiga toxin-producing organisms such as E. coli, often acquired from contaminated food or water which is consistent with his recent trip to Mexico. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea followed by pallor and lethargy due to anemia and kidney injury. In this case, the blood smear showing schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells), the decreased hemoglobin and platelet count, the increased LDH (which indicates cellular damage), and the elevated creatinine and BUN (which indicate renal dysfunction) all support the diagnosis of HUS.",Y,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,"The symptoms of this patient suggest that he is suffering from Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). The evidence includes recent gastroenteritis with bloody diarrhea, which is typically associated with an infection by the bacterium Escherichia coli, particularly the O157:H7 strain, common in uncooked or undercooked meat or contaminated water/produce, which can be likely during his trip to Mexico. In some cases, this bacterium releases toxins, causing damage to the endothelial cells of the capillaries in the kidneys and leading to HUS.

HUS is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (indicated by the presence of schistocytes on the blood smear, pallor due to low hemoglobin, and increased lactate dehydrogenase from the breakdown of red blood cells), thrombocytopenia (shown by a decreased platelet count), and acute renal injury (suggested by elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine).

Scleral icterus and increased total bilirubin could be seen due to the breakdown of red blood cells (hemolysis).",Y,Hemolytic uremic syndrome,"The prior probability of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in a young child with gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea) and a recent history of travel in a region with potential E. coli O157:H7 exposure (Mexico) can be estimated at around 5%.

The presence of anemia (Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL) and pallor in the child increases the posterior probability of HUS to 15%, as both are common signs of HUS.

The elevated creatinine level (1.6 mg/dL) indicative of renal dysfunction further raises the likelihood of HUS to 30%, given that HUS is often characterized by acute renal failure.

The low platelet count (45,000/mm3) is another common feature in HUS, reflecting thrombocytopenia due to platelet aggregation in small blood vessels. This observation would increase the probability of HUS to approximately 50%.

The presence of schistocytes on the blood smear (which are fragmented red blood cells often seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia such as HUS) would further increase the likelihood of HUS to around 70%.

The icterus, indicative of hyperbilirubinemia, along with the elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH - an enzyme that is often high when there is tissue damage or red blood cells are breaking down, as in hemolysis) push the posterior probability of HUS over 90%.

Given these multiple supportive findings, the patient most likely has Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome.",Y
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable.

He also has a swelling in the neck. The mother has a history of Graves' disease, an autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid gland, leading to hyperthyroidism. This condition can result in the passage of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) from the mother to the baby during pregnancy, which can stimulate the baby's thyroid, causing neonatal Graves' disease, also known as neonatal hyperthyroidism. The thyroid swelling (goiter) further points towards this diagnosis. The mother's thyroidectomy would not affect the presence of these antibodies in her system.",Y,Neonatal Graves' Disease,"The differential for this patient includes: hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, dehydration, infection, metabolic disease, and malnutrition. Given the maternal history of Graves' disease and the baby's symptoms (irritability, tachycardia, diaphoresis, poor weight gain, and neck swelling), this strongly suggests neonatal hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland in the neck might be enlarged due to thyroid stimulation from maternal anti-thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies that crossed the placenta, leading to the swelling observed at the midline of the neck. This condition, often called neonatal Graves' disease, can lead to the aforementioned symptoms and signs due to excess thyroid hormones. While the mother's Graves' disease was treated (hence she herself is now on L-thyroxine replacement), the antibodies can still circulate and cross the placenta to affect the baby, even after birth.",Y,Neonatal Hyperthyroidism,"This neonate presents with poor weight gain despite adequate breastfeeding, irritability, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and lack of subcutaneous fat. These are all signs of hypermetabolism typically associated with hyperthyroidism.

This implies a significant force to the chest. The patient is tachycardic and has chest pain. Also, he has chest wall bruising, suggesting direct trauma to the chest. The elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which may be seen in myocardial contusion. Additionally, troponin levels, which are markers of myocardial injury, are elevated. Myocardial contusion, or bruising of the heart muscle, is a common result of blunt chest trauma and can present with symptoms similar to those of a heart attack. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a myocardial contusion.",Y,Myocardial Contusion,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes myocardial infarction, myocardial contusion, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, and aortic dissection. Given his history of a front-seat, head-on collision without restraints, the bruising on his chest wall, and the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, myocardial contusion is a very likely possibility. Myocardial contusion is a type of cardiac injury that can occur as a result of blunt chest trauma, as in this patient's case. Elevation in troponin levels can also be seen in myocardial contusion, as these are markers of cardiac injury. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is less likely given his age and the nature of his trauma. While pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection could potentially occur after such an accident, the localized chest wall bruising and elevated cardiac markers make myocardial contusion more likely.",Y,Myocardial Contusion,"This patient was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision and has bruising over his chest wall. This, in combination with his chest pain and elevated troponin levels, suggests a cardiac contusion, a condition often associated with blunt chest trauma. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure could be elevated due to left ventricular dysfunction resulting from the myocardial injury. His echocardiogram may not show specific changes, as sinus tachycardia can be a non-specific sign of stress or pain, rather than indicative of an arrhythmia. Therefore, this patient's symptoms are most likely due to a myocardial contusion.",Y,Myocardial Contusion,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of a traumatic cardiac injury given his recent involvement in a motor vehicle collision and unrestrained status, which could have resulted in significant blunt force trauma to the chest. The bruising on the chest wall is indicative of this. The presence of chest pain, elevated troponins, and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are suggestive of myocardial damage or strain, possibly due to cardiac contusion or even rupture. The tachycardia could be due to pain, anxiety, or underlying cardiac damage. Given the circumstances and findings, the most likely diagnosis is myocardial contusion, a condition that results from blunt chest trauma and involves injury to the heart muscle.",Y,Cardiac Contusion,"Step 1: We first consider the prior probability. This patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision (MVC) and was an unrestrained driver. The probability of traumatic injury due to an MVC is quite high.

Step 2: The patient's echocardiogram only shows sinus tachycardia and physical exam reveals bruising over his chest wall. This fact does not tell us the specific nature of the injury but suggests the possibility of blunt chest trauma which increases the probability of a chest-related injury.

Step 3: The patient�s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is elevated. This is a classic finding in cases of cardiac tamponade, which further raises the probability.

Step 4: The troponin levels are elevated. Troponin is a protein that is released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a myocardial contusion or infarction. In the context of an MVC and the other symptoms, a myocardial contusion becomes more likely.

Step 5: The patient is also complaining of chest pain. In this context, this further supports a diagnosis of a cardiac injury due to blunt chest trauma, such as a myocardial contusion.

Combining all these findings, we can conclude that the most likely diagnosis is a myocardial contusion resulting from the motor vehicle collision.",Y

However, in the context of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, abnormal iron studies with high transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, the patient's joint condition is most likely secondary to hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet. This excess iron is then deposited in various organs, including the joints, leading to a condition that can mimic inflammatory arthritis.",Y,Hemochromatosis,"The differential for this patient includes: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, pseudogout, diabetes-related joint disease, and hemochromatosis. The patient has a history of diabetes, which could be related to osteoarthritis or diabetes-related joint disease, but these would not explain the high transferrin saturation and serum ferritin levels. Rheumatoid arthritis is usually associated with a positive rheumatoid factor or anti-CCP, and a symmetric pattern of involvement in small joints, which does not exactly match this patient's presentation. Gout and pseudogout typically do not affect metacarpophalangeal joints preferentially, and they are usually episodic rather than progressive. Hemochromatosis, a condition of iron overload, can cause a clinical syndrome of diabetes mellitus (bronze diabetes) and arthropathy, amongst other things. The high transferrin saturation and serum ferritin level are indicative of iron overload, suggesting hemochromatosis as the most likely diagnosis.",Y,Hemochromatosis,"This patient's clinical presentation with the findings of joint pain, particularly in the metacarpophalangeal joints, along with the laboratory findings of high transferrin saturation and high serum ferritin strongly suggests a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a condition characterized by increased intestinal absorption of dietary iron, which accumulates in the body. The excess iron deposits in various organs including the joints, liver, heart, and pancreas, causing damage and dysfunction. The symptoms and signs can vary, but may include arthritis, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, and skin pigmentation. The arthritis often affects the metacarpophalangeal joints, particularly the second and third. It is typically seen in middle-aged patients, which aligns with this patient's age. Furthermore, the increased transferrin saturation (>45%) and serum ferritin are indicative of iron overload, supporting the diagnosis of hemochromatosis.",Y,Hemochromatosis,"This patient's presentation suggests arthritis, but the specific type and etiology is given away by the laboratory findings. Transferrin saturation of 88% and a ferritin level of 1200 ng/mL are significantly elevated, suggesting iron overload. This is a hallmark of hemochromatosis, a condition where the body absorbs too much iron from the diet, leading to iron deposition in various tissues, including the joints, causing a specific type of arthritis often involving the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. Hemochromatosis can also cause diabetes, further supporting this diagnosis in the context of this patient's poorly controlled diabetes.",Y,Hemochromatosis,"This patient presents with joint pain and hand swelling, along with a transferrin saturation of 88% and a serum ferritin level of 1,200 ng/mL. The symptoms, along with the lab values, suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis.

Step 1: Prior probability
The prevalence of hemochromatosis in the general population is low, about 0.5%.

Step 2: Likelihood ratios
The presence of joint pain, especially in the metacarpophalangeal joints, and elevated transferrin saturation and ferritin levels are strongly suggestive of hemochromatosis. While not all patients with hemochromatosis present with these signs and symptoms, their presence significantly increases the likelihood of hemochromatosis. Therefore, these findings provide a strong positive likelihood ratio, suggesting that the posterior probability of hemochromatosis is now higher.

Step 3: Posterior probability
Given the patient's specific symptoms and the abnormal laboratory values, the probability that this patient has hemochromatosis is significantly greater than the prior probability of 0.5% for the general population. We might estimate it to be around 85-90% (the exact percentage would require specific calculations based on the likelihood ratios for the symptoms and lab findings).",Y

Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue, which normally lines the inside of the uterus, grows outside the uterus. The cyclic symptoms correspond to hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle, which affect not just the normal endometrial tissue but also the ectopic endometrial tissue, causing cyclic inflammation and pain. The exact pathogenesis of endometriosis is not clearly understood, but the most widely accepted theory is retrograde menstruation, where menstrual blood containing endometrial cells flows back through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvic cavity instead of out of the body. These endometrial cells then stick to the pelvic walls and surfaces of pelvic organs, where they grow and continue to thicken and bleed over the course of each menstrual cycle.",Y,Endometriosis,"The differential for this patient includes endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and uterine fibroids. PID typically presents with lower abdominal pain, abnormal vaginal discharge, and can lead to infertility, but does not align with her pain pattern or diarrhea. PCOS typically presents with irregular menses, hirsutism, obesity, and infertility, which also doesn't match her symptoms. Uterine fibroids usually cause heavy prolonged menstrual cycles, which she doesn't have. However, endometriosis, which is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, can cause cyclic pelvic pain and diarrhea as well as infertility due to inflammation and adhesions. It can cause pain even with normal pelvic exam and hysterosalpingogram, and it's more likely to be the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms.",Y,Endometrial tissue implantation,"This patient has been experiencing difficulty conceiving, along with chronic pelvic and back pain and painful diarrhea which typically are aggravated during her menstrual cycles. These symptoms are characteristic of endometriosis, a condition in which endometrial-like tissue is found outside the uterus. These ectopic tissues respond to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle and lead to cyclical symptoms. Furthermore, endometriosis is a common cause of infertility. Although her hysterosalpingogram was normal, this test primarily evaluates the uterus and fallopian tube patency but may not detect peritoneal or ovarian endometriosis.",Y,Endometriosis,"This patient's inability to conceive combined with cyclical pelvic and back pain as well as painful diarrhea suggests endometriosis, a condition where endometrial tissue is found outside of the uterus. The symptoms usually peak during menstruation when this ectopic endometrial tissue also undergoes cyclic hormonal changes. The pain is likely due to local inflammatory response and irritation of adjacent structures (like the bowel, causing diarrhea). The mechanism behind infertility in endometriosis is not entirely understood but could be due to physical obstruction, alteration of the local pelvic environment, or disruption of ovarian function. Despite the hysterosalpingogram showing no obstruction, it doesn't rule out endometriosis, as the disease can manifest microscopically.",Y,Ectopic endometrial tissue,"The prior probability of endometriosis in a woman with infertility is around 20-50%. The patient reports episodic pelvic and back pain along with painful diarrhea, which is characteristic of endometriosis, and increases the posterior probability to around 70%. Moreover, the timing of her pain suggests that it is associated with her menstrual cycle, which is also consistent with endometriosis, further increasing the posterior probability to around 90%. Normal hysterosalpingogram and physical examination don't rule out endometriosis as it often presents with normal findings on these tests. Given the strong fit of her symptoms with endometriosis, the posterior probability that she has endometriosis is very high. The underlying mechanism of her symptoms is likely to be the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus (ectopic endometrial tissue) which goes through the same hormonal changes as normal endometrial tissue, leading to inflammation, pain, and potentially infertility.",Y

She has severe facial lacerations, signs of respiratory distress, and low oxygen saturation. Physical examination suggests a lung issue on the left side (dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds), which along with the findings of a fractured second left rib and depression of the left mainstem bronchus on X-ray indicates trauma to the chest area. Furthermore, a widened mediastinum and deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right are classic signs of traumatic aortic injury, which is often seen in high-speed motor vehicle accidents due to the sudden deceleration. Thus, based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is aortic injury or rupture.",Y,Thoracic aortic rupture,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, pulmonary contusion, traumatic aortic rupture, or tracheobronchial injury. She is experiencing respiratory distress and has a decreased saturation on pulse oximetry which suggests significant pulmonary or cardiovascular compromise. Physical examination reveals dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, which could suggest a hemothorax or a collapsed lung (pneumothorax).

However, the crucial finding here is on the chest x-ray: depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. This combination of findings is strongly suggestive of a traumatic aortic rupture, which could occur due to the high impact of a motor vehicle collision. This injury often leads to mediastinal widening on chest x-ray due to blood in the mediastinum from the aortic rupture. A traumatic aortic rupture would also lead to respiratory distress and a low oxygen saturation as found in this patient.

While some of the other conditions on the differential could cause part of the picture, none of them would account for all of the findings, including the key x-ray results. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is a traumatic aortic rupture.",Y,Traumatic aortic rupture,"The clinical presentation of this patient suggests severe trauma as a result of a high-speed motor vehicle collision. Key findings include lethargy and incoherence (likely due to hypoxia and/or shock), respiratory distress, and a low oxygen saturation. The dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base suggest a hemothorax or pneumothorax, possibly due to a fractured second rib. The x-ray findings of depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum suggest displacement of thoracic structures, likely due to a traumatic aortic rupture or aortic dissection, which is a common life-threatening injury following blunt chest trauma.",Y,Traumatic aortic injury,"This patient's presentation and the findings on the chest X-ray are suggestive of traumatic aortic injury. The high-speed motor vehicle collision provided a mechanism for such an injury. Notably, the chest X-ray findings include a widened mediastinum and deviation of the nasogastric tube, which are indicative of possible aortic injury. The fractured rib also suggests significant thoracic trauma. Additionally, the lethargy and incoherence may be due to inadequate perfusion secondary to aortic rupture. Finally, the respiratory distress and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base could be the result of a hemothorax, which could occur if the aorta was ruptured and blood was leaking into the thoracic cavity. Thus, this patient most likely has a traumatic aortic injury.",Y,Traumatic aortic rupture,"The prior probability of traumatic aortic rupture, considering the general population, is relatively low. However, given that the woman was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, the probability increases. Additionally, her physical examination results suggest decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, potentially indicative of a hemothorax, which may be associated with aortic injury. This increases the probability of traumatic aortic rupture. The finding of a widened mediastinum on the chest x-ray is highly suggestive of aortic dissection or rupture, significantly increasing the likelihood of traumatic aortic rupture. The fracture of the left second rib and depression of the left mainstem bronchus can also be associated with major trauma to the thoracic cavity, further increasing the probability of traumatic aortic rupture. Given all these factors, it is very likely that the patient's symptoms and signs are due to traumatic aortic rupture.",Y
"A 2-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of yellowing of the skin and sclerae for 16 hours. He had previously been well. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery and weighed 3.1 kg (6 lb 13 oz). The mother has no medical insurance and did not receive prenatal care. The newborn's 4-year-old brother has sickle cell disease. Examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is mildly distended. The liver is palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen tip is palpated just below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Reticulocytes 9%
Leukocytes 9,100/mm3
Platelets 244,000/mm3
Maternal blood group 0, Rh-negative
Anti-Rh antibody titer positive
Fetal blood group B, Rh-negative
Serum
Bilirubin, total 11.3 mg/dL
Direct 0.3 mg/dL
What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""",Anti B antibodies,Hemolytic disease of the newborn,N,Hemolytic disease of the newborn.,N,Hemolytic disease of the newborn,N,Hemolytic disease of the newborn.,N,Hemolytic disease,N,,Hemolytic disease of the Newborn,"This newborn has hyperbilirubinemia, as evidenced by jaundice and a high total bilirubin level. Hyperbilirubinemia is commonly seen in newborns, but its etiology varies. The significant information in this case is the mother's Rh-negative blood type and the positive anti-Rh antibody titer. Despite the baby also being Rh-negative, the fact that the mother has anti-Rh antibodies implies a past sensitization event, likely due to the previous pregnancy with an Rh-positive child. These anti-Rh antibodies could have crossed the placenta during the current pregnancy and caused hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). Hemolysis would cause an increase in the production of bilirubin (as hemoglobin is broken down), leading to hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. This is further supported by the increased reticulocyte count in the baby's blood, as the baby's bone marrow attempts to compensate for the hemolysis by producing new red blood cells.",Y,ABO incompatibility,"The differential for this newborn includes physiological jaundice, neonatal sepsis, biliary atresia, Rh or ABO incompatibility, and hereditary spherocytosis. Physiological jaundice typically appears after the first 24 hours of life and peaks around day 3-4, while neonatal sepsis would likely present with additional systemic symptoms. Biliary atresia would present with jaundice persisting after two weeks of age and with direct bilirubin elevation. Hereditary spherocytosis is less likely given that the older sibling has sickle cell disease and not spherocytosis. Rh or ABO incompatibility is a strong possibility here given the positive anti-Rh antibody titer in the mother. However, the baby is Rh-negative, which contradicts the possibility of Rh incompatibility. The presence of jaundice, reticulocytosis, anemia, and the positive maternal Anti-Rh antibodies despite the baby being Rh negative could suggest ABO incompatibility where the mother's type O blood has anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Even though the newborn's Rh status does not contribute to the current condition, the blood type (B) can lead to an immune response due to maternal anti-B antibodies. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is ABO incompatibility.",Y,ABO incompatibility,"This newborn presents with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia (hemoglobin 11 g/dL), and high reticulocyte count (9%). The newborn's clinical picture and lab findings are indicative of hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), which arises due to an incompatibility between the maternal and fetal blood types. The positive maternal anti-Rh antibody titer and Rh-negative status of both mother and baby rule out Rh incompatibility as the cause of HDN. However, ABO incompatibility, especially when the mother is type O and the newborn is type A, B or AB, can cause a milder form of HDN, which typically presents within the first few days of life, as is seen in this case. The elevated total bilirubin (mostly unconjugated) is a result of the breakdown of excess hemoglobin due to hemolysis, while the high reticulocyte count reflects increased erythropoiesis in response to the anemia.",Y,ABO incompatibility,"The patient is a 2-day-old newborn presenting with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. However, the high level of total serum bilirubin (11.3 mg/dL), with primarily indirect bilirubin (unconjugated), and a high percentage of reticulocytes suggests hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), a condition in which there is an increased breakdown of red blood cells. This is supported by the mother's positive anti-Rh antibody titer, indicating the presence of antibodies that could attack fetal red blood cells. However, in this case, both the mother and the infant are Rh negative, thus Rh incompatibility is not the cause. But the mother is of blood group O and the newborn is of group B, suggesting ABO incompatibility, a common cause of mild to moderate HDN. Hence, the mother's anti-B antibodies are most likely responsible for the newborn's condition.",Y,Hemolytic disease of the Newborn,"The initial (prior) probability of this newborn having hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to Rh incompatibility is fairly low given that both the mother and baby are Rh-negative. However, we should still consider other forms of HDN and the steps to evaluate them.

Given the baby's brother has sickle cell disease, the posterior probability of a hemoglobinopathy causing increased hemolysis is higher. However, sickle cell disease does not typically present with symptoms in the neonatal period due to the protective effect of fetal hemoglobin. This keeps the likelihood of this being the cause relatively low.

Given the baby's high total bilirubin and low direct (conjugated) bilirubin levels, this is suggestive of an increased breakdown of red blood cells or impaired conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. This increases the likelihood of a hemolytic process.

The fact that the newborn has a high reticulocyte count (9%) is indicative of an increased rate of red blood cell destruction and replacement, which suggests a hemolytic process.

The baby's mother's blood group is O and the baby's blood group is B. This introduces the possibility of ABO incompatibility. Since group O mothers can have anti-A and anti-B antibodies, they can cause hemolytic disease in their infants if the infant has blood type A or B. This fact increases the posterior probability of ABO incompatibility being the cause of the baby's jaundice.

Given all the above, it's most likely that the cause of this newborn's jaundice is ABO incompatibility.",Y
"A 66-year-old male presents to his primary care physician to discuss his increasing shortness of breathover the last 3 months. He notes that this is particularly obvious when he is mowing his lawn or climbing the stairs in his home. His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is well-controlled with lisinopril. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.6 C, HR 88, BP 136/58, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Physical examination is significant for an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation. In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. What diagnoses is most likely in this patient?",Aortic regurgitation,Aortic regurgitation,Y,Congestive heart failure.,N,Aortic stenosis,N,Aortic stenosis,N,Aortic regurgitation,Y,,Aortic regurgitation,"This patient presents with shortness of breath during exertion (like mowing the lawn or climbing stairs) which is suggestive of a cardiovascular condition causing inadequate oxygen supply. His physical examination reveals multiple types of murmurs: an early diastolic blowing decrescendo murmur, a midsystolic murmur, a late diastolic rumbling murmur, and an S3 heart sound. The combination of these murmurs and the presence of bounding pulses are highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation. The early diastolic blowing decrescendo murmur is a classic finding in aortic regurgitation, and the presence of bounding pulses is due to the increased stroke volume caused by the backflow of blood into the left ventricle during diastole. The midsystolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border could be due to the increased flow across the aortic valve during systole (due to the increased volume in the left ventricle), or potentially from an associated condition such as aortic stenosis. The late diastolic rumbling murmur and the S3 heart sound suggest left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure, likely secondary to the chronic volume overload from the aortic regurgitation.",Y,Aortic regurgitation,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. The described early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur best heard at the left sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border could suggest aortic stenosis but it is usually heard best at the second intercostal space on the right sternal border. The late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex is suggestive of mitral stenosis. The S3 heart sound could be indicative of heart failure or volume overload conditions like mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation. The finding of bounding pulses is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. Therefore, the combination of findings such as the early diastolic decrescendo murmur, the bounding pulses, and the S3 heart sound makes aortic regurgitation the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",Y,Aortic regurgitation and mitral stenosis,"This patient presents with symptoms of exertional dyspnea (shortness of breath during activities such as mowing the lawn or climbing stairs), which may indicate cardiac disease. Upon physical examination, the doctor hears several murmurs and an S3 heart sound, and palpates bounding pulses, all of which are indicative of specific types of heart conditions.

The early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. In addition, bounding pulses (or ""water hammer"" pulses) are a classic sign of aortic regurgitation.

The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border could be due to aortic stenosis, which often coexists with aortic regurgitation in conditions such as a bicuspid aortic valve. However, the most definitive clue here is the late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex. This is suggestive of mitral stenosis.

Finally, the S3 heart sound, in an adult, is often associated with heart failure, which could be a result of the valvular diseases.

Therefore, this patient likely has a combination of aortic regurgitation, possibly aortic stenosis, and mitral stenosis, leading to symptoms of heart failure.",Y,Aortic regurgitation and mitral stenosis,"This patient presents with several murmurs that can be indicative of multiple cardiovascular pathologies. The presence of an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border is suggestive of aortic regurgitation. This finding is further supported by the presence of bounding pulses (a.k.a. Corrigan's pulses), a sign associated with aortic regurgitation.

The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border could indicate aortic stenosis or pulmonary stenosis. However, the absence of other symptoms typical of these conditions makes them less likely.

The late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex is characteristic of mitral stenosis, often caused by rheumatic heart disease or other forms of mitral valve degeneration.

The presence of an S3 heart sound can be normal in young and fit individuals, but in older adults it can be indicative of heart failure, likely from volume overload. In this case, it might be due to a combination of aortic regurgitation and mitral stenosis, which both can lead to volume overload of the left ventricle.

Taken together, these findings suggest a combination of aortic regurgitation and mitral stenosis as the most likely diagnoses in this patient. Other possibilities such as aortic stenosis or pulmonary stenosis would likely present with other signs or symptoms not described here. Therefore, the diagnosis that best fits this patient's presentation is a combination of aortic regurgitation and mitral stenosis.",Y,"Multiple valvular diseases, heart failure","The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath during physical activities, also known as exertional dyspnea, indicate some form of cardiovascular issue. The nature of the cardiac murmurs and the presence of bounding pulses offer additional clues.

The prior probability of having aortic regurgitation, for example, in a general population over 60 years of age, might be around 4%. The presence of an early diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border (which is characteristic of aortic regurgitation) increases this probability to around 30%. The finding of bounding pulses, another sign of aortic regurgitation due to an increase in stroke volume, could increase the probability further, say to about 60%.

The presence of a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex are suggestive of additional valve issues - potentially aortic stenosis and mitral stenosis, respectively.

However, the presence of an S3 heart sound, often associated with heart failure, suggests that these valve problems have led to the failure of the heart to pump blood efficiently.

The combined effect of these three murmurs and the S3 heart sound increases the probability of a complex cardiovascular issue involving valve disorders and subsequent heart failure, say to around 80%.

This patient most likely has multiple valvular heart diseases (aortic regurgitation, potentially aortic and/or mitral stenosis) leading to heart failure.",Y
"A 28-year-old woman presents following a suicide attempt 2 days ago. She says that her attempt was a result of a fight with her boyfriend and that she slit her wrists in an attempt to keep him from breaking up with her. In the past, she has had many turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life. Her family members describe her as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people’s feelings. Since she was admitted to the hospital, she has spit at several staff members and alternated between sobbing and anger. She has no significant past medical history.

Furthermore, she has demonstrated a pattern of self-harming behavior as a reaction to perceived abandonment (e.g., her boyfriend breaking up with her). These are hallmark symptoms of borderline personality disorder.",Y,Borderline personality disorder,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Borderline Personality Disorder, Bipolar disorder, Major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation, and Histrionic personality disorder.

Based on the details given, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) seems most likely. BPD is often characterized by unstable and intense interpersonal relationships, impulsivity, and manipulative behaviors � all evident in this case. The patient has a history of turbulent relationships and impulsive behavior, both hallmarks of BPD. Additionally, the description of her frequent mood swings and manipulative actions (such as self-harm in response to a potential breakup and spitting at staff members) aligns with the diagnostic criteria for BPD.

Bipolar disorder could also potentially explain her mood swings, but the absence of information regarding episodes of mania or hypomania makes this less likely. Major depressive disorder is unlikely as the patient's actions seem to be more reactive and manipulative, rather than indicative of a pervasive low mood or anhedonia. Histrionic personality disorder could account for some of her attention-seeking behaviors, but it lacks the self-harm and intense fear of abandonment seen in BPD.

Therefore, this patient most likely has Borderline Personality Disorder.",Y,Borderline personality disorder,"The patient exhibits impulsive behaviors, turbulent relationships, and manipulative actions, which are often associated with borderline personality disorder. Self-harm and suicide attempts are also common symptoms.

Her impulsive behavior, turbulent relationships, emotional instability, and self-harming behavior (i.e., wrist slitting as an extreme reaction to a potential breakup) are all classic symptoms of BPD. Furthermore, patients with BPD often show alternating mood states, and can exhibit manipulative behaviors and anger directed towards others, as seen in this patient's interactions with the hospital staff. Therefore, given these observations, the most likely diagnosis is Borderline Personality Disorder.",Y,Borderline personality disorder,"The prior probability of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) in a general population is about 1.6%. Given the patient's history of turbulent relationships, the probability of BPD increases to about 20%. The fact that the patient made a suicide attempt following a fight with her boyfriend, which can be seen as an impulsive action and an extreme response to fear of abandonment, increases the probability further to about 40%. Her described pattern of manipulating others' emotions further supports the likelihood of BPD, raising the probability to about 60%. Lastly, her volatile emotional states at the hospital (alternating between sobbing and anger) increase the posterior probability to about 80%.

He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person.

He also shows signs of infection (fever, leukocytosis, and high neutrophil count in ascitic fluid). The combination of these findings suggests spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a bacterial infection of the ascitic fluid without an evident intra-abdominal, surgically treatable source. It is a common and potentially life-threatening complication in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. SBP is usually suspected when a patient with ascites becomes symptomatic, as this patient has, with signs of systemic infection. The diagnosis is confirmed by a neutrophil count > 250 cells/mm3 in the ascitic fluid, as shown by this patient's ascitic fluid analysis.",Y,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes complications of chronic liver disease such as hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatic hydrothorax. His long-term untreated hepatitis C and signs of chronic liver disease (scleral icterus, spider angiomas, ascites) make these likely possibilities. Additionally, his confusion and the altered mental status (oriented only to person) could be due to hepatic encephalopathy but the presence of an infection can also cause confusion, especially in patients with chronic liver disease. The absence of bowel sounds and diffuse abdominal tenderness along with the high white blood cell count in the ascitic fluid analysis (>250/mm3 with 60% neutrophils) suggest an infection in the ascitic fluid, most likely spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common and potentially fatal infection in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Given these symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings, the most likely explanation for this patient's condition is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.",Y,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"This patient's history of hepatitis C, presentation with ascites, confusion (likely hepatic encephalopathy), fever, and elevated neutrophils in the ascitic fluid strongly suggest Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP). SBP is a bacterial infection in the peritoneal cavity and is most common in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. Symptoms may be subtle, but can include fever, abdominal pain, change in mental status, and signs of peritoneal inflammation. The diagnosis is confirmed by a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count > 250 cells/mm_ in ascites fluid. This patient has a PMN count of 1900/mm_ in the ascitic fluid which is diagnostic for SBP. His underlying liver disease (indicated by low albumin and elevated bilirubin) and history of hepatitis C are risk factors for developing SBP. Moreover, his confusion can be explained by hepatic encephalopathy, which often accompanies severe liver disease.",Y,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), a common and potentially lethal complication of cirrhosis and ascites. SBP typically presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and altered mental status (in this case, confusion). It may present without abdominal pain or tenderness, particularly in patients with cirrhosis.

SBP is diagnosed by paracentesis with ascitic fluid analysis showing a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count of greater than 250/mm^3. In this case, the patient's ascitic fluid analysis reveals a leukocyte count of 1900/mm^3 with 60% neutrophils, suggestive of SBP. The patient's presentation is further complicated by hepatic encephalopathy, suggested by confusion and hand tremors, likely due to his underlying hepatitis C and cirrhosis.

Hence, based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely explanation for his condition is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.",Y,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.,"This patient presents with confusion, fever, abdominal pain, and ascites in the setting of known hepatitis C infection and alcohol abuse, suggesting a diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Step 1: Prior probability
The prior probability of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites is about 15%.

Step 2: Symptoms evidence
He presents with fever (38.3°C or 100.9°F) and abdominal pain, both common symptoms in SBP. This raises the posterior probability to 30%.

Step 3: Confusion evidence
Confusion, which can be due to hepatic encephalopathy, is commonly exacerbated in patients with SBP due to additional systemic inflammatory response. This could further raise the probability to 50%.

Step 4: Lab findings evidence
Lab findings show elevated leukocyte count (13,900/mm3) and neutrophil-dominant leukocytosis in the ascitic fluid (>250/mm3), which is diagnostic of SBP. This pushes the posterior probability close to 95%.

Therefore, given the patient's presentation, the most likely explanation for these findings is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.",Y
"A 43-year-old woman presents with complaints of retrosternal burning associated with eating. It has persisted for the past several years but has been getting worse. Her past medical history is unknown and this is her first time seeing a doctor. She states she is otherwise healthy and review of systems is notable for episodic hand pain that is worse in the winter as well as a chronic and severe cough with dyspnea which she attributes to her smoking. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 174/104 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a young appearing woman with coarse breath sounds. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are ordered and currently pending. What is the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint?",Esophageal fibrosis,GERD,N,GERD,N,GERD,N,GERD,Y,GERD,N,,Acid reflux into the esophagus.,"The woman's chief complaint is retrosternal burning associated with eating, a classic symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is due to the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus, which is often caused by the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter or increased intra-abdominal pressure. Other possible contributing factors to GERD include her chronic smoking habit which can cause weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter and hence contribute to reflux. Her hypertension could also indirectly suggest the presence of metabolic syndrome which has been associated with GERD. Therefore, the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint (retrosternal burning) can be attributed to the reflux of stomach acid into the esophagus.",Y,Lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction,"The patient presents with retrosternal burning associated with eating, which is suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is due to a malfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which allows gastric acid to reflux into the esophagus. This is the most likely explanation for her chief complaint. However, other symptoms mentioned such as chronic and severe cough, dyspnea, high blood pressure, and coarse breath sounds could suggest other concurrent conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or hypertension, common in smokers. The hand pain could be due to Raynaud's phenomenon, which can also be more common in smokers. These are all separate conditions with distinct pathophysiologies, but GERD is the most likely explanation for her primary complaint of retrosternal burning with eating.",Y,Lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction,"This patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning (heartburn) that worsens with eating, in addition to her reported history of severe cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath), point to the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a condition where the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to close properly, which allows gastric acid to flow back (reflux) into the esophagus from the stomach. This reflux can cause the characteristic burning sensation (heartburn), coughing, and difficulty breathing. The patient's symptoms are worsened with eating because this increases the amount of stomach acid that can reflux into the esophagus.

Furthermore, the elevated blood pressure and the chronic hand pain that worsens in winter could indicate a co-existing condition such as Raynaud's disease, a condition that affects blood flow to the extremities, particularly the fingers, in response to cold or stress. Chronic smoking is also known to cause or exacerbate both these conditions - GERD by increasing stomach acid production and weakening the LES, and Raynaud's disease by causing vasoconstriction.",Y,Systemic sclerosis-induced GERD,"The patient presents with retrosternal burning that is worse with eating, suggesting gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is caused by the lower esophageal sphincter's inability to close properly, which allows acidic stomach contents to backflow into the esophagus causing the characteristic burning sensation. The high blood pressure, episodic hand pain worse in winter (suggestive of Raynaud's phenomenon), and coarse breath sounds (suggestive of pulmonary fibrosis) might indicate systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma. This autoimmune connective tissue disorder affects many body parts, including the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs, and can weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, resulting in GERD. The chronic cough and dyspnea could be attributed to her smoking history, possibly leading to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but may also be connected to interstitial lung disease, which is a complication of scleroderma. Therefore, the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint likely involves an autoimmune-mediated weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter due to systemic sclerosis, resulting in GERD.",Y,Gastroesophageal reflux disease.,"The patient presents with a chief complaint of retrosternal burning associated with eating, which is a classic presentation of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The Bayesian reasoning would be as follows:

The prior probability of GERD in the general population is about 20%. This is our starting point. The posterior probability will be adjusted based on the information provided in the clinical scenario.

The association of the retrosternal burning with eating is a classic symptom of GERD, increasing the probability to around 60%.

The patient has been experiencing the symptoms for several years, which is common in chronic GERD, increasing the probability to around 70%.

The patient's lifestyle includes smoking, which is known to worsen GERD by decreasing lower esophageal sphincter pressure and increasing acid secretion. This would further increase the probability of GERD to around 80%.

Moreover, there's no mention of any factors that would decrease the probability of GERD, such as effective use of antacids or proton pump inhibitors.

Therefore, considering the Bayesian inference, the most likely pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint would be the backward flow of stomach acid into the esophagus due to a dysfunctional lower esophageal sphincter, causing the characteristic burning sensation of GERD.",Y

What is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?",Metformin,Osmotic diarrhea,N,Dehydration,N,Diabetic ketoacidosis,N,Dehydration,N,Hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis,N,,Diabetic Ketoacidosis,"The patient's lab results show a low bicarbonate level (HCO3-) of 11 mEq/L. This is significantly below the normal range of 22-28 mEq/L, indicating a primary metabolic acidosis. In metabolic acidosis, the body either produces too much acid, loses too much bicarbonate, or a combination of both.

The anion gap should also be calculated in cases of metabolic acidosis to help determine the cause. The anion gap is the difference between primary measured cations (sodium Na+) and anions (chloride Cl- and bicarbonate HCO3-), which in this case is 141 - (99 + 11) = 31 mEq/L. A high anion gap (>12 mEq/L) is seen in conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, renal failure, and ingestion of toxins such as methanol or ethylene glycol.

This patient has a known history of diabetes and the lab results reveal an elevated glucose level (177 mg/dL) and an increased creatinine level (3.1 mg/dL), suggesting renal impairment. The most probable cause of metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap in this patient is therefore diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. Alternatively, it could also be due to chronic kidney disease, as indicated by the elevated creatinine, which may result in metabolic acidosis due to reduced excretion of acid and impaired bicarbonate regeneration.",N,Chronic kidney disease,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's laboratory derangements includes metabolic acidosis due to either increased acid production, decreased acid secretion, or loss of bicarbonate. The causes of metabolic acidosis could be diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, kidney disease, medications, or gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss.

The normal anion gap is calculated as [Na+] - ([Cl-] + [HCO3-]) which equals 141 - (99 + 11) = 31 mEq/L. Given that the normal anion gap is 8-16 mEq/L, this patient's anion gap is elevated, indicating an anion gap metabolic acidosis. This narrows the possible causes to conditions that cause increased acid production or decreased acid secretion.

The patient's history of diabetic nephropathy and his creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL (indicating chronic kidney disease) suggests that he may have impaired renal acid excretion. Diabetic nephropathy can cause tubular dysfunction, leading to decreased ammonium excretion and resultant metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, the patient's BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) is elevated at 20 mg/dL which is also common in kidney diseases.

Additionally, the patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 177 mg/dL, but this is not sufficiently high to suggest diabetic ketoacidosis, which usually presents with much higher glucose levels and more severe symptoms.

Therefore, based on the patient's history of diabetic nephropathy, his current creatinine level, the high anion gap, and the low bicarbonate level, the most likely cause of this patient's laboratory derangements is metabolic acidosis due to chronic kidney disease.",N,Diabetic Ketoacidosis,"The patient's lab results show a bicarbonate level of 11 mEq/L, which is significantly lower than the normal range (22-28 mEq/L). This indicates a metabolic acidosis. Furthermore, his anion gap is calculated as follows: Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-) = 141 - (99 + 11) = 31 mEq/L. The normal anion gap is usually around 8-12 mEq/L, indicating that this patient has a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. The elevated creatinine indicates renal dysfunction, which is consistent with his history of diabetic nephropathy. In the setting of diabetic nephropathy and a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, the most likely etiology is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite the fact that his glucose levels are not extremely high, ""euglycemic DKA"" can occur and should not be ruled out simply due to glucose levels within a near-normal range.",N,Chronic kidney disease,"This patient's laboratory values reveal a low HCO3- level, indicative of a metabolic acidosis. Given the history of diabetic nephropathy and elevated creatinine, this suggests chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD results in decreased renal excretion of acid, leading to metabolic acidosis. The kidney disease can also cause impaired glucose control, which is shown by the high glucose level. Moreover, CKD leads to a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), resulting in the accumulation of urea in the blood (indicated by increased BUN), and creatinine, a waste product that kidneys normally eliminate.",N,Renal tubular acidosis,"This patient's bicarbonate level is significantly lower than normal, suggesting a metabolic acidosis. A basic step-by-step Bayesian inference approach to determine the cause of this patient's acid-base disturbance could be as follows:

The prior probability of having metabolic acidosis in a 66-year-old man with a history of diabetic nephropathy is around 20%.
Given the patient's history of diabetes and the high BUN and creatinine levels (suggesting possible renal dysfunction), the posterior probability of a renal cause for the metabolic acidosis (e.g. renal tubular acidosis or chronic kidney disease) goes up to around 40%.
His recent presentation with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain), and the subsequent improvement of these symptoms following bowel movements, suggests a possible gastrointestinal cause. This could increase the probability of metabolic acidosis due to gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss (e.g., from diarrhea) to 60%.
However, his laboratory results do not suggest an accompanying electrolyte loss that would be expected with significant diarrhea, and the CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. This brings down the probability of a gastrointestinal cause for the metabolic acidosis.
Finally, considering the patient's history of morbid obesity, we need to consider the possibility of a metabolic acidosis due to increased production of organic acids (such as lactic acid or ketones). However, the normal glucose level makes diabetic ketoacidosis unlikely, while his not being in acute distress or having any other signs of tissue hypoperfusion makes lactic acidosis unlikely.
Therefore, based on Bayesian inference, the most likely cause of this patient's metabolic acidosis is chronic kidney disease or renal tubular acidosis due to his history of diabetic nephropathy.",N
"A 28-year-old gravida 1 at 32 weeks gestation is evaluated for an abnormal ultrasound that showed fetal microcephaly. Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. What is the most likely etiologic agent?",Zika virus,Zika virus,Y,Zika virus,Y,Zika virus,Y,Zika virus,Y,Zika virus,Y,,Zika virus,"This patient's history of travel to Brazil, which is known to have cases of Zika virus, along with symptoms of fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and a maculopapular rash in the first trimester, are highly suggestive of a Zika virus infection. The finding of microcephaly in her baby further supports this diagnosis, as Zika virus infection in pregnancy is known to cause severe birth defects, including microcephaly. She did not use any mosquito repellents, increasing her risk of mosquito-borne diseases. The negative IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis rule out another common infectious cause of fetal microcephaly.",Y,Zika virus,"The differential for the etiologic agents in this case could include: Toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), syphilis, and Zika virus. Each of these agents can cause congenital infections leading to fetal microcephaly. However, the patient's negative IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis exclude toxoplasmosis as a possibility. Her symptoms of fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, combined with recent travel to Brazil (a region known for Zika virus transmission), point to a likely Zika virus infection. Additionally, she mentioned not using mosquito repellants and spending evenings hiking, which increases her exposure to mosquitos, the main vectors of Zika virus. The other agents in the differential (rubella, CMV, HSV, syphilis) do not align as closely with her clinical presentation and recent travel history.",Y,Zika virus,"This pregnant woman had a febrile illness characterized by headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash during the first trimester of pregnancy after a trip to Brazil, where Zika virus is endemic. The detection of fetal microcephaly on ultrasound is an important clue. Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious damage to the central nervous system of the fetus, including microcephaly. Therefore, the most likely etiological agent is the Zika virus.",Y,Zika virus,"This patient's symptoms of fevers, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash during the first trimester of her pregnancy, combined with her history of traveling in Brazil without mosquito repellent, strongly suggest infection with Zika virus. Zika virus is a flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes. It is endemic in parts of Brazil and other tropical regions. Zika virus can cross the placenta and cause congenital Zika syndrome, which is characterized by severe microcephaly, decreased brain tissue with a specific pattern of brain damage, damage to the back of the eye, joints with limited range of motion, and too much muscle tone restricting body movement soon after birth. Negative IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis rule out this etiology.",Y,Zika virus,"The prior probability of Zika virus infection given the context of Brazil travel and evening outdoor activity (with mosquitoes) is already quite high, let's say 40%. The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash are typical for Zika virus infection, which increases the posterior probability to 70%. Given the ultrasound finding of fetal microcephaly, which has been associated with Zika virus infection in pregnant women, the probability increases further to 90%. Negative IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis (which could also potentially cause fetal microcephaly) essentially rule out that infection, which increases the posterior probability of Zika virus to nearly 100%.",Y
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. What is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?",Decreased acetylcholine release,Botulism,Y,Food poisoning.,N,Botulism,Y,Food poisoning,N,Botulism,Y,,Botulinum toxin-induced paralysis,"This patient has signs of gastrointestinal illness (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) following a picnic where foodborne illness is a common occurrence, particularly when foods are left out for prolonged periods of time, and has confirmed another friend is also experiencing similar symptoms. This strongly suggests food poisoning. The onset of neurological symptoms, particularly those involving the eye muscles, point to a specific type of food poisoning, namely botulism, which is known for causing these symptoms. Botulism is caused by the toxin produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. The patient's blurred vision, double vision, and the finding of fixed pupillary dilation and difficulty depressing both eyes are characteristic of the paralysis caused by the botulinum toxin, which blocks acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, preventing muscle contractions.",Y,Botulinum toxin blockade,"The differential for this patient includes conditions like stroke, myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr� syndrome, and food-borne illness. The sudden onset of symptoms and his recent exposure to a picnic where he ate food made by someone else, in combination with a friend with similar symptoms, suggest a food-borne illness. The specific symptoms of blurry vision, double vision, fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes are typical of botulism, which is a foodborne illness caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The bacteria produces a toxin that blocks the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, which in turn causes symptoms related to muscular paralysis such as those experienced by this patient.",Y,Botulinum toxin inhibition,"This patient's sudden onset of blurry vision, diplopia (double vision), fixed pupillary dilation, difficulty depressing eyes, and gastrointestinal symptoms after attending a picnic suggest foodborne illness. These symptoms, particularly the neurological ones, are suggestive of botulism, a disease caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. The bacteria or its spores can be present in improperly canned or preserved foods, such as home-made pickles. When ingested, the botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in the symptoms seen in this patient, which include both cranial nerve deficits and autonomic symptoms. His friend having similar symptoms further supports a diagnosis of foodborne botulism.",Y,Botulism toxin-induced acetylcholine release inhibition,"This patient's presentation of sudden blurry vision, double vision, fixed pupillary dilation, difficulty depressing eyes (ophthalmoplegia), and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea) following a picnic are highly suggestive of botulism. Botulism is caused by the ingestion of the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. The foods implicated often are home-canned, fermented, or preserved, such as the pickles mentioned by the patient. The botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in muscle weakness, including the muscles controlling eye movements, and autonomic dysfunction. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common early symptoms due to the involvement of the autonomic nervous system.",Y,Botulinum toxin-induced paralysis.,"Start with the prior knowledge that the patient ate at a picnic and is suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms suggest foodborne illness, which has a high prior probability after consuming food in a picnic setting.
The patient has sudden onset blurry vision, diplopia (seeing double), and fixed dilated pupils, which are characteristic symptoms of botulism, a type of foodborne illness caused by ingestion of the botulinum toxin in contaminated food. This would increase our posterior probability of botulism.
Additionally, the difficulty in depressing both eyes indicates a dysfunction in cranial nerve IV, which is responsible for downward gaze, further supporting botulism as this toxin causes paralysis by inhibiting acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and symptoms like ophthalmoplegia (eye muscle weakness).
Another critical piece of information is that the patient's friend who also attended the picnic is experiencing similar symptoms. This further increases the probability of a common source foodborne illness like botulism.
Therefore, the most likely pathogenesis of this patient's presentation is botulinum toxin-induced paralysis caused by the ingestion of contaminated food at the picnic.",Y
"A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:

The fact that the infant's stools have become pale indicates a decrease in bilirubin reaching the gastrointestinal tract, which suggests a post-hepatic source of jaundice, or obstructive jaundice. When the issue is post-hepatic, the liver is effectively conjugating bilirubin, but it's not able to excrete it properly, leading to an increase in direct (conjugated) bilirubin. Furthermore, the palpable liver suggests hepatomegaly, another hint towards a liver disease. Given the patient's age and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is biliary atresia, a condition in which inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts lead to their obliteration, causing cholestasis.",Y,Biliary Atresia,"This neonate presents with jaundice, scleral icterus, direct hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated liver enzymes (especially alkaline phosphatase and _-glutamyl transferase), suggesting a hepatobiliary disease. The differential diagnosis includes: neonatal hepatitis, biliary atresia, choledochal cyst, and inborn errors of metabolism.

The direct hyperbilirubinemia and liver findings rule out breast milk jaundice which is typically associated with indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Neonatal hepatitis usually manifests with coagulopathy and metabolic abnormalities, which are not present here.

Inborn errors of metabolism usually present with more systemic symptoms and failure to thrive, which is not the case here. Choledochal cysts often present with an abdominal mass, which is also not reported here.

Biliary atresia, on the other hand, is characterized by the onset of jaundice after the first 2 weeks of life, pale or ""acholic"" stools (due to lack of bilirubin reaching the gut), hepatomegaly, and direct hyperbilirubinemia, all of which align with this patient's presentation. Therefore, biliary atresia is the most likely diagnosis.",Y,Biliary Atresia,"This newborn presents with symptoms of jaundice, scleral icterus, pale stools, and a liver palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin, which are all indicative of a liver or bile duct issue. The lab results confirm this suspicion as they demonstrate high levels of total and direct (conjugated) bilirubin, as well as markedly increased alkaline phosphatase and _-glutamyl transferase levels, which are typical of cholestatic diseases. Mild elevations in AST and ALT are indicative of some liver injury. The age of the patient and the symptoms described are most consistent with biliary atresia, which is a severe liver disorder in infants that occurs when the bile ducts become inflamed and blocked, leading to a buildup of bile in the liver. It can cause damage to the liver, jaundice, and other complications.",Y,Biliary Atresia,"The history provided indicates a neonate with progressive jaundice, scleral icterus, and pale stools, which suggests cholestasis. Cholestasis is the decrease in bile flow, and in infants, it is often due to biliary atresia. The findings of a direct (conjugated) hyperbilirubinemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase further support biliary obstruction. Additionally, the palpable liver could be indicative of hepatomegaly, another common finding in biliary atresia. Biliary atresia is a severe liver disorder that occurs shortly after birth when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not have normal openings. With biliary atresia, bile becomes trapped, accumulates, and causes damage to the liver, resulting in scarring, loss of liver tissue, and cirrhosis.",Y,Biliary Atresia,"We start with a prior probability for a few conditions that could cause jaundice in a 4-week-old newborn: neonatal hepatitis, biliary atresia, breast milk jaundice, and physiological jaundice.

Neonatal hepatitis: This is an inflammation of the liver that occurs only in infants. The prior probability is around 10%. The bilirubin levels are increased with a dominance of direct bilirubin, the liver enzymes are mildly elevated, and there is hepatomegaly. These findings could suggest neonatal hepatitis. However, the alkaline phosphatase levels are extremely high, which is not typical for neonatal hepatitis. This decreases the posterior probability to about 5%.
Biliary atresia: This condition, which blocks the bile ducts, has a prior probability of about 20%. The symptom of pale stools is characteristic of biliary atresia because it indicates a lack of bilirubin reaching the gut. Also, the high direct bilirubin and especially high alkaline phosphatase are more typical for biliary atresia. Given these findings, we increase the posterior probability to around 70%.
Breast milk jaundice: The prior probability of this condition, which can cause mild jaundice in newborns, is around 30%. However, the symptoms have persisted and even worsened after stopping breastfeeding, which argues against breast milk jaundice, decreasing its posterior probability to nearly 0%.
Physiological jaundice: This is a common form of jaundice in the first week of life, with a prior probability of around 40%. However, it usually resolves by the end of the first week, and the bilirubin levels are much too high for this diagnosis. This reduces the posterior probability to almost 0%.
Given these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is biliary atresia.",Y

This symptomatology is typically caused by peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is a condition characterized by atherosclerotic blockages in the arteries supplying the legs. The patient's risk factors for PAD, including his advanced age, history of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension, make this condition likely. Furthermore, weak lower extremity and femoral pulses on physical examination further support this diagnosis. Erectile dysfunction in this case could be due to insufficient blood supply to the penis, as the internal pudendal arteries that supply the penis could also be affected by atherosclerosis.",N,Athersclerosis,"The differential for this patient includes: vascular insufficiency (atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis), neurogenic erectile dysfunction, psychogenic erectile dysfunction, hormonal (endocrine) causes, drug-induced erectile dysfunction, and lifestyle factors.

This patient's erectile dysfunction, lack of erections at night or in the morning, weak lower extremity and femoral pulses, as well as his history of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes (all risk factors for atherosclerosis), strongly suggest a vascular etiology. The deep, burning buttock and hip pain during walking, relieved by rest, sounds like it could be claudication, a classic symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is a form of atherosclerosis. Thus, it's most likely this patient's erectile dysfunction and other symptoms are due to vascular insufficiency caused by atherosclerosis.",Y,Peripheral artery disease,"The patient's erectile dysfunction, lower extremity pain that is relieved by rest (also known as claudication), weak lower extremity and femoral pulses, and a significant smoking history all point to peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is a common complication of atherosclerosis, in which plaque builds up in the arteries, reducing blood flow to the limbs. Reduced arterial blood flow can lead to claudication and erectile dysfunction, as the penis also relies on adequate blood flow to achieve an erection.

Moreover, the memory loss and difficulty with language (word finding difficulty) and attentiveness are also signs of cognitive decline. These symptoms are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia, which is a common cause of dementia that occurs at a younger age (typically 40s and early 60s).

Frontotemporal dementia often initially manifests as changes in personality and behavior, which can seem out of character for the individual. His difficulty with word finding and attention further increases the probability to 50%. These are signs of language and cognitive impairment, which are common in FTD. The absence of other significant physical signs or symptoms (the patient's vital signs are mostly normal), coupled with the gradual progression over months, further increases the probability to 70%.

Current medications include amitriptyline and diphenhydramine. The patient does not respond to questions and repeatedly says, """"The government is following me everywhere."""" His temperature is 37.9°C (100.2°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 160/89 mm Hg. He is diaphoretic. He is not oriented to place or time. Neurologic examination shows dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds. After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?""",Synthetic cathinone intoxication,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Ethanol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,,Serotonin Syndrome,"The patient presents with agitation, hallucinations, dilated pupils, hyperreflexia, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are characteristic of a syndrome known as serotonin syndrome, which is often associated with the use of serotonergic drugs. This patient is currently taking amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant known to increase serotonin levels. The presence of ethyl glucuronide in urine indicates recent alcohol use; combining alcohol with amitriptyline could potentially exacerbate its effects or cause an adverse reaction. Therefore, it is most likely that this patient's symptoms are due to serotonin syndrome precipitated by the combination of his medication and recent alcohol consumption.",N,Anticholinergic toxicity.,"This patient's differential includes alcohol intoxication, substance abuse (stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines, hallucinogens such as LSD, synthetic cannabinoids), acute psychosis, and anticholinergic toxicity. Key features of this patient's presentation include altered mental status with delirium (not oriented to place or time, bizarre behavior), vital sign abnormalities (hypertension, tachycardia), and physical signs such as dilated pupils, hyperreflexia, and diaphoresis. The positive urine toxicology screen for ethyl glucuronide suggests recent alcohol consumption but does not explain the entirety of his presentation. The medications he is taking, amitriptyline and diphenhydramine, are both anticholinergics. Taken in high doses, these can cause anticholinergic toxicity which fits with his dilated pupils, delirium, hyperreflexia, and hypertension. Hence, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is anticholinergic toxicity.",N,Anticholinergic toxidrome,"The patient is presenting with unusual behavior, agitation, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, and dilated pupils. His history of depression, use of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant), and recent addition of diphenhydramine (an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties) suggest he is experiencing an anticholinergic toxidrome, which can be caused by the combination of these medications. The urinary ethyl glucuronide is a biomarker of recent alcohol consumption but does not explain his symptoms. His symptoms of agitation, dilated pupils, and hyperreflexia are not typically associated with alcohol intoxication. Therefore, it is most likely that his symptoms are due to the anticholinergic effects of his medications.",N,Anticholinergic intoxication,"This patient's presentation of hallucinations, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, and autonomic hyperactivity (high blood pressure, increased heart rate, dilated pupils, and sweating) along with his history of use of amitriptyline, an antidepressant with anticholinergic properties, suggests anticholinergic intoxication. The presence of ethyl glucuronide in his urine indicates recent alcohol consumption, which may have potentiated the anticholinergic effects. His ingestion of diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic effects, for his allergies may have also contributed. Thus, this patient likely overdosed on drugs with anticholinergic effects.",N,Stimulant drug intoxication,"First, we should establish a prior hypothesis. Based on the patient's symptoms - such as paranoia, agitation, dilated pupils, and diaphoresis - we could hypothesize that he has a drug-induced psychosis or acute intoxication.

The patient's symptoms aren't likely due to his pre-existing conditions - major depressive disorder and seasonal allergies - or his known medications - amitriptyline and diphenhydramine - so these details don't change the likelihood of our hypothesis. The history of alcohol use and positive urine toxicology for ethyl glucuronide, however, suggest that the patient might have used substances besides alcohol.

The patient's signs of sympathetic nervous system overactivity (tachycardia, hypertension, dilated pupils, and hyperreflexia), along with the behavioral changes (paranoia and aggression), suggest intoxication with a stimulant drug. Furthermore, the presence of diaphoresis and cold extremities suggest a state of vasoconstriction, which also supports the idea of a stimulant overdose.

Lastly, the fact that the patient's symptoms started while he was at a party also increases the likelihood of drug use.

From these observations, our initial hypothesis of a drug-induced psychosis or acute intoxication becomes much more likely. A stimulant drug, such as cocaine or amphetamines, is the most probable cause.",Y
"A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her brother for severe chest pain. The patient recently lost her husband in a car accident and is still extremely shocked by the event. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/67 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min and regular, breathing rate is 23/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium.

She has recently experienced a significant emotional trauma, losing her husband in a car accident. Her physical examination reveals an S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes, which indicate fluid buildup in the lungs and could suggest heart failure. Her echocardiogram further supports this, as it shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. However, the context of her significant emotional stress makes Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or ""broken heart syndrome,"" a strong possibility. This condition can mimic the symptoms of a heart attack and is often precipitated by severe stress. It is characterized by a transient left ventricular dysfunction, which is usually reversible.",Y,Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy,"The differential for this patient includes: stress cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo), acute myocardial infarction (MI), pulmonary embolism, anxiety disorder or panic attack, and congestive heart failure.

The patient's severe chest pain, recent extreme emotional stress, S3 heart sound, and the echocardiographic findings of an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium suggest a cardiac origin. Acute MI is less likely given that the ECG shows no significant findings, which usually are present in MI. Pulmonary embolism could present with chest pain and shortness of breath, but there are no specific signs like pleuritic chest pain, sudden onset, risk factors for thromboembolic disease, or signs of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Anxiety or panic attack could also be a possibility given her recent loss, but the physical and echocardiographic findings point towards a cardiac etiology.

The patient's recent extreme stress (losing her husband) coupled with her physical and echocardiographic findings is highly suggestive of stress cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or ""broken heart syndrome,"" which is a temporary heart condition often brought on by stressful situations, such as the death of a loved one. It could lead to severe, temporary heart muscle failure, mimicking symptoms of an MI, but the absence of occlusive coronary artery disease helps distinguish it from an acute MI.",Y,Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy,"This patient's presentation of severe chest pain, tachypnea, S3 heart sound, rales in the lower lobes, and Echocardiography showing an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium in the context of recent severe emotional stress suggest Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy or ""broken heart syndrome."" It typically presents in the setting of severe emotional or physical stress. The pathophysiology is not fully understood but is thought to involve excessive catecholamine release leading to myocardial stunning.",Y,Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy,"This patient is presenting with signs of heart failure (S3 heart sound, rales in the lung lobes indicative of fluid accumulation due to poor heart function) in the context of a recent severe emotional stressor (losing her husband in a car accident). The absence of significant findings on the ECG and the enlarged left ventricle and left atrium seen on echocardiography further support the diagnosis. This constellation of findings is suggestive of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome, where intense emotional or physical stress leads to severe but often reversible heart dysfunction.",Y,Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy,"The prior probability of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome) is roughly 2%. The fact that the patient is a middle-aged woman increases this probability, as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more common in women, let's say to about 10%. The presence of significant emotional stress, in this case the recent loss of her husband, further increases this to about 30%. The presence of symptoms like chest pain increases the likelihood to about 50%. The presence of heart failure symptoms such as an S3 heart sound and rales in the lungs raise this likelihood further to about 70%. Finally, the echocardiogram findings of an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium, without significant findings on ECG, are typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, increasing the probability to about 90%.

"A 55-year-old man presents to a rheumatologist with bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years. The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs. The patient’s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion.

Additionally, the lack of constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills, dryness of mucous membranes, color changes, and joint swelling, combined with the presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints and base of the thumbs, and pain and crepitus on passive range of motion of the knees, suggests osteoarthritis. The distal interphalangeal joints and base of the thumbs are common sites for osteoarthritis. The crepitus noted on knee movement further supports the diagnosis as it often occurs in osteoarthritis due to the degradation of cartilage. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis.",Y,Osteoarthritis,"The differential for this patient includes osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, and lupus. Given the patient's history as a professional athlete, and his current symptoms of joint pain, morning stiffness, and nodules at the distal interphalangeal joints (a distinctive feature), osteoarthritis is more likely. The absence of systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and mucous membrane dryness, makes autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus less likely. Psoriatic arthritis typically involves skin symptoms and inflammation, and gout typically presents with acute, severe pain and inflammation, both of which are absent in this case. The crepitus and tenderness at the base of the thumbs, along with bilateral knee enlargement and pain on motion, are also characteristic features of osteoarthritis.",Y,Osteoarthritis,"This patient's long-term history of joint pain, particularly in the distal interphalangeal joints and base of the thumbs, morning stiffness, and enlarged knees with crepitus on motion, are characteristic of osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, is a classic finding in OA. The chronic nature of the symptoms and the patient's history as a professional athlete (which would increase wear and tear on the joints) further support the diagnosis of OA. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), OA is not typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and chills, or with joint swelling.",Y,Osteoarthritis,"The patient's long history of joint pain and involvement of distal interphalangeal joints with nodules, alongside pain and crepitus in knees, and tenderness at the base of the thumbs, suggest osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease, is typically seen in older individuals or those with a history of significant joint use or trauma, as in this retired professional athlete. Furthermore, the absence of systemic symptoms, swelling, and the presence of morning stiffness that lasts less than an hour are characteristic of osteoarthritis rather than rheumatoid arthritis. Heberden's nodes, which are bony enlargements of the distal interphalangeal joints, are also a classic finding in osteoarthritis.",Y,Osteoarthritis,"The prior probability of osteoarthritis in this patient's case can be considered around 15% because of his age and long-term joint usage due to his past professional athletic career. This probability increases to 25% when considering the patient's symptoms of joint pain in bilateral wrist and knee areas. The reported morning stiffness, which lasts less than an hour, increases the likelihood of osteoarthritis to 40%. Lack of inflammatory symptoms such as joint swelling or constitutional symptoms supports osteoarthritis, raising the probability to 55%. The presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints and thumb base tenderness are hallmark features of osteoarthritis, which elevates the probability to 75%. Enlarged knees with pain and crepitus on passive motion further increases the likelihood of osteoarthritis, thus bringing the posterior probability to approximately 85%.

"A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours. He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left.

The urinalysis shows pyuria (white blood cells in the urine), but the urethral swab doesn't show any organisms, which suggests that this isn't likely to be a sexually transmitted infection. Instead, these findings along with his urinary symptoms and the ultrasound showing increased blood flow to the affected testicle suggest the diagnosis of epididymitis.",N,Epididymitis,"The differential for this patient includes: testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, urinary tract infection (UTI), sexually transmitted infection (STI), and kidney stone. Given the presentation of dull, throbbing scrotal pain, increased urinary frequency, and burning sensation on urination, the most probable diagnoses are epididymitis, UTI, or an STI. The pain relief when lifting the right testicle (Prehn's sign) and increased blood flow to the testicle on ultrasound suggest epididymitis over testicular torsion. The lack of visible organisms on a Gram stain of a urethral swab makes an STI less likely, but does not completely rule it out as some organisms like Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae might not be easily detected this way. However, the patient's sexual history and lack of condom use might suggest an STI-related infection like epididymitis. Considering the entirety of the information, epididymitis is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Y,Chlamydia trachomatis,"The patient presents with a triad of dysuria, testicular pain, and relief with elevation (Prehn's sign) which is characteristic of epididymitis. His history of sexual activity without condom use and the presence of white blood cells in the urine suggest an infection, likely sexually transmitted, as the cause. Gonorrhea and chlamydia are common causes of sexually transmitted epididymitis in sexually active young men, but the negative gram stain result suggests a non-gonococcal cause, likely Chlamydia trachomatis, as the most probable causative organism.",Y,Epididymitis,"This patient's presentation of scrotal pain that is relieved by elevation (known as Prehn's sign), along with recent urinary symptoms, suggests epididymitis, an inflammation of the epididymis usually caused by infection. In sexually active men younger than 35 years, the most common pathogens are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. However, given the lack of urethral discharge, Gram-negative organisms such as E. coli might also be implicated. The increased blood flow on ultrasound is due to the inflammation and resulting hyperemia, a common finding in epididymitis. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is epididymitis, most likely secondary to a sexually transmitted infection or urinary tract infection.",Y,Epididymitis,"Starting from the prior probability, we might estimate that in a sexually active young man presenting with symptoms of dysuria (burning sensation on urination) and increased urinary frequency, urinary tract infection is quite likely, say a prior probability of 20%.

The fact that he has not had urethral discharge does not significantly change the probability of a urinary tract infection (say, it stays around 20%).

The detail that this patient does not use condoms raises the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), which in turn could result in epididymitis, causing the right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain he is experiencing. This information might increase the posterior probability to about 60%.

Physical examination reveals a tender right testicle; relief upon lifting it is a sign often associated with epididymitis, which increases the posterior probability further to 80%.

Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left, which is another indication of inflammation often associated with epididymitis, raising the probability to about 90%.

This combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and ultrasound results makes epididymitis the most likely diagnosis, with the underlying cause most likely being an STI due to the patient's sexual practices.",Y
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to a left breast lump under his nipple. He noticed it last month and felt that it has increased slightly in size. It is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has cryptorchidism as an infant and underwent a successful orchiopexy. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and is currently on methylphenidate with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of type I diabetes in his father and breast fibroadenoma in his mother. On exam, the patient is at the 82nd percentile for height, 79th percentile for weight, and 80th percentile for BMI. He has tanner IV pubic hair. Testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Breast exam shows a normal right breast and a 3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",Glandular tissue enlargement,Fibroadenoma,N,Gynecomastia,Y,Fibroadenoma,N,Fibroadenoma,N,Fibroadenoma,N,,Pubertal gynecomastia,"This patient is a 13-year-old boy who is in the midst of puberty, indicated by Tanner stage IV pubic hair and testicular volumes of 7 mL on each side. He has a firm, tender lump under his left nipple without any abnormal skin changes or discharge. This description is consistent with pubertal gynecomastia, a benign condition that occurs due to the imbalance of estrogen and testosterone during puberty. In many cases, the condition is bilateral, but it can also occur unilaterally, as in this patient's case.",Y,Gynecomastia,"The differential for this patient includes: gynecomastia, breast cancer, fibroadenoma, lipoma, and cyst. Considering the patient's age, breast cancer and fibroadenoma are highly unlikely. The absence of skin changes or nipple discharge also makes breast cancer unlikely. The presentation of a firm, tender mass under the nipple in an adolescent male undergoing puberty is highly suggestive of gynecomastia, which is a benign proliferation of glandular breast tissue in males and can be unilateral or bilateral. It's often seen during periods of hormonal change such as puberty. This patient's Tanner stage indicates he is in puberty, further supporting this diagnosis. Lipoma or cyst would not typically present with tenderness.",Y,Pubertal gynecomastia,"This young boy is going through puberty as indicated by Tanner stage IV pubic hair development and a testicular volume of 7 mL, which is consistent with ongoing pubertal development. Gynecomastia, or enlargement of the male breast tissue, is common in male adolescents and is typically bilateral, but it can sometimes be unilateral as in this case. It's typically due to transient imbalances in sex steroid hormones that occur during puberty. The mass being tender is also a common feature of gynecomastia. The history of cryptorchidism and ADHD treated with methylphenidate do not directly relate to this condition.",Y,Pubertal gynecomastia,"This adolescent boy is experiencing pubertal gynecomastia, a common condition that usually presents bilaterally, but can also occur unilaterally as in this case. This is suggested by the presence of a firm, mobile mass under the nipple, which is tender to touch. In pubertal boys, it is a result of an imbalance between the activity of estrogens (which stimulate breast tissue) and androgens (which inhibit breast tissue). At puberty, transient increase in estrogen production or decrease in testosterone production can lead to slight estrogen dominance and stimulate the growth of male breast tissue. The Tanner stage IV pubic hair and the enlargement of his testes (as indicated by the 7 ml volume on each side) suggest he is in middle-to-late puberty, which is the typical period for the development of pubertal gynecomastia. His previous cryptorchidism and successful orchiopexy are likely unrelated, as cryptorchidism doesn't directly contribute to hormonal imbalances, and ADHD and its treatment with methylphenidate also do not typically cause gynecomastia.",Y,Pubertal Hormonal Changes,"This case describes a 13-year-old boy who has a left breast lump under his nipple that is tender to touch and has been growing in size over the last month.

The prior probability for physiological gynecomastia (a normal hormonal change in adolescents) is about 60% in boys his age. This is because around half of all boys going through puberty experience some degree of breast enlargement due to the hormonal changes occurring at this stage.
His Tanner stage IV pubic hair, which indicates that he is in a relatively advanced stage of puberty, increases this probability to about 70%. At Tanner stage IV, boys have increased levels of estrogen relative to testosterone, which can lead to gynecomastia.
His normal weight and height percentiles, along with a normal BMI, further support the hypothesis of physiological gynecomastia, as obesity (which can cause hormonal imbalances) is not a contributing factor in this case. This increases the probability to around 80%.
Cryptorchidism can be associated with a higher risk of testicular cancer later in life, but it does not directly cause gynecomastia, so this does not change our probability.
Methylphenidate, his medication for ADHD, is not commonly associated with gynecomastia, so this information also does not change our probability.
The physical examination finding of a 3-centimeter round, firm, slightly tender mass under the nipple, without any overlying skin changes or discharge, is typical for physiological gynecomastia. This increases our posterior probability to about 85%.
His family history does not suggest any genetic disorders that could lead to gynecomastia. His mother's history of fibroadenoma and father's history of type I diabetes do not contribute to the likelihood of pathological gynecomastia, so this also does not change our probability.
Given all of this information, the most likely etiology of the patient's condition is physiological gynecomastia due to the hormonal changes of puberty.",Y

Considering the patient's symptoms and the physical exam findings, hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic cancer to the liver are less likely due to the absence of gallstones or biliary obstruction. The ultrasound findings of pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening, coupled with the absence of gallstones, is more suggestive of acalculous cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gallbladder without the presence of gallstones, typically seen in critically ill patients or those with long-term illness.

A 35-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. The patient is found to have a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL. Hgb A1c was found to be 5.1%. C-peptide level was found to be decreased. The patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement. She states that she has never had an episode like this before. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of diabetes in her mother. She states that she has been undergoing a difficult divorce over the past few months. What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?,Factitious disorder,Stress-induced hypoglycemia,N,Stress-induced hypoglycemia,N,Hypoglycemia,N,Stress-induced hypoglycemia,N,Stress-induced hypoglycemia,N,,Factitious hypoglycemia,"The patient was found with a significantly low blood glucose level (hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia can occur in diabetic patients who have taken too much insulin or other glucose-lowering medications, but this is unlikely in this patient as she reports no history of diabetes, and her Hgb A1c is within the normal range, which suggests she has normal glucose control. The fact that the C-peptide level was found to be decreased also points away from excessive insulin produced by the body (C-peptide is released in equal amounts to insulin by the pancreas). Her personal history of stress due to a difficult divorce and the sudden onset of the episode might suggest she has been taking insulin or other hypoglycemic agents surreptitiously, which is known as factitious hypoglycemia. The stress might have triggered her to do this, and the factitious hypoglycemia matches the overall clinical picture best.",Y,Factitious disorder,"The differential for this patient includes: insulinoma, exogenous insulin administration, severe liver disease, adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 2 diabetes). The patient's Hgb A1c is normal, suggesting she does not have uncontrolled diabetes. Her C-peptide level is decreased, which suggests that the source of her hypoglycemia is not due to excessive insulin production by her own body (which would occur in insulinoma). Her rapid return to baseline following glucose replacement would be unusual for sepsis, severe liver disease, or adrenal insufficiency. The fact that she has never had an episode like this before, coupled with her family history of diabetes and stressful life events, raise the possibility of exogenous insulin administration. Therefore, this patient most likely has factitious disorder (self-administration of insulin).",Y,Factitious disorder,"This patient presents with a severe hypoglycemic episode with a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL and the symptoms of unconsciousness were resolved after glucose replacement. However, her HbA1c level, which reflects the average blood glucose level over the past 3 months, is within the normal range (5.1%), suggesting that she does not have chronic hyperglycemia that characterizes diabetes. This discrepancy might suggest that the hypoglycemia is not due to uncontrolled diabetes but perhaps an exogenous source of insulin. Her decreased C-peptide level supports this. C-peptide is a byproduct of insulin production in the body, and a low level indicates that the source of insulin is not from the body's own production. Combined with the psychological stress of her ongoing divorce, these findings are suggestive of factitious disorder imposed on self (previously known as Munchausen syndrome), in which individuals intentionally produce or feign physical symptoms.",Y,Factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome),"This patient's hypoglycemia with a normal HgbA1c and low C-peptide suggests exogenous insulin use. C-peptide is released in equal amounts to insulin by the pancreas, so it should be elevated in cases of insulinoma or other endogenous causes of hyperinsulinism, not decreased. This, combined with the fact that she has been going through a stressful event, such as a difficult divorce, and a family history of diabetes, raises suspicion for factitious disorder imposed on self (previously known as Munchausen syndrome). This is a mental disorder in which a person acts as if they have an illness by deliberately producing, feigning, or exaggerating symptoms.",Y,Factitious hypoglycemia,"The prior probability for insulinoma, a tumor that produces insulin, is low, approximately 1%. However, the patient's significantly low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and lack of a history of diabetes or insulin use raises the suspicion for insulinoma to about 10%. The normal Hgb A1c suggests that she does not have chronic hyperglycemia, further raising the probability of insulinoma to 15%. The decreased C-peptide level is critical in this situation because it suggests that her insulin is not being produced endogenously (as in insulinoma, which typically produces both insulin and C-peptide) but rather being introduced exogenously, which could happen with self-administration of insulin. This evidence significantly raises the posterior probability for factitious hypoglycemia (self-induced for attention or other psychological reasons) to about 60%. Considering her current stressful life situation (undergoing a difficult divorce), which is known to be associated with factitious disorders, the probability for factitious hypoglycemia is further increased to about 85%. This patient likely has factitious hypoglycemia, where the patient might have been self-administering insulin.",Y

Dysmenorrhea is very common and is usually not indicative of any underlying disease, particularly in younger women with normal physical examinations, like this patient. The fact that the pain is somewhat relieved by ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, also supports the diagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea. This is because dysmenorrhea pain is often caused by increased production of endometrial prostaglandins, and NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.",Y,Primary dysmenorrhea,"The differential for this patient includes: dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ovarian cyst, or sexually transmitted infection (STI). This patient presents with cyclical pelvic pain that begins just prior to menstruation and lasts for the first few days of her cycle. The nature of her pain and the timing strongly suggests primary dysmenorrhea, which is a common condition in adolescent girls and young women. The relief provided by ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), also supports this diagnosis, as NSAIDs work by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are elevated in primary dysmenorrhea. Additionally, the absence of other symptoms or abnormal physical findings makes other diagnoses less likely. While the patient is sexually active with inconsistent condom use, which could raise concern for PID or STIs, she does not have other signs or symptoms typically associated with these conditions, such as vaginal discharge, fever, or pain that is not cyclical or linked to her menstrual cycle.",Y,Primary dysmenorrhea,"The patient's symptoms of cyclical pelvic pain that starts a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days, along with the fact that the pain is somewhat relieved by ibuprofen, suggest primary dysmenorrhea, which is caused by the production of prostaglandins in the endometrium leading to uterine cramping. In sexually active women, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or sexually transmitted infections might also be considered. However, she has no abnormal physical examination findings or signs of infection, which makes these diagnoses less likely. Therefore, her symptoms are most likely due to primary dysmenorrhea.",Y,Primary dysmenorrhea,"The patient's symptoms suggest a gynecologic origin due to their timing with her menstrual cycle. The fact that the pain is episodic and coincides with her menstrual period is suggestive of primary dysmenorrhea, a common cause of pelvic pain in adolescents and young women. Primary dysmenorrhea usually presents a few years after menarche once ovulatory cycles have been established and tends to decrease with age. It is typically characterized by crampy pelvic pain that may radiate to the back or inner thighs and starts shortly before or at the onset of menses, lasting 1-3 days. The pain is thought to be due to uterine contractions and the release of prostaglandins during menses, and is usually responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, which inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.",Y,Primary dysmenorrhea,"The prior probability of primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents is around 70%. The pain occurring a few hours before her menstrual period and lasting for 2 days increases the likelihood of primary dysmenorrhea to around 85%. The relief from ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used to treat dysmenorrhea, further raises the probability to around 95%. There is no indication of secondary dysmenorrhea symptoms like irregular periods, significant dyspareunia, or abnormal physical exam findings. Therefore, the posterior probability that the patient has primary dysmenorrhea is extremely high.",Y
"A 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue. He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms “most of the time.” On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. Tourniquet test is negative. Laboratory results are as follows:

Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
Hematocrit: 44%

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Chikungunya,Dengue fever,N,Dengue fever,N,Dengue fever,N,Dengue fever,N,Dengue Fever,N,,Chikungunya,"The patient's recent travel to Southeast Asia, along with his presentation of fever, rash, and joint pain, strongly suggest a mosquito-borne disease. His normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, and a negative tourniquet test help to rule out diseases like dengue, which usually present with hemoconcentration and positive tourniquet test. His leukocyte count is low and platelet count is moderately low but not extremely low, which is typically observed in dengue. The mild elevation in AST and ALT could be due to liver inflammation, a common feature in many viral diseases.

Given these symptoms and the recent travel history, the most likely diagnosis is Chikungunya. Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain, often in hands and wrists, which is reflected in this patient's complaints. Other symptoms include rash, fatigue, and headache, all of which the patient is also experiencing.",Y,Chikungunya,"The differential diagnoses for this patient includes various infectious diseases considering his recent travel to Vietnam and Cambodia. These may include diseases such as dengue fever, malaria, typhoid fever, leptospirosis, and various forms of viral hepatitis.

His symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, joint pain, and rash are suggestive of a systemic infection. Dengue fever and malaria are common in Southeast Asia and can present with these symptoms, but his negative tourniquet test and normal platelet count make dengue less likely, as dengue often presents with thrombocytopenia and a positive tourniquet test. Malaria also typically presents with cyclical fever and chills, which this patient does not report.

Leptospirosis can present with similar symptoms, but usually also presents with conjunctival suffusion and potentially kidney injury, neither of which are seen in this patient. Hepatitis A or E could also be possible, as they are common in areas with poor sanitation and can present with systemic symptoms, but these diseases primarily cause liver inflammation, and the patient's relatively normal bilirubin and slightly increased AST and ALT don't strongly suggest acute viral hepatitis.

His maculopapular rash, fever, and joint pain, particularly in the metacarpophalangeal joints, are strongly suggestive of Chikungunya. Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease prevalent in many parts of Asia, and it's known for its hallmark arthralgia, particularly in the smaller joints. Therefore, this patient most likely has Chikungunya.",Y,Dengue Fever,"This patient presents with fatigue, headache, malaise, joint pain, and a maculopapular rash after recent travel to Southeast Asia. His symptoms along with leukopenia (lowered white blood cell count) and thrombocytopenia (lowered platelet count) are suggestive of a systemic viral infection. Given his travel history, a disease that would be common in that area would be Dengue fever. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness common in tropical and subtropical areas and can present with fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, and a rash that is often described as maculopapular. In addition, the abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST and ALT) are also in line with this diagnosis. His negative tourniquet test makes dengue hemorrhagic fever less likely.",N,Chikungunya virus,"This patient's recent travel history to Vietnam and Cambodia, along with his symptoms of fever, headache, malaise, joint pain, and a maculopapular rash, are highly suggestive of a tropical infectious disease. Dengue fever and Zika virus are possibilities, but the absence of a positive tourniquet test and a normal platelet count makes Dengue less likely. Zika, while often associated with conjunctivitis which is not present here, may still be a possibility. However, his leukopenia and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are more suggestive of another flavivirus infection, Hepatitis A, which is prevalent in those regions and can be transmitted through contaminated food and water, common in travelers. However, the lack of gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea make it less likely.

Given his symptoms and laboratory findings, another possibility is Chikungunya virus. This is an arbovirus endemic to similar regions as Dengue and Zika, and it notably causes severe arthralgia or arthritis, which could explain the pain in his hands and wrists. While it does not typically cause leukopenia, individual responses can vary.",Y,Dengue Fever,"The Bayesian inference process begins by considering the prior probability for various potential diseases this patient might have, based on the general prevalence of those diseases. Given the symptoms of fatigue, headache, malaise, pain in hands and wrists, and rash, as well as the recent travel history to Vietnam and Cambodia, conditions such as malaria, dengue, and other tropical diseases would be in the differential.

The posterior probability is then updated based on the given evidence. The patient's maculopapular rash, joint pain, and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), coupled with a history of travel to a region where dengue is endemic, increase the likelihood of dengue fever. The negative tourniquet test, while not definitively ruling out dengue, makes the diagnosis somewhat less likely. However, given the absence of clear evidence for another disease, the posterior probability for dengue remains relatively high.

Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, as seen in this patient's lab results, also commonly occur in dengue fever, further increasing the posterior probability. Absence of obvious signs of hemorrhage (e.g., no bleeding noted on physical examination or lab tests) does not exclude dengue since hemorrhagic symptoms only occur in severe dengue, which is less common.

The absence of reported respiratory symptoms or known contacts with tuberculosis decreases the likelihood of diseases like tuberculosis, despite the patient's travel history.

Asthma and the patient's sexual activity add some probability to diseases like sexually transmitted infections and conditions aggravated by asthma, but there is not much evidence to support these as the primary diagnosis here.

In summary, based on the Bayesian inference process, the most likely diagnosis in this patient, given the current evidence, is dengue fever.",N
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause of the mass?",Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis,Hydrocele,Y,Hydrocele,Y,Hydrocele,Y,Hydrocele,Y,Hydrocele,Y,,Hydrocele,"This 40-year-old man presents with a painless, right-sided scrotal mass that he first noticed several weeks ago, which is not always present. The mass is soft, cystic, nontender, and does not increase in size when he coughs. These characteristics do not align with a malignancy, which is typically a solid and painful mass that does not change in size with coughing or position. Notably, the mass transilluminates, which suggests it's filled with fluid. The ability to palpate normal tissue above the mass and the lack of bowel sounds suggest it's not an inguinal hernia. These clinical features are most consistent with a hydrocele, which is a collection of serous fluid in the tunica vaginalis of the testicle.",Y,Hydrocele,"The differential diagnoses for a scrotal swelling include hernia, hydrocele, varicocele, testicular tumor, and epididymal cyst. However, in this case, the mass is painless, soft, cystic, and nontender, which is not typical of a hernia or testicular tumor. The fact that it transilluminates, does not increase in size on coughing, and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass, makes hernia and testicular tumor less likely. Hernias typically present with an impulse on coughing and can often be reduced when the patient is supine. Testicular tumors are usually solid and do not transilluminate. The characteristics of the mass, including its cystic nature and transillumination, are more suggestive of a hydrocele or epididymal cyst. However, an epididymal cyst would typically be located at the superior and posterior aspect of the testis. Given that the mass is not associated with the testis and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass, a hydrocele is the most likely cause.",Y,Idiopathic Hydrocele,"This patient's scrotal swelling that is painless, transilluminates, does not increase in size on coughing (meaning it's not a hernia), and allows for palpation of normal tissue above it is consistent with a hydrocele. Hydroceles are collections of serous fluid in the tunica vaginalis of the scrotum, and are the most common cause of painless scrotal swelling. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, trauma, or tumor, but they can also be idiopathic. In this case, there is no evidence of any of these other potential causes, making idiopathic hydrocele the most likely diagnosis.",Y,Hydrocele,"The patient has a large, painless, cystic scrotal mass that transilluminates, which suggests the presence of fluid. An important clue to the diagnosis is that it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. This feature distinguishes a hydrocele, which is fluid in the tunica vaginalis, from an inguinal hernia, which would move downwards with coughing or strain and often reduce in a supine position. A hydrocele would not normally be associated with bowel sounds, as it is fluid around the testicle, not a protrusion of the abdominal cavity. Also, the fact that the mass does not increase on coughing rules out varicocele, which is a dilation of the pampiniform venous plexus and usually enlarges with Valsalva maneuver. The history of the patient's father having a seminoma at age 25 suggests a familial or genetic predisposition to testicular cancer, but the physical findings in this case do not suggest malignancy as the examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely cause of the mass is a hydrocele.",Y,Hydrocele,"The prior probability of a hydrocele, given the patient's symptoms and demographics, is about 30%. The characteristics of the mass (soft, cystic, transilluminating) are consistent with a hydrocele, which increases the posterior probability to about 60%. The lack of increased size upon coughing and the ability to palpate normal tissue above the mass further increase the probability to 80%. The absence of bowel sounds and non-reducibility when supine rule out an inguinal hernia, and the normal testicular examination helps rule out a testicular tumor. Taking into account all of these factors, it's very likely that the cause of the mass is a hydrocele.",Y
"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",Staphylococcus aureus,Food poisoning,N,Food poisoning,N,Food poisoning,N,Food poisoning,N,Food poisoning.,N,,Food poisoning,"This patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea developed within a few hours of eating at a buffet without refrigeration, which suggests food poisoning. The most common organisms that cause food poisoning with symptoms appearing within this timeframe are Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, both of which produce preformed toxins that can cause rapid onset of symptoms after ingestion. Given the lack of other notable signs or symptoms such as fever or bloody stools, it's most likely this patient is suffering from food poisoning due to ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins.",Y,Food poisoning,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: food poisoning, viral gastroenteritis, bacterial enteritis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given the history of recent ingestion of food left out in the warm weather and the rapid onset of symptoms, food poisoning is more likely. This rapid onset points towards Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, both of which can produce preformed enterotoxins that lead to symptoms in as little as 1-6 hours post ingestion. Considering these factors, this patient's presentation is most likely due to food poisoning from preformed bacterial enterotoxins, potentially from Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus.",Y,Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning,"This patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea developing within a few hours after eating food that had been left out unrefrigerated are suggestive of food poisoning. The most common cause of such rapid-onset food poisoning is Staphylococcus aureus, which produces enterotoxins that cause symptoms within 1-6 hours after ingestion of contaminated food. The toxins act on the gut lining, causing an outpouring of fluid that leads to watery diarrhea.",Y,Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning,"This patient's acute gastroenteritis symptoms began within a few hours after eating at a buffet without refrigeration. This points to a likely foodborne illness caused by a toxin-producing bacteria. The most common bacteria fitting this description is Staphylococcus aureus, which can produce enterotoxins in food left at room temperature. The toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus are heat-stable and can cause rapid onset of symptoms, typically within 1-6 hours after ingestion. These toxins stimulate the intestinal wall causing abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.",Y,Foodborne Illness,"In Bayesian inference, we start with a prior probability of each possible cause and update these probabilities with each new piece of evidence.

Given the symptoms described in the case, several different gastrointestinal problems could be causing the patient's presentation. This could range from a simple bacterial infection, such as Salmonella or E. coli, to other more severe diseases.

The prior probability for foodborne illness in a patient presenting with abdominal pain and diarrhea is quite high, given how common these conditions are. Let's estimate this probability as 60%.

The fact that the patient was at a barbecue and ate from a buffet without refrigeration increases the likelihood of foodborne illness. Many pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, can grow in food left out at room temperature, which can lead to rapid onset of symptoms if ingested. This evidence could increase the probability of foodborne illness to about 80%.

The fact that symptoms developed within 2 to 3 hours after eating is another significant piece of evidence. Rapid onset of symptoms after eating contaminated food is characteristic of certain types of foodborne illness, particularly those caused by pre-formed toxins such as those produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. This could increase the probability of foodborne illness to around 90%.

The abdominal examination findings of pain with deep palpation, but no rebounding or guarding, are somewhat nonspecific but are consistent with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis, which can be caused by foodborne pathogens. The absence of blood on fecal occult testing further supports a diagnosis of foodborne illness over other, more severe conditions that might cause bloody diarrhea, like ischemic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease.

With all of these factors taken into account, we can say that the posterior probability of a foodborne illness is very high, given the patient's presentation and the associated circumstances.",Y

The clinical features of pneumonia include a productive cough, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and fever, as well as signs of consolidation on physical examination, such as decreased breath sounds and crackles. The worsening of symptoms and a lack of improvement after an initial improvement, the boy's relatively young age, and a high white blood cell count (leukocytosis) with an increase in neutrophils are consistent with bacterial pneumonia.

This is a rare disorder caused by a postzygotic mutation in the GNAS1 gene, leading to mosaicism. The mutation causes constitutive activation of the Gs protein, leading to overproduction of cAMP and overactivity of downstream hormones such as estrogen, leading to precocious puberty. Furthermore, the mutation also affects bone-forming cells and results in polyostotic fibrous dysplasia as a result of abnormal bone remodeling.",Y,McCune-Albright Syndrome,"This patient's presentation suggests a condition known as precocious puberty which can occur due to a multitude of underlying causes. One such cause is McCune-Albright Syndrome which is associated with the symptoms this patient exhibits. The prior probability of McCune-Albright Syndrome in the general population is very low. However, the presence of multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches (caf�-au-lait spots) on the patient's trunk, combined with precocious puberty, and patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis in the femur (indicative of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia) all contribute to increasing the posterior probability of this syndrome.

The caf�-au-lait spots increase the probability from near zero to around 10%, given their frequent occurrence in McCune-Albright Syndrome. The presence of precocious puberty increases this to around 60% as this is a key feature of the syndrome. The detection of the radiographic changes in the femur adds further weight to this diagnosis, raising the probability to roughly 85%. Thus, based on these findings, it's highly probable that the patient has McCune-Albright Syndrome.",Y

This includes Alport syndrome, Usher syndrome, Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, and Refsum disease.

Usher syndrome: is characterized by hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa, but there is no typical renal involvement.
Branchio-oto-renal syndrome: can present with hearing loss and kidney abnormalities, but it is not typically associated with visual abnormalities like lens dislocation.
Refsum disease: includes retinitis pigmentosa, neuropathy, and anosmia but again does not typically have renal involvement.
Alport syndrome: This is an inherited disorder characterized by progressive renal failure, hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. The patient's father also has a history of renal transplant in his 20s, which suggests an inherited renal disease. The anterior lenticonus seen on ophthalmologic examination and high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss on audiometry are classic findings of Alport syndrome. The proteinuria and hematuria further suggest renal involvement.
Given these findings, this patient's symptoms are most likely explained by Alport syndrome.",Y,Alport Syndrome,"This patient presents with sensorineural hearing loss, visual disturbances, and a family history of kidney disease (his father received a renal transplant in his 20s), along with urinary findings suggestive of glomerular disease (blood and protein in the urine). The hallmark ocular sign of Alport syndrome, which is an inherited disorder, is anterior lenticonus, as seen in this patient. Alport syndrome is characterized by nephropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and ocular abnormalities. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms, family history, and the results of the laboratory and physical examinations, Alport syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",Y,Alport Syndrome,"The patient presents with high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, anterior lenticonus (an abnormal bulging shape of the lens of the eye), and renal symptoms, including blood and protein in the urine, which suggest kidney dysfunction. These symptoms together with a family history of a renal transplant strongly suggest Alport syndrome. Alport syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. It is typically an X-linked disorder, which explains why the father had a renal transplant in his 20s. The abnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus) is a very specific sign of Alport syndrome.",Y,Alport Syndrome,"The prior probability of Alport syndrome in the general population is quite low (<0.005%). However, the patient presents with hearing loss and vision problems, specifically anterior lenticonus (a type of lens abnormality) which increases the posterior probability to 30%. The patient also has hematuria and proteinuria, often seen in Alport syndrome, which further raises the probability to 50%. The familial history of a renal transplant in the father suggests a hereditary kidney disease, which increases the probability of Alport syndrome to 75%. With all these signs and symptoms taken into account, this patient likely has Alport syndrome.",Y
"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Vaginal septum,Primary ovarian insufficiency,N,Hypothalamic amenorrhea,N,Primary ovarian insufficiency,N,Hypothalamic amenorrhea,N,Primary ovarian insufficiency,N,,Hypothalamic amenorrhea,"The 16-year-old female patient in the case is presenting with primary amenorrhea (absence of menstruation by age 15 in females who have otherwise gone through puberty). She has normal secondary sexual characteristics (breast development and pubic hair), indicating that she has been experiencing normal hormonal changes associated with puberty. The laboratory studies show normal levels of FSH and estrogen, further indicating that the hormones associated with menstruation are being produced normally. An abdominal ultrasound confirms the presence of normal uterus and ovaries, ruling out anatomical abnormalities as the cause of her amenorrhea. Considering her history of recurrent headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea, the most likely diagnosis is a migraine disorder which is known to cause menstrual irregularities. However, the specific subtype of amenorrhea that could be related to migraines is hypothalamic amenorrhea, due to the stress and intensive exercise regimen of a competitive skater affecting the function of her hypothalamus.",N,Hypothalamic amenorrhea,"The differential diagnosis for a 16-year-old female with primary amenorrhea (lack of menstruation by age 16 or 2 years after secondary sexual characteristics development) includes: Turner syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, hypothalamic dysfunction, pituitary disease, or Mullerian agenesis. However, the patient's normal development of secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner IV breast and pubic hair development) and normal FSH and estrogen levels suggest normal ovarian function and rules out Turner syndrome and pituitary disease. A normal abdominal ultrasound also argues against Mullerian agenesis, as this would typically result in abnormal or absent uterus.

Given her history of migraines and normal hormone levels, a plausible diagnosis could be hypothalamic amenorrhea. This condition is often seen in females who participate in high-level athletics or have significant stress, as the hypothalamus suppresses the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), reducing the downstream release of FSH and LH, and therefore, suppressing menstruation.

Her BMI is normal and she does not have features of polycystic ovary syndrome such as hirsutism or obesity, thus making hypothalamic amenorrhea due to stress from high-level athletics the most likely diagnosis.",N,Transverse vaginal septum,"This 16-year-old girl presents with primary amenorrhea (lack of menstruation by age 15 in the presence of secondary sexual characteristics or by age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics) but normal growth and development. Her follicle-stimulating hormone and estrogen levels are normal, indicating functioning ovaries. Additionally, the abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries, eliminating any anatomical abnormalities. She is Tanner stage IV, which means she has secondary sexual characteristics, yet she has never menstruated. This discrepancy suggests an outflow obstruction, most likely a result of imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum. However, the partial examination of the vaginal canal (as much as the patient could tolerate) was unremarkable, which makes an imperforate hymen less likely. Therefore, a transverse vaginal septum is more likely. This condition is a type of M�llerian duct anomaly in which a fibrous band of tissue forms across the vagina, blocking the outflow tract. It may not be detected on an incomplete pelvic exam, which seems to be the case here.",Y,M�llerian agenesis,"This 16-year-old female patient has primary amenorrhea (lack of menarche by age 15 despite normal growth and secondary sexual characteristic development), which can be caused by various structural or hormonal issues. Normal breast development and Tanner IV pubic hair growth indicates that the patient has sufficient estrogen, which is supported by the lab results. This means that the primary amenorrhea is likely not due to an issue with the production of sex hormones. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, which ruled out the structural abnormalities in the uterus and ovaries. The patient's inability to tolerate a full pelvic exam is also a significant finding. This might indicate an imperforate hymen or other vaginal outflow tract obstruction. An imperforate hymen would have allowed the buildup of estrogen-stimulated endometrial tissue without a way for menstrual blood to exit the vagina, but the patient's history does not mention abdominal pain or a mass in the lower abdomen, making this diagnosis unlikely. Another possible cause of primary amenorrhea is M�llerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser syndrome), which is a congenital malformation characterized by a failure of the M�llerian ducts to develop, resulting in a missing or incomplete vagina and/or uterus. Despite this, ovarian function is typically normal, which fits with the patient's normal estrogen level, breast development, and pubic hair growth. Although an ultrasound shows a normal uterus, in some cases, M�llerian agenesis might not be detected, particularly if a rudimentary uterus is present.",N,Imperforate hymen,"The patient's presentation is of primary amenorrhea which has various possible causes. The probability of Mullerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome) as the cause is approximately 15% in primary amenorrhea cases.

The fact that the patient has Tanner stage IV breast and pubic hair development suggests that she has functional ovaries that are producing estrogen, this is further supported by her normal estrogen levels in lab results, thus reducing the posterior probability of conditions such as Turner syndrome which would result in estrogen deficiency. The reduced posterior probability of other conditions, therefore, increases the relative probability of Mullerian agenesis to approximately 30%.

The fact that the patient has been experiencing headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea that are relieved by ibuprofen, which matches her mother's history of migraines, might initially suggest a neurological or endocrine condition. However, these symptoms can be consistent with normal adolescence and are not necessarily indicative of an underlying condition causing the amenorrhea. Therefore, these symptoms do not significantly alter the posterior probability.

Abdominal ultrasound showing a normal uterus and ovaries decreases the probability of anatomical anomalies such as MRKH syndrome. Given that the patient has developed secondary sexual characteristics and has normal estrogen levels, but yet has not started menstruating, the most likely diagnosis would be a functional or structural issue at the level of the cervix or vagina. Inability to complete a pelvic exam could suggest a physical barrier such as imperforate hymen or transverse vaginal septum. The posterior probability of an imperforate hymen or similar structural issue causing the amenorrhea in this case is therefore increased to approximately 50%.",N
"A 48-year-old homeless male is brought to the emergency department, by the police, for altered mental status. Past medical records are unavailable. A physical exam on admission reveals scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists during extension. The patient is admitted to the hospital and his treatment is started after appropriate investigation. The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. What medications did this patient most likely receive after admission?",Lactulose,Benzodiazepines and thiamine.,N,"Lactulose, rifaximin, and neomycin.",Y,Benzodiazepines,N,Antibiotics,N,"Lactulose, antibiotics",Y,,Lactulose,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of advanced liver disease, likely due to alcoholism given his homelessness, which is commonly associated with substance abuse. Scleral icterus indicates jaundice, suggesting liver dysfunction, and the flapping tremor (asterixis) is a sign of hepatic encephalopathy. The treatment for hepatic encephalopathy typically involves reducing the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut using lactulose and possibly rifaximin. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that is metabolized by gut bacteria into lactic acid and acetic acid, resulting in an acidic environment in the colon. This acidity promotes the conversion of ammonia to ammonium, which is not absorbable and thus decreases the blood ammonia level, improving mental status. A common side effect of lactulose is diarrhea and flatulence, which this patient experienced. Therefore, it's likely the patient received lactulose.",Y,Lactulose (and possibly Rifaximin),"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes liver disease leading to hepatic encephalopathy, withdrawal symptoms from alcohol or other substances, and a wide variety of infections, given his homelessness and lack of known medical history. However, given the presence of scleral icterus (indicative of jaundice or liver disease) and a flapping tremor (also known as asterixis, often seen in hepatic encephalopathy), the most likely diagnosis is hepatic encephalopathy. The hepatic encephalopathy is likely due to advanced liver disease, possibly due to alcoholism given his homelessness and the high prevalence of alcohol use disorder in this population.

Given that his mental status improved and his hand tremor resolved, the medications likely used are lactulose and possibly rifaximin. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that decreases the absorption of ammonia from the gut, thereby reducing the levels of ammonia reaching the liver and the brain. This can rapidly improve symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. If available and the diagnosis is certain, rifaximin may also be added. Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that further reduces the production of ammonia by gut bacteria.

The patient's diarrhea and flatulence are likely side effects of the lactulose, which can cause these symptoms due to its osmotic effect in the gut.",Y,Lactulose (and possibly Rifaximin),"The clinical presentation in this case suggests that this patient has hepatic encephalopathy and is likely suffering from alcohol-related liver disease, as suggested by his homelessness (risk factor for alcohol abuse), altered mental status, scleral icterus (jaundice - sign of liver dysfunction), and flapping tremor (asterixis - sign of hepatic encephalopathy). The treatment of hepatic encephalopathy typically includes lactulose and rifaximin.

Lactulose, a non-absorbable sugar, is used to decrease blood ammonia levels, a key factor contributing to hepatic encephalopathy. It works by acidifying the gut lumen and trapping ammonia in the colon for excretion in feces. It also acts as an osmotic laxative. The side effects of lactulose therapy, such as diarrhea and flatulence, correspond to the patient's overnight symptoms.

Rifaximin is an antibiotic that is also used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. It reduces the ammonia-producing gut flora and, unlike lactulose, it does not typically cause diarrhea.

The resolution of the patient's altered mental status and hand tremor, along with the emergence of diarrhea and flatulence, suggest that he received lactulose (and possibly rifaximin) for hepatic encephalopathy.",Y,Lactulose and rifaximin,"The presenting signs and symptoms suggest the patient was experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs as a result of liver disease (implied by scleral icterus, or yellowing of the eyes) leading to an accumulation of toxins in the bloodstream which can affect mental functioning. The flapping tremor of the wrists, or asterixis, is a classic clinical sign. Improvement in the mental status and resolution of the hand tremor suggest he received treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. The most commonly used treatments for hepatic encephalopathy are lactulose and rifaximin. Lactulose works by reducing absorption of ammonia in the colon, while rifaximin is an antibiotic that reduces the production of ammonia by gut bacteria. The diarrhea and flatulence the patient experienced are common side effects of lactulose.",Y,Lactulose,"In this case, the prior probability is derived from the patients symptoms and signs. The patient's altered mental status, scleral icterus, and flapping tremor suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is common in individuals with chronic liver disease. This increases the probability that lactulose (a medication used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing the absorption of ammonia in the colon) was administered, let's say to 50%. Additionally, the improvement in the patient's mental status and resolution of hand tremor post-admission supports this inference, raising the probability to 70%.

The patient's complaints of numerous episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence are common side effects of lactulose treatment, which further increases the posterior probability to 90%. Therefore, this patient most likely received lactulose after admission.",Y
"A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. What is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?",Sympathetic block,Epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension,Y,Hypovolemia,N,Epidural anesthesia-induced hypotension.,Y,Hypovolemia,N,Epidural hypotension,Y,,Epidural anesthesia,"The patient is a pregnant woman in active labor, who recently had an epidural anesthesia. Her blood pressure has decreased significantly, causing her to feel dizzy. These signs are indicative of hypotension due to epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia can block sympathetic nerves, which maintain the tone of blood vessels, thus leading to vasodilation and subsequent hypotension. This is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, particularly in pregnant women.",Y,Epidural-induced hypotension,"The differential for this patient includes: hypovolemia secondary to blood loss, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, vasovagal syncope, amniotic fluid embolism, and epidural-induced hypotension. Blood loss or aortic dissection would likely be associated with more significant changes in vital signs and potentially signs of shock, which are not described here. Vasovagal syncope usually causes bradycardia and hypotension, but the onset in this case doesn't support this diagnosis. Pulmonary embolism usually presents with chest pain and/or dyspnea, which are absent in this patient. Amniotic fluid embolism can present with sudden cardiovascular collapse, but this is rare and usually accompanied by more severe symptoms such as seizures or cardiac arrest.

Given the timing of the hypotension immediately after the administration of epidural anesthesia, the most likely diagnosis is hypotension caused by the epidural. This is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, resulting from the blockade of sympathetic nerves and leading to vasodilation and hypotension.",Y,Epidural anesthesia,"This pregnant patient at 40 weeks' gestation is in active labor and has received an epidural anesthesia. Soon after the procedure, she develops hypotension. This is a known side effect of epidural anesthesia, because the local anesthetics used can block sympathetic nerve fibers, leading to vasodilation and resulting in decreased systemic vascular resistance and hypotension. While other causes of hypotension are possible, given the timing of the symptom after epidural administration, epidural anesthesia is the most likely cause.",Y,Epidural-induced hypotension,"The patient's hypotension following the epidural anesthesia can be attributed to a common side effect known as neurogenic or vasodilatory shock. An epidural anesthesia works by blocking nerve impulses in the lower spinal segments which, apart from its analgesic effects, often causes vasodilation in the lower body (legs, pelvis). The vasodilation increases the capacity of the blood vessels, which leads to a relative decrease in blood pressure, thus causing hypotension. This is especially relevant in pregnancy, as the gravid uterus can compress the vena cava, limiting venous return to the heart and exacerbating the hypotensive effect. The hypotension can cause symptoms like dizziness. Initial treatment is often with intravenous fluid resuscitation to improve preload and counteract the decrease in systemic vascular resistance.",Y,Epidural anesthesia,"Let's analyze the patient's condition using a Bayesian approach:

The prior probability of hypotension due to epidural anesthesia in laboring women is fairly high, since it is a known and common side effect of epidural anesthesia. Let's start with this as a hypothetical baseline at 50%.
The patient's symptoms of dizziness started almost immediately after epidural anesthesia was administered, further raising the posterior probability of this being the cause of her hypotension to around 70%.
The patient's vitals, particularly a decrease in blood pressure, corroborate this hypothesis. No other symptoms suggest another diagnosis. This can increase the probability to 85%.
Lastly, there was a prompt initiation of intravenous fluid resuscitation, a standard response to hypotension following epidural anesthesia. The decision of the health care professionals who are attending to the patient also supports this inference, pushing our estimated probability to about 95%.
This patient's hypotension is most likely caused by the epidural anesthesia.",Y
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has noticed trembling of her hands for the past 5 months. These movements are only present when she reaches to pick up an object or answer the phone. She has a history of major depressive disorder but has been off medications for the past 3 years. Her father had Parkinson's disease and died 6 months ago. She drinks a glass of wine daily. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 118/74 mm Hg. A low-frequency tremor is present that worsens as she reaches out for an object. She consistently overshoots her target. There is no tremor present when her arms are held outstretched. There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally.

These symptoms can be associated with a variety of neurological conditions, but given the specifics of her symptoms and the presence of a positive bilateral Babinski's sign, this suggests a disorder involving the upper motor neurons, likely originating in the brain. While her father had Parkinson's disease, her symptoms are not typical for this condition as Parkinson's typically presents with a resting tremor, which is not mentioned here. Instead, the condition that best fits her symptoms is cerebrovascular disease, which can cause damage to the upper motor neurons resulting in the signs observed.",N,Multiple sclerosis,"The differential for this patient includes Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, Multiple sclerosis, and Cerebrovascular disease. Parkinson's disease usually presents with a resting tremor, not an action tremor as in this case, and typically wouldn't result in a positive Babinski's sign. Essential tremor is characterized by a postural or action tremor but doesn't typically present with increased tone in the lower extremities or a positive Babinski's sign. Cerebrovascular disease might present with a variety of motor disturbances, including tremor and increased tone, and could potentially lead to a positive Babinski's sign, but the tremor would not typically worsen with action. Multiple sclerosis can present with a variety of symptoms, including tremor, increased muscle tone, and a positive Babinski's sign. Given this patient's symptoms, the most likely cause is Multiple sclerosis.
",Y,Cerebellar disorder,"This patient's tremor, which increases as she reaches out for an object and overshoots her target, is consistent with an intention tremor - a classic sign of cerebellar dysfunction. In addition, the patient has increased tone in the lower extremities and a positive Babinski's sign - both of which can be seen in upper motor neuron lesions. Given the combination of these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a cerebellar disorder possibly due to a lesion in the cerebellum or its connecting pathways, such as a stroke or multiple sclerosis. Her family history of Parkinson's disease could potentially be relevant, but her symptoms are not consistent with Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by a resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability.",Y,Multiple sclerosis,"This patient is presenting with symptoms that are suggestive of a lesion in the cerebellum, specifically within the lateral hemispheres. The lateral cerebellum is involved in planning and executing movements, and lesions in this region often result in an intention tremor, a type of tremor that worsens as an individual reaches for an object, as well as dysmetria, which is the overshooting or undershooting of intended position. Her other symptom of increased tone in the lower extremities and a positive Babinski's sign point towards an upper motor neuron lesion. It is possible that the patient has a lesion affecting both cerebellar and upper motor neuron pathways, perhaps due to a vascular event or a degenerative disease, like Multiple Sclerosis.",Y,Multiple sclerosis,"The prior probability of Essential Tremor is typically quite high (5%) given it's a common cause of tremor, however, the patient's tremor worsening with goal-directed movements (action tremor), overshooting her target, and the absence of a resting tremor are features that are also seen in Essential Tremor, which increases the posterior probability of Essential Tremor to around 20%.

However, the presence of increased tone in the lower extremities and a positive Babinski's sign are suggestive of upper motor neuron lesion, which is not typical in Essential Tremor. This instead points towards a different diagnosis.

Taking these into account, these symptoms are more likely suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis, which is a neurological condition that can cause both tremors and upper motor neuron signs. The prior probability of Multiple Sclerosis is lower (1%) but with the presence of these signs, the posterior probability of Multiple Sclerosis could increase to about 40%.

While Parkinson's disease might also be considered due to her father's history and the presence of tremor, Parkinson's is typically characterized by a resting tremor, which this patient does not have. Hence, the probability of Parkinson's Disease would not increase significantly in this case.

So, in this case, Multiple Sclerosis appears to be the most likely diagnosis.",Y
"A 19-year-old man in a 3-month relationship with a woman experiences frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers. He lives in a conservative community and does not know any openly gay men.

Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which a person behaves in a way opposite to their true feelings or desires in order to keep those feelings hidden.

His aggressive behavior towards a gay couple may be understood through the lens of several defense mechanisms. Projection is one: he is attributing his own unacceptable desires to others (the gay couple). Reaction formation, where an individual behaves in a way opposite to what they truly feel, is also at play here: he is joining a hate group and participating in hate crimes against people who represent what he subconsciously identifies with. In essence, his internal conflict about his sexual orientation may be manifesting as external aggression towards people who are open about the same desires that he himself is experiencing.",Y,Projection,"The psychological defense mechanism this individual is displaying can be identified using Bayesian inference. Starting with the prior probabilities, it's important to note that there are many possible defense mechanisms an individual might employ, and we don't have a ""standard"" prior probability for each one. However, based on the description, two mechanisms seem particularly likely: repression and projection.

Repression involves the unconscious blocking of unacceptable thoughts, feelings and impulses. The fact that this man is having sexual fantasies about male coworkers, which may be unacceptable to his conservative community, suggests a 25% chance that repression is occurring.

Projection involves attributing one's own unacceptable feelings, thoughts, and impulses to another person. The fact that this man is part of a hate group and has attacked a gay couple suggests that he might be projecting his own unacceptable homosexual feelings onto others. We might estimate that this raises the probability of projection to 50%.

It's important to note that these are estimated probabilities, based on the information given, and are subjective. However, based on the Bayesian inference process, projection seems to be the most likely defense mechanism at play.",N

She is also found to be pale with dry mucous membranes and generalized weakness of the proximal muscles. Her significant findings include pale conjunctivae, crusts along the veins of her left arm, a systolic ejection murmur, and a markedly low hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL. The crusts along the veins in her arm suggest intravenous drug use. Given her symptoms and presentation, this combination is highly suggestive of a condition called infectious endocarditis. The combination of anemia, possible intravenous drug use, and the presence of a murmur (suggesting valvular disease) strongly point to this diagnosis. The reticulocyte count is high, indicating the body is responding to the anemia by producing more red blood cells. Endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users, often involves the tricuspid valve, which could account for the murmur heard along the right-upper sternal border.",N,Intravenous Drug Use Related Anemia,"This patient presents with a combination of symptoms: fatigue, pale conjunctivae, low blood pressure, tachycardia, and a heart murmur, all of which suggest anemia. The elevated reticulocyte count is consistent with this diagnosis, indicating that the body is attempting to produce more red blood cells to compensate for their loss. However, the occult blood test is negative, suggesting that the anemia is not caused by a gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient's history of working as a nurse and the presence of ""numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins"" are strong indicators of intravenous drug use, which could lead to recurrent blood loss, infections, and endocarditis.

Endocarditis can lead to a systolic ejection murmur as heard in this case, as well as a type of anemia known as anemia of chronic disease (also called anemia of inflammation). This is a type of anemia that can occur with long-term diseases that involve inflammation, infection, or malignancy, and in this case, could be due to recurrent infections from IV drug use. However, the high reticulocyte count goes against this form of anemia as it's usually normocytic with a low reticulocyte count.

Alternatively, the anemia could also be related to chronic blood loss due to the IV drug use, which would lead to iron deficiency anemia, a type of microcytic anemia. However, the MCV is normal in this case, so this is less likely.

Another possibility could be hemolytic anemia which is a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed and removed from the bloodstream before their usual lifespan is over. A high reticulocyte count is a sign of increased red blood cell production by the bone marrow, and is typically seen in hemolytic anemias.

The generalized weakness of the proximal muscles could also suggest some form of muscle disease, but the primary indicators in this case seem to point to anemia associated with IV drug use and possible endocarditis.",N,Intravenous Drug Abuse,"This patient's presentation of fatigue, pale conjunctivae, low blood pressure, high pulse rate, and low hemoglobin indicate anemia. Her elevated reticulocyte count indicates the body's response to this anemia, attempting to produce more red blood cells. The presence of crusts along her veins suggests repeated intravenous access, which, along with her occupation as a nurse, raises the possibility of self-administered injections and potential illicit substance use. Importantly, generalized weakness of the proximal muscles can indicate muscle damage or inflammation, which could be due to multiple causes, including autoimmune, infectious, or drug-induced myopathy. In the context of this patient's potential access to drugs and her anemia, her presentation might suggest a diagnosis of chronic intravenous drug use leading to drug-induced myopathy and secondary anemia.",N,Factitious disorder imposed on self,"The patient's signs and symptoms point towards chronic blood loss, which is not likely gastrointestinal due to the negative test for occult blood. The most telling symptom is the presence of crusts along the course of her left arm veins, which is indicative of self-induced injection of blood. This, combined with her fear of having cancer (despite no supportive diagnostic evidence), depression, and the high stress from work suggests a psychiatric disorder called factitious disorder imposed on self, formerly known as Munchausen Syndrome. This is a mental illness, in which a person repeatedly acts as if he or she has a physical or mental disorder when, in truth, he or she has caused the symptoms. The low hemoglobin and high reticulocyte count (body's response to anemia) support this theory. The murmur heard could be due to increased blood flow velocity due to anemia.",Y,Infectious endocarditis-induced hemolytic anemia,"Firstly, we need to identify the prior probabilities of conditions that may lead to the symptoms and signs described. There are several findings in this case: low hemoglobin, high reticulocyte count, pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, systolic ejection murmur, generalized weakness of proximal muscles, and a history of stress. Cancer, which the patient is worried about, does not seem to fit the symptoms well as she doesn't display symptoms typically associated with cancer (weight loss, organ-specific symptoms, positive stool occult blood, or findings on abdominal ultrasound).

The low hemoglobin (7.5 g/dL) and high reticulocyte count (13.3%) suggest a state of hemolysis, or rapid red blood cell destruction. The initial, or prior, probability for hemolytic anemia, which fits these lab findings, might be set at 50%.

The patient's pallor (pale conjunctivae and dry mucous membranes) further supports the idea of anemia, increasing the posterior probability of hemolytic anemia to around 70%.

The systolic ejection murmur could be associated with increased blood flow through the heart, which is seen in conditions of high demand, like hemolytic anemia. This raises the probability further to around 80%.

Generalized weakness and fatigue are common in anemia due to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, increasing the probability to 90%.

Finally, the crusts along the veins of her left arm could indicate intravenous drug use, which is known to be a potential cause of infectious endocarditis. Infectious endocarditis can cause hemolytic anemia due to mechanical destruction of red blood cells on the damaged heart valves, potentially bringing our probability to near certainty, say 95%.

Given the findings, it seems likely that the patient is dealing with hemolytic anemia, potentially secondary to infectious endocarditis.",N
"Five days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia while on a trip to Haiti, a 43-year-old woman develops low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. During the surgery, she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Three days after the surgery, she was stable enough to be transported back to the United States. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 138/76 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. Abdominal examination shows moderate tenderness over the liver. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""",Adverse effect of anesthetic,Acute viral hepatitis A,N,Hepatitis A,N,Hepatitis A,N,Hepatitis A,N,Hepatitis A,N,,Malaria infection,"This patient has undergone a recent surgical procedure with blood transfusion and now presents with symptoms of liver damage including jaundice, tenderness, and elevated liver enzymes. Given the history of transfusion, her symptoms could be due to a transfusion-transmitted infection. However, serology for common bloodborne pathogens (Hepatitis A, B, and C) is negative. The significant detail in this question is the setting - Haiti, which is an area endemic for diseases such as Malaria. It is plausible that she received a transfusion of blood contaminated with a malaria parasite. Post-transfusion malaria can present with the described symptoms including fever, vomiting, and hepatomegaly. Liver biopsy showing centrilobular necrosis is also consistent with severe malaria infection.",N,Hepatitis E infection,"The differential for this patient's condition includes: drug-induced liver injury, alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Given her recent medical history, one could first suspect drug-induced liver injury, possibly related to the anesthesia from the recent surgery. However, her anti-HAV IgG positive and anti-HAV IgM negative result indicates previous infection with hepatitis A, which isn't causing the current condition. Her HBsAg negative result indicates she's not currently infected with Hepatitis B, but Anti-HBs positive shows she's either been vaccinated or has recovered from a previous infection. Anti-HCV antibodies negative rules out Hepatitis C.

Alcoholic liver disease is unlikely as we don't have any information suggesting excessive alcohol consumption.

Autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and Wilson's disease would be less likely given the patient's age, lack of other systemic symptoms, and the acuteness of her presentation.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease usually occurs over a longer time period and in association with metabolic syndrome, which is not indicated in this scenario.

Finally, her recent travel to Haiti and the receipt of a blood transfusion there might suggest a bloodborne infection. Given her symptoms, an enlarged liver, and biopsy showing massive centrilobular necrosis, the most likely underlying cause could be an infection with Hepatitis E virus (HEV). This form of hepatitis is commonly transmitted through contaminated water or blood products in developing countries. The symptoms described, including jaundice, liver tenderness, and significantly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), are typical of acute viral hepatitis. This is confirmed by liver biopsy findings. Hepatitis E typically self-resolves and does not have a chronic form.",N,Hepatitis E,"This patient underwent a surgery and received a blood transfusion in Haiti and subsequently developed symptoms including fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice with hepatomegaly and raised liver enzymes. This is suggestive of acute hepatitis. The patient's hepatitis A serology shows she has had a previous infection (positive anti-HAV IgG) but does not have a current infection (negative anti-HAV IgM). She is also immune to hepatitis B (positive anti-HBs) and has not been exposed to hepatitis C (negative anti-HCV antibodies). Her symptoms started after receiving a blood transfusion in Haiti. This is suggestive of hepatitis E, which can be transmitted via contaminated blood products. Hepatitis E infection is common in developing countries and can cause an acute hepatitis syndrome. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is Hepatitis E.",N,Hepatitis E infection,"This patient recently received a blood transfusion in a country with potentially lower blood screening standards. She's now presenting with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, as well as abnormal liver enzymes. These symptoms are indicative of acute hepatitis. The absence of anti-HAV IgM rules out acute hepatitis A, and the negative HBsAg and anti-HCV antibodies rule out hepatitis B and C, respectively. Her blood was positive for anti-HAV IgG and Anti-HBs, indicating prior infection and/or vaccination against hepatitis A and B. The patient's liver biopsy showing massive centrilobular necrosis is typical in severe cases of acute viral hepatitis. Given her recent blood transfusion in a country with lower blood screening standards, the most likely cause of this acute hepatitis is a blood-borne pathogen, such as Hepatitis E (HEV), which is not typically screened for in many blood donation settings.",N,Drug-induced liver injury,"The prior probability of an infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) is approximately 1%. However, this patient's recent travel to Haiti, a region with higher prevalence of HAV, can increase the posterior probability to around 15%. Moreover, she underwent a surgery and received a blood transfusion, which can further increase the probability of a bloodborne infection to around 30%.

On the other hand, her anti-HAV IgG being positive while anti-HAV IgM being negative suggests that she had a past infection with HAV, not a recent one. This reduces the likelihood of HAV being the cause, bringing the probability back down to around 10%.

In contrast, her recent surgery and blood transfusion increase the likelihood of an infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV infection can also cause massive hepatic necrosis as seen on her liver biopsy. However, her HBsAg being negative and anti-HBs positive indicate she is immune to HBV due to past infection or vaccination, which significantly reduces the likelihood of HBV infection, bringing the probability back down to around 1%.

Her anti-HCV antibodies being negative rules out hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.

The findings of jaundice, liver tenderness, elevated liver enzymes, and especially the liver biopsy showing massive centrilobular necrosis are most consistent with a severe form of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The general anesthesia during her recent surgery in Haiti could be the offending agent. Assuming a prior probability of 5% for DILI, her recent anesthesia exposure can raise the probability to around 50%, while the biopsy findings can increase the likelihood further to 70%.

Therefore, based on Bayesian inference, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is drug-induced liver injury.",Y
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police. He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. As part of the patient’s initial workup, a head CT is performed which is unremarkable, and an arterial blood gas is performed as seen below:

pH: 7.29
PaCO2: 95 mm Hg
PaO2: 70 mm Hg
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L

What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s current presentation?",Heroin,Drug overdose,Y,Drug overdose,Y,Drug overdose.,Y,Drug overdose,Y,Drug overdose,Y,,Drug Overdose,"This patient's presentation with a low pH (7.29), a high PaCO2 (95 mm Hg), and a normal bicarbonate level (24 mEq/L) indicates respiratory acidosis. The patient's history of polysubstance abuse and current unconscious state suggest a possible drug overdose, likely on a sedative or opiate, which can cause respiratory depression leading to carbon dioxide retention and subsequent respiratory acidosis.",Y,Drug Overdose,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include an overdose of a substance, traumatic injury, a psychiatric episode, or a metabolic issue. Given the presented arterial blood gas (ABG) results, we can see that the patient is suffering from respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PaCO2), suggesting an issue with alveolar ventilation. In the context of his history of polysubstance abuse, this could be due to an overdose of a substance like an opioid, benzodiazepine, or barbiturate, which are known to depress respiratory centers in the brain, leading to hypoventilation and consequently high carbon dioxide (hypercapnia).

Trauma, while initially a concern due to the reported bruises and the fact that the patient was found unconscious outside a bar, is less likely given the unremarkable CT scan. A primary metabolic disorder is also less likely because the bicarbonate level is normal, indicating that the kidneys are likely functioning properly in acid-base balance. A psychiatric episode wouldn't usually cause the respiratory depression seen in the ABG results. Thus, after considering the context, the most likely etiology of this patient's current presentation is a drug overdose that led to respiratory depression.",Y,Drug Overdose,"The arterial blood gas (ABG) findings in this patient reveal a low pH (indicating acidosis), a high PaCO2 (indicating hypercapnia), and a normal bicarbonate level. These findings suggest a primary respiratory acidosis, most likely due to hypoventilation. The etiology of hypoventilation in this case could be multifactorial, but a likely scenario given his past medical history of polysubstance abuse, is a drug overdose (such as opioids or benzodiazepines) which can depress the central nervous system and cause hypoventilation.",Y,Drug overdose,"The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a severe respiratory acidosis (lowered pH and elevated PaCO2) suggesting the patient is not effectively eliminating carbon dioxide from his body. Given the clinical context, there are several possible reasons for this, such as respiratory depression from substance abuse, potential aspiration or suffocation during an episode of unconsciousness, or even a suicide attempt involving drugs that depress the respiratory center in the brain. The patient's history of polysubstance abuse and multiple suicide attempts lends additional weight to the possibility of drug overdose. The bruises could be unrelated to the primary etiology and be a consequence of physical trauma due to unconsciousness and fall. The unremarkable head CT rules out significant traumatic brain injury. The absence of metabolic compensation (normal bicarbonate) suggests an acute event.",Y,Drug overdose,"This patient has a decreased pH (7.29), a significantly increased PaCO2 (95 mm Hg), and a normal bicarbonate level (24 mEq/L), suggesting respiratory acidosis. Given the scenario, we know that the patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse. This raises the prior probability of a drug overdose, potentially from opiates or benzodiazepines, which can depress the respiratory system, leading to respiratory acidosis. Let's consider this using Bayesian inference:

The prior probability of a drug overdose in the general population is quite low, let's say 1%. However, this patient has a history of polysubstance abuse which would raise the posterior probability to about 30%. The patient's depressed mental status would further increase the probability to 60%. The fact that the patient has an unexplained respiratory acidosis pushes the probability of drug overdose higher, say to 80%. Finally, the scenario of being found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a bar could also be compatible with drug abuse, leading us to a final posterior probability estimate of 90%. Hence, this patient's presentation is most likely due to a drug overdose.",Y

His age (6-month-old) and the fact that his symptoms were not present at birth but have developed over time point towards a progressive disorder. Furthermore, the fact that this is a generalized problem affecting both upper and lower extremities and that he has a bell-shaped chest suggest that this may be a systemic disorder affecting his motor neurons. The most likely diagnosis given these findings is spinal muscular atrophy, which is a genetic disorder that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle wasting and weakness.",Y,Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes cerebral palsy, myopathies, congenital myasthenia gravis, and anterior horn cell diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the onset of symptoms, the age of the patient, and the particular signs and symptoms suggest a specific diagnosis.

The early age onset, progressive weakness, difficulty with motor tasks such as rolling over and sitting, weak cry and suck, bell-shaped chest due to diaphragmatic breathing (a characteristic sign of this condition), and diminished deep tendon reflexes are consistent with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord, leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. The fact that this child has normal cranial nerve findings (able to smile, furrow his brow, and has intact extraocular movements) helps differentiate SMA from other conditions as it usually spares the facial and ocular muscles.",Y,Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"This infant has hypotonia (difficulty rolling over, weak cry and suck), respiratory insufficiency (bell-shaped chest indicating use of accessory muscles), intact facial movements, and decreased deep tendon reflexes.

Onset is usually within the first few months of life.",Y,Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"This child is presenting with progressive muscular weakness, hypotonia, a weak cry and suck, and diminished deep tendon reflexes, which are classic symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and bulbar region of the brain. The bell-shaped chest seen in the patient is also indicative of SMA as this abnormality occurs due to muscle weakness, leading to an inability to move the chest with respiration. This condition is caused by a mutation in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, which leads to decreased levels of SMN protein, essential for the survival of motor neurons.",Y,Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"The prior probability of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is around 1 in 10,000 live births.

Benign thyroid nodules are common, but they do not typically present with cervical lymphadenopathy. Thyroiditis can cause swelling of the thyroid, but it is typically painful and often associated with systemic symptoms. Parathyroid adenomas usually do not cause visible or palpable neck masses. Lymphoma could cause a neck mass and cervical lymphadenopathy, but it would typically involve other systems or generalized lymphadenopathy. The presence of painless cervical lymphadenopathy, a solitary, vascular thyroid nodule with potential calcifications on ultrasound, and the nature of its growth over three months are most indicative of thyroid cancer.

The key to his diagnosis lies in the recent travel history to Arizona and the finding of necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the lung biopsy. These findings are typical of an infection with Coccidioides immitis, a dimorphic fungus endemic to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona, where it resides in the soil. When inhaled, the fungus transforms from a mycelial form to a spherule form in the lung, causing pneumonia (coccidioidomycosis), often referred to as ""Valley Fever"".

This fungal infection is known as Coccidioidomycosis, often colloquially referred to as ""valley fever"".",Y,Coccidioidomycosis,"This patient presents with symptoms of cough, joint pain, malaise, and fever along with an exposure history of a hiking trip around Phoenix, Arizona. His chest CT shows an irregular opacity, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy. Importantly, the lung biopsy results reveal granulomatous inflammation with spherules filled with endospores, which is characteristic of Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii infection. These fungi are endemic to the Southwestern United States (including Arizona) and can cause a systemic infection known as coccidioidomycosis or ""valley fever"". Clinical manifestations often include pulmonary symptoms (like this patient's cough and abnormal lung findings), as well as systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and arthralgia. The infection can also cause erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme, but these are not present in this patient. The presence of granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in lung tissue is pathognomonic for Coccidioides infection.
",Y,Coccidioidomycosis,"In this Bayesian inference approach, we start with a prior probability and adjust it based on the new information from the case.

The patient has recently traveled to Arizona and presents with chronic cough, fever, malaise, joint pains, and a lung mass-like lesion. He also has an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggesting an ongoing inflammatory process.

The prior probability of a common pulmonary condition like pneumonia might be relatively high, say 30%. However, his travel history to the desert region of Arizona significantly alters the probabilities, increasing the probability of fungal infection like coccidioidomycosis, which is endemic in that region, from a prior probability of 5% to a posterior probability of 30%.

The presence of a lung mass (especially an irregular one) can often suggest malignancy. But in the context of his symptoms and travel history, an infectious granuloma becomes more likely, increasing the probability of coccidioidomycosis further to 50%.

The presence of necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores on histology is classic for coccidioidomycosis, raising the posterior probability to nearly 100%. The negative acid-fast stain helps exclude other granulomatous diseases like tuberculosis, reinforcing our diagnosis.

Therefore, taking into account the Bayesian approach and the information presented, this patient likely has pulmonary coccidioidomycosis.",Y

The laboratory results show that she has liver damage, as indicated by the elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and bilirubin. Furthermore, her prothrombin time is prolonged, which can occur in severe liver disease as the liver produces many of the clotting factors. Most of the common causes of liver injury, such as autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis (CMV, EBV), and HIV, have been ruled out by negative antibody tests. Given her history of recent travel to Sudan, a region endemic for malaria, this patient's symptoms may suggest a diagnosis of severe malaria. Malaria can cause liver damage and induce a hemolytic anemia, which could explain her elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and somewhat decreased hemoglobin. Moreover, in pregnancy, women are more susceptible to the severe effects of malaria, including hepatic dysfunction. Therefore, a test for malaria parasites, such as a peripheral blood smear, would be the most likely to confirm the diagnosis.",N,Hepatitis E serology,"The differential diagnoses in this patient include various forms of hepatitis, including alcoholic, drug-induced, autoimmune, and viral hepatitis. Given her recent travel history to Sudan, viral hepatitis, especially Hepatitis A and E, which are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, become the most likely possibilities. Her symptoms of lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice also suggest hepatitis. Furthermore, the very high aminotransferase levels (AST and ALT) indicate acute hepatocellular injury, which is typical in viral hepatitis. The fact that anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are negative makes autoimmune hepatitis unlikely. Negative anti-CMV and anti-EBV also rule out cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus as causes. Her pregnancy and travel to an endemic area make Hepatitis E an important consideration, as it can cause severe disease in pregnant women.

Hence, the correct diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis in this case would be a serologic test to detect Hepatitis E virus antibodies (anti-HEV IgM and IgG).",Y,Hepatitis E serology,"This pregnant patient's presentation of fever, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, jaundice, asterixis, and markedly elevated transaminases after travel to Sudan is concerning for viral hepatitis, most likely hepatitis E (HEV). Hepatitis E is an RNA virus transmitted feco-orally, particularly in endemic areas through contaminated water. It's usually self-limited but can lead to fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women, particularly in the second and third trimesters. The other causes of hepatitis (e.g., autoimmunity, EBV, CMV, HIV) have been ruled out by negative serology, and she did not have a blood transfusion (which could transmit Hepatitis C or B). Therefore, a serologic test for Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) would confirm the diagnosis.",Y,Hepatitis E serology,"The patient presents with symptoms such as lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. She also has significantly elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase), and a high prothrombin time, indicating impaired liver function. She has been traveling to Sudan recently, which increases the chance of exposure to endemic diseases. These signs and symptoms, together with her recent travel history, suggest a hepatotropic viral infection. The most common viral causes of hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, C, D, E. Given her travel history, Hepatitis E would be a strong possibility as it is endemic in many developing countries and is often associated with poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water. Additionally, Hepatitis E infection can be particularly severe in pregnant women, particularly in the second and third trimesters. The other viruses (CMV, EBV, and HIV) have been ruled out by negative serologies.",Y,Hepatitis B Test,"The initial step in Bayesian inference involves setting up a prior probability based on the patient's presentation and general population statistics. In this case, the woman presents with symptoms of liver damage (jaundice, high AST and ALT, and coagulopathy indicated by an elevated INR), which suggests a variety of possible liver conditions.

Given that the woman has recently returned from Sudan, we need to consider diseases prevalent in that region. Hepatitis B, for instance, is highly endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it can cause liver damage as seen in this patient. So, let's assign a prior probability of 20% to acute Hepatitis B infection.

Next, the patient's presentation allows us to update our prior probability. The patient has extremely high AST and ALT, and her INR is also elevated. These findings increase our posterior probability of Hepatitis B infection to perhaps 50%.

Next, consider that the patient has no apparent autoimmune or other viral causes for liver damage, based on the negative ANA, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and negative anti-CMV and anti-EBV results. These negative results further increase our posterior probability of Hepatitis B infection, let's say to 70%.

Finally, given her recent travel history to Sudan, a region with high Hepatitis B prevalence, our posterior probability for Hepatitis B infection increases to 85%.

Considering the findings, it's likely that this patient has acute Hepatitis B infection. The best confirmatory test would be testing for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or testing for Hepatitis B core IgM antibody, which is present in acute infection.",N
"A 70-year-old obese male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and cough of sudden onset. The patient states that his symptoms came on while he was sleeping. The patient has a past medical history of type II diabetes and is currently taking lisinopril, metformin, insulin, and fish oil. On physical exam, you note bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). An EKG and chest radiographs are obtained (Figures A and B). The patient is started on BIPAP and medical therapy and his symptoms improve rapidly. Lab values are as follows.

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/L
K+: 3.2 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 31 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 120 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.9 mg/dL

What is the best explanation of this patient's current presentation?",Hydrochlorothiazide,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,,Congestive heart failure,"The patient presents with sudden onset shortness of breath and cough while sleeping, bipedal edema, and jugular venous distention (JVD). These symptoms suggest fluid overload or congestive symptoms, which are common in heart failure. BIPAP and medical therapy are also used to manage heart failure, particularly in acute exacerbation. Furthermore, HCO3- is high, which may indicate the body's compensatory response to retain bicarbonate in the presence of chronic respiratory acidosis, often seen in patients with long-standing heart failure. Also, while not specifically mentioned, the EKG and chest radiograph would likely show further signs of heart failure.",N,Heart failure exacerbation,"The symptoms of the patient in this case, including sudden onset shortness of breath and cough, bipedal edema, and jugular venous distention (JVD), are indicative of cardiovascular disease. The main conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis here are heart failure, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, and kidney disease.

Given the patient's history of type II diabetes and obesity, and the symptoms presented, heart failure is high on the differential. The improvement of symptoms after the initiation of BIPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) and medical therapy further supports this, as these treatments are typically effective for heart failure. Pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction would likely cause more acute symptoms and wouldn't show such a fast response to BIPAP and medical therapy.

Looking at the lab values, the patient has normal serum electrolytes, kidney function, and glucose levels, with a slightly low potassium level (hypokalemia). However, the elevated bicarbonate level (HCO3-) could indicate the presence of metabolic alkalosis, which can be associated with diuretic use, a common treatment for heart failure. These findings do not support a diagnosis of kidney disease.

Taken together, the clinical presentation and response to treatment strongly suggest that the patient is experiencing an exacerbation of heart failure, likely due to volume overload given the presence of edema and JVD. This might have been triggered by poor medication adherence, dietary indiscretion (high salt intake), or a concurrent illness such as a respiratory infection or arrhythmia.",N,Acute Decompensated Heart Failure,"This 70-year-old obese male with a history of type II diabetes presents with sudden onset shortness of breath, bipedal edema, and JVD. His symptoms, along with the rapid improvement following treatment with BIPAP and medical therapy, suggest acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). ADHF may occur when there is a sudden change in the heart's ability to pump. The rapid onset of symptoms (e.g., dyspnea, orthopnea, fatigue) and signs of volume overload (e.g., edema, JVD) are characteristic. The improvement of symptoms with BIPAP, which can assist with oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing, and medical management further supports this diagnosis. His metabolic panel does not show any severe electrolyte disturbances or renal failure that could suggest other causes for his presentation.",N,Congestive Heart Failure,"The patient's presentation of sudden onset shortness of breath and cough, bipedal edema, and jugular venous distension are all signs of congestive heart failure (CHF). This condition results in the heart's decreased ability to pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup, often in the lungs (pulmonary edema) and peripheral tissues. It's often worsened by lying down or sleeping, which matches this patient's history. This patient's use of BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) and rapid improvement with medical therapy further supports this, as these interventions help alleviate the symptoms of fluid overload in the lungs. His elevated HCO3- could be a compensatory mechanism for respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation in CHF. His low potassium (K+) could be the result of diuretic use, a common treatment for CHF to help reduce fluid overload.",N,Congestive Heart Failure,"The prior probability of heart failure in a 70-year-old obese male with diabetes is considerably high, although an exact percentage is not readily available. The presence of bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD) on physical exam further increase this probability. Both of these signs are often seen in congestive heart failure (CHF) due to fluid overload and increased pressure in the venous system. The sudden onset of shortness of breath and cough during sleep is suggestive of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which is also a common symptom of heart failure. The patient's rapid response to BIPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) and medical therapy, which is typical for acute exacerbations of heart failure, further increases the probability. Finally, the serum bicarbonate level (HCO3-) of 31 mEq/L indicates metabolic alkalosis, which is often seen in patients with heart failure due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, considering all these factors, the posterior probability of heart failure is very high in this patient.",N
"A previously healthy 60-year-old man comes to his physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,COPD,Y,COPD,Y,COPD,Y,COPD,Y,COPD,Y,,Emphysema,"This patient presents with symptoms of chronic, progressive shortness of breath, dry cough, and no fever, chills or night sweats. The patient also has a long history of smoking, which increases the risk of lung diseases. The physical examination reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing, which are often seen in obstructive lung diseases. His spirometry results also support this. The FEV1:FVC ratio is less than 70%, which indicates airway obstruction. The decreased FEV1 further suggests airflow obstruction. The elevated total lung capacity indicates hyperinflation of the lungs, which is a feature of emphysema. The decreased DLCO, which measures how well oxygen passes from the air sacs of the lungs into the blood, is commonly reduced in emphysema. Collectively, these findings are most consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more specifically emphysema.",Y,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"The differential for this patient includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiectasis, and pulmonary fibrosis. Considering the patient's long history of cigarette smoking and the absence of other symptomatology, COPD becomes a strong contender. He has symptoms of progressive dyspnea and a dry cough, consistent with COPD. The physical examination findings of a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing are typical for obstructive lung disease. This is confirmed by spirometry showing an FEV1:FVC ratio of less than 70% which is diagnostic of an obstructive pattern, and his FEV1 is 60% of predicted which indicates moderate severity. His total lung capacity is 125% of predicted, which suggests hyperinflation of the lungs, a common feature in emphysema, a component of COPD. The reduced DLCO indicates impaired gas transfer, which is more consistent with emphysema rather than chronic bronchitis. Hence, in the context of the patient's history and examination findings, COPD (specifically emphysema) is the most likely diagnosis.",Y,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"The patient's 40-year history of smoking and current symptoms, including a chronic, progressive shortness of breath, dry cough, and no fever, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The spirometry findings of a reduced FEV1:FVC ratio (normally above 70% in healthy adults) and increased total lung capacity are indicative of an obstructive lung disease. The decrease in DLCO indicates a decreased efficiency in gas exchange, commonly seen in emphysema, a type of COPD. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is COPD, probably of the emphysema subtype.",Y,Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"This patient presents with progressively worsening shortness of breath, a dry cough, and a significant history of smoking, all suggestive of a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Lung auscultation findings of prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing also support this diagnosis. The spirometry results further support the diagnosis of COPD: the decreased FEV1:FVC ratio (<70%) indicates an obstructive pattern, the decreased FEV1 (<80% of predicted) points towards severity of airflow limitation, and increased total lung capacity (>120% of predicted) suggests hyperinflation, often seen in emphysema, a subtype of COPD. The decreased diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is seen in emphysema due to destruction of alveolar walls leading to decreased surface area for gas exchange.",Y,Emphysema,"Step 1: The prior probability for a smoking-related lung disease in a long-term smoker is high. Among these, we consider Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer primarily.

Step 2: The presence of progressive shortness of breath and a dry cough, along with the absence of fever, chills, or night sweats, leans towards COPD. Lung cancer often presents with systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss, not evident here. This information increases the posterior probability of COPD.

Step 3: Lung auscultation shows a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. These are characteristic signs of COPD, which further increase its posterior probability.

Step 4: Spirometry results are crucial. An FEV1:FVC ratio of less than 70% indicates obstructive disease, confirming our suspicion of COPD. An increased total lung capacity suggests hyperinflation, a feature of emphysema, which is a type of COPD. The decreased diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is also consistent with emphysema, where the destruction of alveolar walls impairs gas exchange. All these findings considerably increase the probability of COPD, specifically emphysema.",Y
"An 8-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, as shown. These lesions occur intermittently but have worsened over time. Her medical history is remarkable for iron deficiency, for which she is on ferrous sulfate. The patient has also experienced intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea, previously diagnosed as lactose intolerance. Her height is at the 30th percentile and weight is at the 25th percentile for age and sex. An immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",Celiac disease,Celiac disease,Y,Celiac disease,Y,Celiac disease,Y,Celiac disease,Y,Celiac disease,Y,,Celiac disease,"The child in question presents with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, which suggests a skin condition that's associated with itching. She also has a medical history of iron deficiency, episodes of mild diarrhea, previously diagnosed as lactose intolerance, and her height and weight percentiles are relatively low, indicating potential malnourishment. Additionally, her IgA tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal. High levels of IgA tissue transglutaminase antibodies are commonly associated with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder where the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. It can cause skin conditions like dermatitis herpetiformis, iron deficiency due to malabsorption, and gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea. Given these symptoms and lab findings, this patient most likely has celiac disease.",Y,Celiac disease,"The differential for this patient includes: allergic contact dermatitis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and dermatitis herpetiformis. Allergic contact dermatitis would typically be localized to areas of contact with allergens, which is not necessarily indicated here. Psoriasis usually presents with well-defined plaques with silvery scale, which doesn't exactly fit with the symptoms described. Eczema could present with intensely pruritic lesions, but is usually associated with a personal or family history of allergies or asthma. The patient's symptoms along with her history of iron deficiency, lactose intolerance, and elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer are most indicative of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is associated with celiac disease.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a skin manifestation of celiac disease, characterized by intensely pruritic vesicles and papules, typically on extensor surfaces. The gastrointestinal symptoms, growth disturbances (evidenced by her relatively low height and weight percentiles), and iron deficiency are also common findings in celiac disease. The elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titer is a key diagnostic test for celiac disease. Therefore, her condition is most likely due to celiac disease.",Y,Celiac disease,"This child has several signs suggestive of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition that results from an inappropriate immune response to dietary gluten. It is characterized by small intestinal villous atrophy, leading to malabsorption. This can explain her iron deficiency, mild diarrhea, and low height and weight percentiles. Furthermore, the intense itching and rash on the buttocks is suggestive of dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin manifestation of celiac disease. Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by intensely pruritic papules and vesicles typically distributed symmetrically on extensor surfaces. The diagnosis of celiac disease is further supported by the elevated tissue transglutaminase IgA titer, which is a highly sensitive and specific test for celiac disease.",Y,Celiac disease,"The prior probability of celiac disease in the general population is around 1%. The patient's IgA tissue transglutaminase titer, a sensitive and specific marker for celiac disease, is five times the upper limit of normal, which increases the posterior probability of celiac disease to about 90%. The patient's history of intermittent diarrhea, a common symptom of celiac disease, further increases the probability to 95%. The lesions on her buttocks can be indicative of dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin manifestation of celiac disease, which further raises the probability to near certainty. Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is celiac disease.",Y
"A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of diarrhea, moderate abdominal pain, and weakness. Her symptoms began on the return flight from a 2-week yoga retreat in India, where she stayed at a resort. She was mildly nauseous as she boarded the flight, and diarrhea followed immediately after eating the in-flight meal. Since then, she has had up to five watery stools daily. She has a 1-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is allergic to shellfish. Her only medication is ranitidine. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. What is the most likely pathogen?",Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,Escherichia coli,Y,Bacterial infection,N,E. coli,Y,Bacterial gastroenteritis,N,Salmonella,N,,Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,"The patient presented with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness that started during her flight home from a yoga retreat in India. Given that the symptoms started after she ate the in-flight meal, it's reasonable to think that the meal could be the source of the problem. However, since she was in India where the hygiene may have been suboptimal, a common pathogen associated with travelers' diarrhea, particularly in developing regions, should also be considered. The most common cause of travelers' diarrhea is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which can cause sudden and severe symptoms. In addition, given her diffuse abdominal tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds, a bacterial pathogen is more likely than a viral one. Therefore, the most likely pathogen in this scenario is ETEC.",Y,Escherichia coli (ETEC),"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes infectious causes due to bacteria (e.g., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella), viruses (e.g., Norovirus, Rotavirus), and parasites (e.g., Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica). She could also have traveler's diarrhea, which is usually caused by bacteria (commonly E. coli). The symptom timeline suggests an acute infection rather than a chronic one, which is more likely with parasitic causes. Given the rapid onset of symptoms after consuming the in-flight meal, a foodborne pathogen is highly likely. While many pathogens can cause foodborne illness, the combination of her recent travel to a region with high risk of foodborne illness, the rapid onset of symptoms, and the type of symptoms she is experiencing suggest a bacterial cause. In particular, the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea, which typically presents with watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping, is enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC).",Y,Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC),"The patient's symptoms of acute onset diarrhea following consumption of an in-flight meal and recent travel to India are indicative of an infectious gastroenteritis. Given the acute onset of symptoms, a pathogen that produces a preformed toxin is likely. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens are all bacteria that produce preformed toxins and can cause symptoms in this timeframe. However, considering the fact that the patient was mildly nauseous before eating the in-flight meal, it is possible that she acquired the pathogen in India, where fecal-oral transmission of enteric pathogens due to poor sanitation is common. Among the common pathogens causing traveler's diarrhea, Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the most common and presents with watery diarrhea similar to this patient's symptoms.",Y,Staphylococcus aureus,"This patient's recent travel to India followed by the onset of diarrhea suggests that she may have acquired a travel-related infection, commonly referred to as ""traveler's diarrhea"". The most common causative agent of traveler's diarrhea worldwide is Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which typically causes symptoms within 10-14 days of infection. The second most common cause, particularly in travelers to South Asia, is Campylobacter jejuni. However, given the immediate onset of symptoms after eating the in-flight meal, it's also possible that she has a foodborne illness. In this case, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens could be the potential pathogens as they produce toxins causing rapid onset symptoms. Among these, Staphylococcus aureus is most frequently associated with food served on airplanes because it can produce toxins in food that isn't properly refrigerated. These toxins can cause symptoms to appear very quickly after consumption, typically within a few hours.",N,E. coli,"In our Bayesian inference, we start with a prior probability, then use the information given to revise this into a posterior probability. Traveler's diarrhea is a common condition affecting travelers, with a prior probability of 20%. The most common pathogens are E. coli (70% of cases), Campylobacter jejuni (5% of cases), Shigella spp. (3-5% of cases), and Salmonella spp. (1-2% of cases).

This patient's symptoms (diarrhea, abdominal pain, and lethargy) and recent travel to India suggest a possible case of traveler's diarrhea. So, considering the country she visited and the short incubation period (symptoms began shortly after her in-flight meal), the posterior probability of E. coli being the causative agent is elevated to 75%.

Moreover, the patient's symptoms seem to be mild to moderate, not severe (she has not been mentioned to have bloody diarrhea, severe dehydration, or fever), which is in line with what is typically caused by E. coli, further raising the posterior probability to 85%. Therefore, the most likely pathogen causing her symptoms is E. coli.",Y
"A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Serum calcium 6.7 mg/dL
Serum sodium 143 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.4 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Blood urea 16 mg/dL

Her laboratory results confirm hypocalcemia (serum calcium of 6.7 mg/dL; normal is about 8.5 - 10.2 mg/dL). The most likely cause of these findings is damage to or inadvertent removal of the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands regulate calcium levels in the body, and their removal or damage would lead to hypocalcemia.",Y,Hypoparathyroidism,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, and hypothyroidism. This patient has numbness around the mouth, paresthesia in the extremities, and latent tetany, which are all indicative of hypocalcemia. These symptoms, combined with the serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL, which is below the normal range of 8.5 - 10.2 mg/dL, confirm the diagnosis of hypocalcemia. This hypocalcemia is most likely due to accidental damage or removal of the parathyroid glands during the thyroidectomy, as they are located very close to the thyroid gland and may be damaged during the procedure. This would result in hypoparathyroidism, leading to decreased production of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels in the blood.",Y,Accidental Parathyroidectomy,"This patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and now presents with perioral numbness, paresthesia of the hands and feet, confusion, and anxiety. These are symptoms of hypocalcemia, which is further supported by the laboratory results showing a serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL (normal range: 8.5 - 10.2 mg/dL). In addition, the positive Trousseau sign (latent tetany/carpal spasm induced by a blood pressure cuff) is a classic clinical sign of hypocalcemia. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is accidental removal or injury to the parathyroid glands during thyroidectomy, leading to hypoparathyroidism and consequent hypocalcemia.",Y,Hypoparathyroidism,"This patient underwent total thyroidectomy, during which inadvertent removal or injury to the parathyroid glands may have occurred. The parathyroid glands regulate the calcium level in our bodies. If they are damaged or removed, it can lead to hypocalcemia, as evidenced by the patient's low serum calcium levels (6.7 mg/dL; normal range is usually around 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL). The symptoms of hypocalcemia can include perioral numbness, tingling sensations, paresthesias of hands and feet, confusion, and even carpal spasm (Trousseau's sign), which this patient is exhibiting. This condition is known as hypoparathyroidism, which often presents after thyroid surgery due to accidental removal or damage to the parathyroid glands.",Y,Parathyroid gland damage,"The initial prior probability of accidental parathyroid gland removal or damage during thyroidectomy is approximately 10%. The patient's symptoms of perioral numbness, tingling, and paresthesia of hands and feet increase the probability to around 40%, as these are common symptoms of hypocalcemia which can be caused by damage to the parathyroid glands. The physical examination finding of latent tetany (Trousseau's sign) is a classic sign of hypocalcemia, raising the probability to around 60%. Finally, the patient's low serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL further strengthens the likelihood of the hypothesis of parathyroid gland damage to about 80%. Given this chain of evidence, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is inadvertent parathyroid gland damage or removal during the thyroidectomy procedure.",Y
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by the police after a fall. The patient smells of alcohol and is slurring his words. You find out that he has recently been fired from his job as a salesperson for months of tardiness and poor performance. The police tell you that his girlfriend, who was there at the time of the fall, mentioned that the patient has been struggling with alcohol for at least a year. Upon physical examination, the patient becomes agitated and starts yelling. He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and says he couldn’t keep up sales percentages compared to someone using cocaine. What psychiatric defense mechanisms is the patient demonstrating?",Projection,Projection,Y,Projection,Y,Projection,Y,Displacement,N,Displacement,N,,Projection and Rationalization,"The patient's behavior can be analyzed using the concept of defense mechanisms, which are unconscious psychological strategies used by individuals to cope with reality or maintain self-image. Here, the patient is exhibiting two defense mechanisms.

Projection: The patient, who is struggling with alcoholism, is accusing his boss of being a cocaine addict. Projection is a defense mechanism where individuals attribute their unacceptable feelings or behaviors onto someone else. Here, the patient is dealing with his guilt and frustration about his own substance abuse issue by projecting it onto his boss.
Rationalization: The patient justifies his poor sales performance by comparing it to his boss who he accuses of using cocaine. Rationalization is a defense mechanism that involves explaining an unacceptable behavior or feeling in a rational or logical manner, avoiding the true reasons for the behavior. He's using this to justify his job loss rather than accepting that it was due to his tardiness and poor performance, potentially associated with his alcohol use.",Y,"Denial, Projection, Rationalization","The patient is exhibiting several defense mechanisms that can be identified: denial, projection, and rationalization. Denial, as he is unable to accept his own problematic alcohol use as indicated by his loss of job and police involvement. Projection, as he is attributing his own cocaine use to his boss rather than admitting to it himself. Lastly, rationalization, as he is providing excuses for his tardiness and poor performance by blaming it on his boss's supposed cocaine use rather than taking responsibility for his actions.",Y,Denial and Projection,"This patient is demonstrating two different defense mechanisms. The first is denial, which is the refusal to accept reality or fact, acting as if a painful event, thought, or feeling did not exist. He is denying his own alcohol problem by not acknowledging it as the cause of his recent job loss and problems. The second defense mechanism is projection, where individuals attribute their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, and motives to another person. The patient is projecting his own substance use onto his ex-boss, accusing him of using cocaine.",Y,Projection and Rationalization,"The patient is using two types of defense mechanisms. First, he is projecting by attributing his own substance misuse issues onto his ex-boss. Projection is when an individual ascribes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses onto another person. In this case, the patient is dealing with alcohol misuse and accuses his ex-boss of having a cocaine problem, thus externalizing his own struggle with substance abuse. Secondly, the patient is using rationalization, another defense mechanism, by providing a socially acceptable reason (not being able to keep up with a supposed cocaine user's sales percentages) for his job loss instead of the real reason (his alcohol misuse leading to tardiness and poor performance).",Y,"Projection, Rationalization","The patient is showing signs of two defense mechanisms: Projection and Rationalization. The prior probability of each of these defense mechanisms is around 10% in individuals with substance abuse problems.

Firstly, the patient accuses his boss of being a cocaine addict. This accusation, given the context and lack of evidence, suggests projection - attributing one's unacceptable thoughts or behaviors to another person. Projection as a defense mechanism increases the posterior probability to 40%.

Secondly, he rationalizes his poor work performance by comparing his sales percentages to those of his allegedly cocaine-addicted boss. This is a form of rationalization, where the individual tries to justify his actions with plausible but incorrect reasons. The presence of rationalization increases the posterior probability to 60%.

So, with both of these defense mechanisms observed in the patient's behavior, we can say that he is demonstrating both Projection and Rationalization.",Y
"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a progressive development of tender breast tissue over the past 18 months. He used to ride his bicycle for exercise 4 times a week but stopped after he had an accident and injured his left testicle 3 months ago. He has gained 5 kg (11 lb) during this period. For the last 10 years, he drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. He occasionally takes pantoprazole for heartburn. He is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis; transillumination test is negative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",Leydig cell tumor,Klinefelter Syndrome,N,Hormone imbalance,N,Klinefelter Syndrome,N,Hormone imbalance,N,Klinefelter syndrome,N,,"Rationale: This 32-year-old man presents with gynecomastia, which is the development of breast tissue in males. There are several factors to consider in this patient's history that could contribute to gynecomastia. First, he has gained weight, and obesity is known to be associated with gynecomastia due to increased conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue. Second, the patient has been consuming alcohol, and alcohol can increase aromatization of androgens to estrogens. Third, the patient has a mass in the left testicle, which could potentially be a tumor affecting the hormonal balance. The history of trauma to the testicle and the finding of a non-transilluminating mass is highly suggestive of a testicular tumor. Testicular tumors, especially Leydig cell tumors, can produce estrogen leading to gynecomastia.",Answer: Testicular tumor,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this 32-year-old man with gynecomastia includes: hormonal imbalance, medication side effects, alcohol consumption, obesity, and testicular tumors. His history reveals several factors that might contribute to his gynecomastia. He has gained weight, which can lead to an increase in estrogen production as adipose tissue can convert androgens to estrogens. His alcohol consumption, especially with beer, can also contribute as alcohol can increase the conversion of androgens to estrogens and beer contains phytoestrogens. He is also on pantoprazole which is very rarely associated with gynecomastia. However, an important finding is the nontender 1.5-cm mass in his left testis. A testicular mass, especially with a history of trauma, could indicate a testicular tumor, which can produce estrogen and lead to gynecomastia. Given the presence of a testicular mass, his recent history of trauma to the testicle, and the progressive nature of his gynecomastia, the most likely underlying cause is a testicular tumor.",Answer: Testicular tumor,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes hormonal imbalance due to various causes such as obesity, alcohol consumption, testicular tumor, drug side effect, or hypogonadism. This patient has several factors contributing to his gynecomastia. Firstly, he has gained weight and has a BMI of 30 kg/m2, which is classified as obese. Obesity can lead to increased peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens, which might contribute to the development of gynecomastia. Secondly, he has a history of chronic alcohol consumption. Alcohol can increase aromatization of testosterone to estradiol and reduce testosterone production by the testes. However, the most concerning finding is a non-transilluminating 1.5-cm mass in the left testis. This is likely to be a testicular tumor, which can produce estrogen leading to gynecomastia. Given the timing of the gynecomastia and the physical findings, it's highly likely that the testicular mass is contributing significantly to the gynecomastia.",Answer: Testicular tumor,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a 32-year-old male presenting with bilateral gynecomastia, which is characterized by enlargement of breast tissue. Gynecomastia can be caused by various factors, including hormonal imbalances, medication use, or underlying health conditions. The patient has gained weight, which is associated with increased conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue, contributing to gynecomastia. Additionally, the patient has a history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol can interfere with the liver's ability to break down estrogen, leading to increased estrogen levels, which can also contribute to gynecomastia. Importantly, the patient has a nontender mass in his left testis, which did not transilluminate, making the possibility of a testicular tumor more likely. Testicular tumors, particularly those producing hCG, can cause increased aromatization of androgens to estrogens, contributing to gynecomastia. Given the combination of weight gain, alcohol consumption, and the presence of a testicular mass, it is likely that this patient's gynecomastia is due to a combination of factors with the testicular mass being the most concerning and probable underlying cause.",Answer: Testicular tumor,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with bilateral gynecomastia, which can be caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. There are several factors to consider in this patient's case that could be contributing to this hormonal imbalance. Firstly, the patient has gained weight and has a BMI indicative of obesity. Adipose tissue can convert androgens into estrogens, which can lead to increased levels of circulating estrogen. Additionally, his alcohol consumption can also play a role. Chronic alcohol use is known to decrease testosterone levels and increase the conversion of androgens to estrogens in the liver. Another important factor in this case is the testicular injury he had 3 months ago. The presence of a non-tender mass in the left testis with a negative transillumination test suggests that it could be a testicular tumor. Testicular tumors can secrete human chorionic gonadotropin, which can stimulate breast tissue and cause gynecomastia. In this scenario, the combination of obesity, alcohol use, and a possible testicular tumor could be contributing to the hormonal imbalance leading to the development of gynecomastia.",Answer: Hormonal Imbalance,N
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Borderline personality disorder,Postpartum depression,N,Acute psychiatric emergency,N,Self-harm,N,Acute stress reaction,N,Postpartum psychosis,N,,"Rationale: This 22-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain, contractions, and bloody vaginal discharge. She is 10 weeks pregnant according to her last appointment. The physical exam showed an open cervix with bloody vaginal discharge, which is indicative of a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. Additionally, the patient exhibits extreme mood swings from gratitude to anger and aggression, followed by self-harm and destructive behavior. Considering her history of substance abuse and anxiety, and the rapid fluctuation in her mood, this behavior suggests a possible underlying mental health disorder. The sudden, intense change in mood and impulsivity, in particular, points towards Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) as a likely diagnosis.",Answer: Borderline Personality Disorder,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), an ectopic pregnancy, normal pregnancy with breakthrough bleeding, or a molar pregnancy. The presence of abdominal pain, contractions, and bloody vaginal discharge with an open cervix indicates that a spontaneous abortion is likely. However, the focus of this question seems to be on the patient's sudden change in behavior, from gratitude to extreme anger and aggression, followed by self-harm and destruction of property. This differential for her behavior includes normal grief, adjustment disorder, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, or an acute stress reaction. The patient�s rapid fluctuation in emotions, the intensity of her anger, and the impulsive destructive behavior suggests that this is more than normal grief. The history of substance abuse further supports that this patient may have an underlying psychiatric disorder. Of the options, Borderline Personality Disorder is known for rapid changes in mood, intense anger, and impulsive self-harm.",Answer: Borderline Personality Disorder,Y,"Rationale: The patient presented with abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge while being 10 weeks pregnant. Physical examination revealed an open cervix, which is indicative of a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. The patient�s drastic shift in behavior, from extreme gratitude to anger and aggression towards the medical staff, as well as self-harm and destructive behavior, is suggestive of a personality disorder, most likely Borderline Personality Disorder. Individuals with Borderline Personality Disorder often have a history of unstable relationships and can exhibit extreme mood swings, impulsivity, and self-harming behavior. The patient's history of substance abuse and anxiety are also associated with Borderline Personality Disorder.",Answer: Borderline Personality Disorder,Y,"Rationale: This 22-year-old woman initially presented with symptoms suggestive of a miscarriage, including abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. The physical exam findings, especially the open cervix and bloody discharge, confirm the spontaneous abortion. The patient's emotional response is initially positive but takes a sudden turn to anger and aggression toward the medical staff after learning of the miscarriage. This abrupt change in emotions is followed by self-harming behavior (lacerations over wrists) and destruction of property (broken medical equipment). This pattern of unstable interpersonal relationships, emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, and self-injury is characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD). It is worth noting that individuals with BPD are often highly sensitive to rejection and loss, which can trigger intense episodes of anger, depression, and anxiety.",Answer: Borderline Personality Disorder,Y,"Rationale: Starting with the prior probability, borderline personality disorder in the general population has a prevalence of about 1.6%. This patient is a young female, which is the demographic in which borderline personality disorder is more common, increasing the posterior probability slightly. She has a past medical history of substance abuse, which is associated with borderline personality disorder, and this increases the posterior probability further. The patient�s rapid change in demeanor from being extremely grateful to intensely angry is characteristic of the unstable relationships and intense emotional responses seen in borderline personality disorder, further increasing the probability. Lastly, the self-harm in the form of new lacerations on her wrists after receiving bad news is also a common characteristic of borderline personality disorder. Taking all this information into account, the probability that this patient has borderline personality disorder becomes significantly high.",Answer: Borderline personality disorder,Y
"A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sarcoidosis,Valley fever,N,Valley fever,N,Valley Fever,N,Valley fever,N,Valley Fever,N,,"Rationale: The 27-year-old woman is presenting with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain. She has recently traveled to Arizona and is originally from Nigeria. Her symptoms started after her trip to Arizona. The presence of ciliary injection and photophobia in her left eye suggests ocular involvement. Additionally, she has been experiencing symptoms that are affecting her ability to perform daily activities and she works in a geology laboratory. Taking into consideration her symptoms, travel history, and occupation, this suggests the possibility of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs and often affects the lungs, skin, and eyes. It has a higher prevalence in individuals of African descent and can have varied presentations. Shortness of breath and cough are indicative of lung involvement. The eye symptoms suggest ocular sarcoidosis. Furthermore, the mention of her working in a geology laboratory may imply exposure to various dusts or substances that could have triggered her symptoms.",Answer: Sarcoidosis,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this 27-year-old woman includes infections such as tuberculosis or fungal infections (considering her travel history and the fact that she was in Arizona), autoimmune conditions such as sarcoidosis, and connective tissue diseases like lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

Her symptoms of increasing shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain are indicative of a systemic process. Additionally, her recent travel to Arizona raises suspicion for fungal infections like coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever), which can cause pneumonia-like symptoms. Furthermore, her exposure as a research assistant in a geology lab might have exposed her to airborne fungi.

Another clue in this presentation is the patient�s left eye showing ciliary injection and photophobia. This could indicate uveitis, which is associated with sarcoidosis, but can also be seen in other conditions like tuberculosis or lupus.

However, considering the combination of respiratory symptoms, joint pain, and eye involvement without any mention of rash, and her exposure history (travel to Arizona and working in a geology laboratory), the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is known for its non-caseating granulomas which can affect multiple organ systems including the lungs, joints, and eyes. The chest x-ray, if it shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, would also support this diagnosis.",Answer: Sarcoidosis,Y,"Rationale: The 27-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, bilateral ankle pain, and has recently traveled to Arizona. She also exhibits ciliary injection and photophobia in her left eye. The fact that she works in a geology laboratory and recently visited Arizona is significant. Arizona is a region endemic for coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection also known as Valley Fever, which primarily affects the lungs and can cause symptoms similar to those of pneumonia. It is often associated with soil and dust. Additionally, her symptoms of ciliary injection and photophobia suggest ocular inflammation, which can also be a manifestation of coccidioidomycosis. The combination of respiratory symptoms, ocular inflammation, and exposure history make coccidioidomycosis the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Coccidioidomycosis,N,"Rationale: The patient is presenting with shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain. She also has ciliary injection and photophobia in the left eye. These symptoms suggest inflammation and are characteristic of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that commonly affects the lungs and lymph nodes but can also affect the eyes and joints. The fact that the patient works in a geology laboratory could also imply exposure to dust or minerals that can be associated with the development of sarcoidosis. Additionally, the patient has a history of travel, including visits to Nigeria and Arizona, which are areas known for several respiratory infections. However, her symptoms have been present for 2 months, which is more consistent with a chronic condition like sarcoidosis than an acute infection. Lastly, her oxygen saturation is 94% which is slightly low, indicating some level of respiratory involvement, which is consistent with pulmonary sarcoidosis.",Answer: Sarcoidosis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Sarcoidosis in a person of African descent is relatively high, around 10%. Sarcoidosis can present with bilateral ankle pain and malaise, which increases the posterior probability to around 25%. The patient's shortness of breath and non-productive cough suggest a lung involvement, which is common in Sarcoidosis, increasing the probability further to around 40%. The patient also exhibits symptoms of uveitis (ciliary injection and photophobia), which is a common extrapulmonary manifestation of Sarcoidosis, raising the probability to around 60%. Additionally, the patient is a research assistant at a geology lab, which might expose her to inhaled antigens that can contribute to the development of Sarcoidosis, raising the probability to around 70%. The patient's recent travel history including visits to Nigeria and Arizona could also be contributing factors, as environmental and infectious agents are thought to play a role in the disease. Considering the combination of lung involvement, extrapulmonary manifestations, occupational exposure, and demographic factors, Sarcoidosis is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Sarcoidosis,Y
"A 48-year-old female presents with an enlargement of her anterior neck which made swallowing very difficult for 2 weeks now. She has had constipation for the past 6 weeks and overall fatigue. She also had heavy menstrual bleeding; and often feels extremely cold at home. On the other hand, she has well-controlled asthma and spring allergies. On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. What is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",Reidel thyroiditis,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,N,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,N,Thyroid nodule,N,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,N,Thyroid nodule,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 48-year-old female presenting with an enlargement in the anterior neck, difficulty in swallowing, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and cold intolerance. These symptoms suggest a thyroid-related issue. The thyroid is described as stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged with pain associated with swallowing. The lab studies show a low serum T4 level and an elevated TSH level, indicative of hypothyroidism. However, the hardness of the thyroid and the pain associated with swallowing are suggestive of an inflammatory condition. The low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning points to the thyroid not being functionally active. All these findings are consistent with thyroiditis, and given the firmness and tenderness of the thyroid gland, it is likely to be de Quervain's thyroiditis (subacute thyroiditis), which is characterized by a painful and tender thyroid often following a viral infection, and can cause transient hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism.",Answer: de Quervain's thyroiditis,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for a patient with an enlarged thyroid includes Graves' disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer, and subacute thyroiditis. Considering her symptoms of difficulty in swallowing due to an enlargement in the anterior neck, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and feeling extremely cold, it suggests hypothyroidism. The lab results showing a low serum T4 level and elevated TSH level also support the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Graves' disease usually presents with hyperthyroidism, so it's less likely. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can present with a firm thyroid, but it's usually not painful. Thyroid nodules might cause enlargement but usually don't cause hypothyroidism. Thyroid cancer might present with a hard thyroid gland but doesn't usually present with hypothyroidism and is usually painless. Subacute thyroiditis can present with a painful thyroid but usually has a phase of hyperthyroidism.

This patient�s thyroid is not only enlarged but also stony hard, tender and asymmetrical with pain during swallowing, which are characteristic of Riedel's thyroiditis. This is a rare form of chronic thyroiditis characterized by the replacement of thyroid tissue with dense fibrosis that invades adjacent structures. Additionally, the low radioactive iodine uptake seen in radionuclide thyroid scanning is also consistent with Riedel's thyroiditis, as the fibrotic thyroid gland is not capable of taking up iodine efficiently.",Answer: Riedel's thyroiditis,Y,"Rationale: This 48-year-old female is presenting with an enlargement of her anterior neck, difficulty swallowing, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and cold intolerance. Her laboratory studies show a low serum T4 level and elevated TSH level, which are indicative of hypothyroidism. The stony-hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland along with pain associated with swallowing, and the finding of low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning is characteristic of thyroiditis, and in this clinical setting, it is suggestive of de Quervain's thyroiditis (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis). De Quervain's thyroiditis is an inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland which is often preceded by a viral infection and presents with a painful, tender thyroid gland.",Answer: De Quervain's thyroiditis,N,"Rationale: This 48-year-old female patient is presenting with an enlargement of her anterior neck, difficulty swallowing, constipation, fatigue, heavy menstrual bleeding, and cold intolerance. The lab results show a decreased serum T4 level and an elevated TSH level. The patient's presentation with cold intolerance, constipation, fatigue, and heavy menstrual bleeding, along with the lab findings, are indicative of hypothyroidism. However, the stony-hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland coupled with pain associated with swallowing and low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning is suggestive of thyroiditis, likely subacute thyroiditis, or De Quervain's thyroiditis. In De Quervain's thyroiditis, there is often pain in the anterior neck and thyroid tenderness. The thyroid gland may also be asymmetrically enlarged. The initial phase of De Quervain's thyroiditis can cause the release of thyroid hormones resulting in transient hyperthyroidism which is followed by hypothyroidism which this patient is likely in due to her symptoms and lab values. The low radioactive iodine uptake is consistent with the destruction of thyroid follicles in De Quervain's thyroiditis.",Answer: De Quervain's thyroiditis,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of the patient having thyroiditis is 10%. Considering her symptoms of neck enlargement and difficulty swallowing, the posterior probability increases to 25%. With the addition of constipation, fatigue, and increased menstrual bleeding which are symptoms of hypothyroidism, the probability increases to 50%. The thyroid examination revealing a stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid is consistent with thyroiditis and this finding increases the probability further to 70%. The laboratory studies showing a low serum T4 level and elevated TSH are indicative of hypothyroidism, which is a feature of thyroiditis, raising the probability to 85%. The radionuclide thyroid scanning indicating low radioactive iodine uptake is consistent with thyroiditis, and this increases the probability further to over 90%. Given the combination of clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is thyroiditis, specifically De Quervain's thyroiditis which presents with a painful and tender thyroid.",Answer: De Quervain's thyroiditis,N
"A 5-year-old male is brought to the pediatrician with complaints of a painful mouth/gums, and vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa for the past 4 days. The patient has not been able to eat or drink due to the pain and has been irritable. The patient also reports muscle aches. His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1, HR 110, BP 90/62, RR 18, SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for vesicular lesions noted on the tongue, gingiva, and lips, with some vesicles having ruptured and ulcerated, as well as palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy. What is the most likely causative organism in this patient's presentation?",HSV 1,Herpes simplex virus,Y,Herpes simplex virus (HSV),Y,Herpes simplex virus,Y,Herpes Simplex Virus,Y,Herpes simplex virus,Y,,"Rationale: The 5-year-old patient is presenting with painful vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, which have been present for the past 4 days. He also has difficulty eating or drinking due to pain, and is irritable. Additionally, the patient has muscle aches and palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy. The vesicular lesions in the mouth along with the symptoms of pain, irritability, and lymphadenopathy are characteristic of a viral infection called herpangina, which primarily affects children. The most common causative organism of herpangina is the Coxsackie virus, which is a member of the Enterovirus genus. The presence of vesicular lesions that have ulcerated in the oral cavity, along with lymphadenopathy, and the age group of the patient make Coxsackie virus the most likely cause.",Answer: Coxsackie virus,N,"Rationale: The 5-year-old patient is presenting with painful vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, which have been present for the past 4 days.

These symptoms are characteristic of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, which is an oral infection primarily caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), particularly type 1. HSV is known to cause painful vesicular lesions in the oral cavity, and in primary infection, systemic symptoms such as fever and muscle aches can be prominent. The lymphadenopathy in the cervical and submandibular region is due to the body's immune response trying to fight the infection. Children are often affected when they are first exposed to the virus.",Answer: Herpes simplex virus,Y,"Rationale: This 5-year-old male presents with a painful mouth, vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, muscle aches, fever, and palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy. These symptoms are indicative of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, which is typically caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1. Herpetic gingivostomatitis is characterized by the sudden onset of mouth and gum pain, vesicles or blisters in the oral cavity (which may rupture and ulcerate), lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms such as fever and muscle aches. This condition is most commonly seen in children and is associated with the first exposure to the herpes simplex virus.",Answer: Herpes simplex virus,Y,"Rationale: The initial prior probability of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) being the cause of the oral lesions in a child might be around 20%, given the prevalence of this virus and the fact that the symptoms described could match a variety of viral infections. However, when considering more specific symptoms, the probability begins to shift. The presence of vesicular lesions in the mouth, which is a characteristic sign of a primary HSV infection, could increase the posterior probability to 40%. The inability to eat or drink due to pain further aligns with severe HSV infection, pushing the probability up to 60%. Adding the symptom of muscle aches and fever, which is a common systemic manifestation in HSV infection, could increase the probability to 80%. Finally, the presence of cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy, which indicates a local immune response usually seen in viral infections such as HSV, pushes the probability to a final 90%. This child's presentation is very likely due to an infection with HSV.",Answer: Herpes Simplex Virus,Y
"A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. What is the most common cause of this patient's condition?",Arterial emboli,Deep vein thrombosis,N,Deep vein thrombosis.,N,Deep vein thrombosis,N,Arterial occlusion,Y,Deep vein thrombosis,N,,"Rationale: The patient is presenting with severe pain in the left leg that started suddenly, and physical examination reveals that the leg is pale and cool with a weak popliteal pulse. These symptoms are indicative of acute limb ischemia, a serious condition that occurs when there is a sudden decrease in blood flow to a limb, often due to an embolism or thrombosis. Given the patient's history of hypertension and the presence of an irregular pulse, the most common cause of this condition is likely to be arterial embolism, which is often associated with cardiac conditions like atrial fibrillation, a condition that could give rise to an irregular pulse.",Answer: Arterial embolism,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes: acute arterial occlusion, deep venous thrombosis (DVT), cellulitis, and peripheral neuropathy. The patient's history of sudden severe pain, tingling, and physical examination findings of paleness, coolness, and a weak popliteal pulse on the affected side are more suggestive of acute arterial occlusion, often due to embolism or thrombosis. Among these, embolism is more common, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation, which could be suggested by the irregular pulse. Given the patient's history of hypertension and his irregular pulse, atrial fibrillation and subsequent arterial embolism is the most likely cause.",Answer: Arterial embolism.,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with severe pain, paleness, and coolness of the left leg, as well as a weaker popliteal pulse on the left side. These signs point to acute limb ischemia, which is an emergency and needs immediate attention. The irregular pulse suggests a possible cardiac arrhythmia, like atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of embolic events leading to acute limb ischemia. Thus, in the context of this patient's presentation, atrial fibrillation causing embolization is the most likely cause.",Answer: Atrial fibrillation,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of sudden severe leg pain, coolness, paleness, and a weakened popliteal pulse on the affected side suggests acute limb ischemia. The most common cause of acute limb ischemia is embolic occlusion of the arterial supply, often due to a clot that originates in the heart. This is especially likely in this patient, as he has an irregular pulse, suggesting a possible arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of clot formation in the heart.",Answer: Atrial fibrillation,Y,"The prior probability of an Acute Arterial Occlusion is roughly 5%. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset severe pain and paresthesias in the leg increase the probability to 20%. Physical examination showing a pale and cool leg and a decreased popliteal pulse on the left side, compared to the right, increases the probability to 40%. The presence of atrial fibrillation (as suggested by irregular pulse) increases the posterior probability to around 60%. The most common cause of Acute Arterial Occlusion is embolism originating from the heart, usually due to atrial fibrillation, which makes the posterior probability around 75%. This patient likely has Acute Arterial Occlusion due to an embolism originating from the heart.",Answer: Cardiac embolism,Y
A previously healthy 4-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because she has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours. Her parents report that she has not eaten anything during this period and that they were unable to calm her down. She has not had any trauma. She was born at term via vaginal delivery and her delivery was uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe of the left foot. A photograph of the left foot is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hair tourniquet syndrome,Gouty arthritis,N,Cellulitis,N,Gout.,N,Gout,N,Gouty arthritis,N,,"The scenario involves a healthy 4-month-old girl who has been crying for an extended period, hasn't eaten, and has an abnormal toe. Given her age and the prolonged crying, we can deduce she is experiencing pain or discomfort. An examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe on her left foot, which suggests a localized problem. It's common for young children to get hair or thread wrapped tightly around their toes - a condition known as hair tourniquet syndrome - which can cause discomfort, swelling, and skin discoloration.",Answer: Hair tourniquet syndrome.,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this infant includes fracture, infection (cellulitis or osteomyelitis), insect bite, and hair tourniquet syndrome. Given that the infant was healthy before and there's no history of trauma or insect exposure, fracture or insect bite becomes less likely. Although infection is possible, it would usually be associated with fever or other systemic signs, which are not present here. Hair tourniquet syndrome, a condition where a hair or thread becomes tightly wrapped around an extremity causing pain, swelling, and potentially tissue damage, is a possibility here. This condition often affects toes and fingers of infants, and the sudden onset of inconsolable crying without other systemic signs makes this the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Hair tourniquet syndrome.,Y,"In the absence of an image, it's challenging to give a specific diagnosis. However, given the information provided, it seems this 4-month-old girl is experiencing pain and discomfort in her toe. One common cause for such symptoms in infants can be a ""hair tourniquet"" syndrome, also known as toe tourniquet syndrome, where a hair or thread becomes tightly wrapped around a toe, causing pain, swelling, and erythema. This condition often requires careful examination to spot and can be easily missed. In the absence of any trauma or other systemic signs and symptoms, this seems to be the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Hair tourniquet syndrome.,Y,"Rationale: Given that the baby has a swollen toe without history of trauma, it is likely that something is constricting the circulation to the toe. Hair tourniquet syndrome is a potential cause in which a strand of hair can inadvertently get wrapped around a baby's digit (toes or fingers), causing constriction, swelling, and significant pain. This condition is particularly possible in this scenario as the baby's discomfort is non-specific and there are no other symptoms to suggest systemic illness.",Answer: Hair tourniquet syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of hair tourniquet syndrome, a condition where hair or thread becomes tightly wrapped around a digit causing pain, swelling, and discoloration, in a healthy 4-month-old child presenting with a swollen toe and crying might initially be quite low, say around 5%. However, given the specific symptoms of localized swelling and redness in the toe (which might increase the probability to about 20%), and the fact that the child appears otherwise healthy and was not subjected to any recent trauma (which might increase the probability to 40%), this diagnosis becomes more likely. The prolonged crying and refusal to eat, likely due to the pain and discomfort, could increase the posterior probability further to 60%. Without any other likely diagnoses presented in the question, hair tourniquet syndrome is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",Answer: Hair tourniquet syndrome,Y
"A 24-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of agitation, confusion, and lethargy. She has also had progressive recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month. Three days ago, she had a seizure but has not seen a physician. She is oriented only to person. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds. Her laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 7000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 148 mEq/L
Cl- 100 mEq/L
K+ 3.8 mEq/L

Urea nitrogen 18 mg/L
Glucose 90 mg/L
Creatinine 0.8 mg/L
Osmolality 300 mOsmol/kg H2O
Urine osmolality 240 mOsm/kg H2O
What is the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia?""",Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion,SIADH,N,Dehydration,N,Diabetes insipidus,Y,Diabetes insipidus,Y,SIADH,N,,"Rationale: The patient presents with agitation, confusion, lethargy, headaches, visual impairment, and a history of a recent seizure. All of these are symptoms that could be caused by an electrolyte imbalance, such as hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is defined as a serum sodium level greater than 145 mEq/L. This patient's serum sodium level is 148 mEq/L, indicating hypernatremia. Hypernatremia results from an imbalance in the body's water-to-sodium ratio.

This patient also shows an elevated serum osmolality (300 mOsm/kg H2O, normal range is around 275-295 mOsm/kg H2O) and decreased urine osmolality (240 mOsm/kg H2O, normal range is around 500-800 mOsm/kg H2O in a hydrated state). Serum osmolality is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the blood, while urine osmolality measures the concentration of solutes in the urine. An elevated serum osmolality with a decreased urine osmolality suggests that this patient is losing water more than sodium, concentrating the sodium in the blood, while the kidneys are appropriately diluting urine to try and conserve water.

Furthermore, a prolonged capillary refill time could suggest dehydration, as could her symptoms of lethargy and confusion.

In conclusion, this patient's hypernatremia is most likely due to dehydration, specifically water loss that is causing a relative increase in her serum sodium concentration. Her kidneys are attempting to retain as much water as possible, thus producing diluted urine and further concentrating her blood.",Answer: Dehydration,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient's hypernatremia includes: dehydration (both hypovolemic and euvolemic), diabetes insipidus (either central or nephrogenic), excessive salt intake, Cushing's syndrome, or hyperaldosteronism.

Hypernatremia (high serum sodium) is defined as a serum sodium level >145 mEq/L. It occurs due to loss of water in excess of sodium, gain of sodium in excess of water, or rarely, from water loss alone.

This patient's symptoms including agitation, confusion, lethargy, headaches, visual impairment, and seizures suggest a central nervous system issue, which may occur in severe hypernatremia due to brain cell shrinkage. The urine osmolality of 240 mOsm/kg H2O is less than the serum osmolality of 300 mOsm/kg H2O, which implies that the kidneys are not appropriately concentrating the urine in the face of hypernatremia.

The high serum osmolality indicates that this is a case of hypertonic hypernatremia, the most common type, often due to water loss or occasionally sodium gain.

Hypovolemic hypernatremia (from water loss) usually manifests with signs of dehydration such as tachycardia and hypotension, but her vitals do not support this. Also, her capillary refill time is more than 3 seconds, which is not typical in dehydration.

This leaves us with diabetes insipidus (DI) as a likely possibility. DI is a disorder of water balance caused by the inability to concentrate urine, leading to the passage of large volumes of dilute urine. It is divided into central (a deficiency of vasopressin, the antidiuretic hormone) and nephrogenic (kidneys do not respond to vasopressin). Her symptoms of polyuria (assumed from low urine osmolality) and CNS symptoms could be explained by central DI, potentially secondary to a lesion given her neurological symptoms.",Answer: Central Diabetes Insipidus,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with hypernatremia (Na+ 148 mEq/L, normal range: 135-145 mEq/L). The elevated serum osmolality (300 mOsmol/kg H2O, normal range: 275-295 mOsmol/kg H2O) and lower urine osmolality (240 mOsmol/kg H2O) indicate that the body is trying to conserve water, however, it is not sufficiently concentrating the urine. These signs are typical of diabetes insipidus (DI). Symptoms of DI include confusion and agitation due to hypernatremia. Moreover, the recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month suggest an intracranial process, such as a pituitary tumor, which could result in central DI by interfering with the production or release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH).",Answer: Central Diabetes Insipidus,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of agitation, confusion, lethargy, and seizures could be attributed to her hypernatremia (serum Na+ 148 mEq/L, normal range 135-145 mEq/L). Hypernatremia, or an abnormally high concentration of sodium in the blood, often results from insufficient water intake or excessive water loss. This patient's capillary refill time of more than 3 seconds is indicative of dehydration, further suggesting inadequate water intake. The relatively low urine osmolality (240 mOsm/kg H2O) suggests that her kidneys are correctly responding to dehydration by concentrating the urine to conserve water. However, if she's not drinking enough fluids to compensate for the water loss, she could still develop hypernatremia.

Given her neurological symptoms (recurring headaches, visual impairment, seizures, and altered mental status), it's also plausible that there is a defect in her thirst mechanism or access to water, as could occur with hypothalamic disease or physical or mental disability preventing her from drinking. However, more clinical information would be required to confirm this.

In conclusion, this patient's hypernatremia is most likely due to inadequate water intake, whether due to impaired thirst, lack of access to water, or both.",Answer: Inadequate water intake,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of diabetes insipidus (DI) is 1%. Diabetes insipidus is a condition characterized by frequent and heavy urination, extreme thirst, and the presence of high levels of sodium in the blood. In this case, the patient's blood tests show a high level of sodium (Na+ 148 mEq/L), which is indicative of hypernatremia, a condition often associated with diabetes insipidus. This finding increases the posterior probability of diabetes insipidus to 20%.

Secondly, the patient's urine osmolality is low (240 mOsm/kg H2O), while serum osmolality is high (300 mOsm/kg H2O). This indicates that the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine, further supporting the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and increasing the probability to 40%.

In addition, the patient presents with symptoms such as agitation, confusion, and lethargy, which can be associated with hypernatremia, increasing the probability of diabetes insipidus to 60%.

Lastly, the patient has had progressive recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month. These are potential symptoms of a pituitary tumor, which could cause central diabetes insipidus by interfering with the storage and release of vasopressin. This increases the probability of diabetes insipidus to 80%.

Therefore, given the clinical findings and laboratory results, the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia is diabetes insipidus.",Answer: Diabetes insipidus.,Y
"An 81-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son to be evaluated for memory issues. The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Vascular dementia,Vascular dementia,Y,Vascular dementia,Y,Vascular dementia,Y,Stroke,N,Vascular dementia,Y,,"Rationale: This patient presents with a progressive decline in memory and cognition over several years, which has recently worsened. The presentation suggests a disorder of cognitive function, the main consideration being a form of dementia. Given the chronicity of his symptoms and the recent acute worsening, two main diagnoses come to mind: Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.

However, the patient's history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents, including a hemorrhage and an infarction, as well as the hemiparesis noted on his examination, suggest that his cognitive issues are most likely related to vascular incidents. His transient vision loss could also be attributed to a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is consistent with a vascular etiology. This points to a diagnosis of vascular dementia, a form of dementia caused by damage to the brain from impaired blood supply, which can occur as a result of strokes or TIAs. Vascular dementia is characterized by stepwise decline in cognitive function, which is in line with the history provided.",Answer: Vascular dementia,Y,"Rationale:
The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Lewy body dementia, and a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Considering the patient's history of progressive memory issues and recent acute worsening, the long-term history of vascular disease with previous stroke, and the transient visual loss in the right eye, vascular dementia becomes a likely candidate. However, the episode of sudden, transient visual loss could also suggest a TIA. Yet, the progressive cognitive impairment over several years is not typical for TIAs, which are usually associated with transient neurological symptoms that resolve completely. The patient's reduced muscle strength, tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side as well as the hemiparetic gait point towards a long-standing neurological condition rather than a recent one. Given that this is a chronic condition with recent acute exacerbation and the patient's significant history of vascular disease, the most likely diagnosis is vascular dementia.",Answer: Vascular dementia.,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with a gradual worsening of memory loss over the years, recently becoming acutely worse. This memory impairment, particularly involving recent events and names, suggests a cognitive disorder. Given the progressive nature of the symptoms, this could indicate a type of dementia. The lack of insight into the problem is also common in dementia. Moreover, this patient's history of a left basal ganglia hemorrhage and a right middle cerebral artery infarction points towards vascular contributions to the cognitive decline. Importantly, the fluctuating course of cognitive symptoms, exemplified by the sudden but reversible visual loss, is a distinguishing feature of Vascular Dementia. The physical findings of muscle strength of 4/5 on the right side, slightly reduced tone on the right side, exaggerated reflexes, and hemiparetic gait, further confirm a history of cerebrovascular disease.",Answer: Vascular Dementia,Y,"Rationale: The patient's history and presentation provide various clues that suggest vascular dementia. Key features of vascular dementia include cognitive impairment, presence of cerebrovascular disease, and a relationship between the two. In this case, the patient's progressively worsening memory issues over several years align with the gradual cognitive decline typical of vascular dementia. Furthermore, the patient's history of cerebrovascular disease (basal ganglia hemorrhage and middle cerebral artery infarction) and risk factors for vascular disease (hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2) support this diagnosis. The presence of hemiparesis and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, which may be a consequence of his previous strokes, further strengthen the suspicion of vascular dementia. Acute worsening of symptoms may indicate a recent cerebrovascular event, with transient vision loss suggesting a transient ischemic attack. Although Alzheimer's disease is a common cause of dementia in the elderly, this patient's neurological signs and risk factors strongly suggest a vascular etiology.",Answer: Vascular dementia,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of vascular dementia is 15% in an elderly patient with memory issues, as it is a common cause of dementia in this population. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension, both risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, increase the probability of vascular dementia to 25%. The patient's previous strokes also increase the posterior probability to 40%. His recent sudden visual loss might suggest a transient ischemic attack, a common finding in patients with vascular disease, which raises the probability to 55%. The patient's inability to perform simple arithmetic calculations and hemiparetic gait, which are consistent with multiple cerebral insults, increases the likelihood of vascular dementia to 70%. Lastly, the patient's lack of insight into his problems is often seen in vascular dementia, increasing the probability to 80%. Therefore, this patient most likely has vascular dementia.",Answer: Vascular dementia,Y

Abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""",History of abdominal surgery,Small bowel obstruction,Y,Small bowel obstruction,Y,Small bowel obstruction,Y,Small bowel obstruction,Y,Small bowel obstruction,Y,,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with severe abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, and absence of passing flatus or stool which indicate an intestinal obstruction. His abdominal examination is consistent with obstruction as it reveals distension and high-pitched bowel sounds. The absence of flatus and stool passage implies that the obstruction is likely complete. The fact that he underwent an appendectomy in the past makes him susceptible to the formation of adhesions or scar tissue inside the abdomen, which can lead to mechanical bowel obstruction by binding the intestines. His history of psoriasis and use of ibuprofen are not likely contributors to this presentation. The abdominal ultrasound showing nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel also supports the diagnosis of a mechanical bowel obstruction.",Answer: Adhesions causing bowel obstruction,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient with abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, distention, and high-pitched bowel sounds includes small bowel obstruction, gastroenteritis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and mesenteric ischemia. Given the history of appendectomy, the presence of distention, high-pitched bowel sounds, and absence of flatus, a small bowel obstruction is likely. Gastroenteritis would typically present with diarrhea, which is absent in this case. Pancreatitis would generally present with more severe pain and elevated amylase and lipase, which are not mentioned. Cholecystitis would present with right upper quadrant pain and possibly elevated liver enzymes. Mesenteric ischemia is less likely in the absence of severe pain out of proportion to examination findings. The abdominal ultrasound showing nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel supports the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. The history of previous surgery (appendectomy) is an important clue because adhesions are a common cause of small bowel obstructions.",Answer: Small bowel obstruction,Y,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, distention, and has not passed flatus, suggesting an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract. The history of prior abdominal surgery is crucial as it points towards the likelihood of adhesion formation, which is a common cause of small bowel obstruction. The patient�s history of psoriasis and use of NSAIDs (ibuprofen) could be pertinent; however, the findings on the physical examination (distended abdomen and high-pitched bowel sounds) and abdominal ultrasound showing nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel, are more consistent with mechanical obstruction due to adhesions rather than inflammatory or pharmacologic causes. Adhesions cause the bowel loops to stick together, and this can lead to a blockage in the small intestine, causing the symptoms seen in this patient.",Answer: Adhesions,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with severe abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and high-pitched bowel sounds which are suggestive of a bowel obstruction. He has not passed flatus and his last bowel movement was the day before. Given his history of appendectomy, adhesions from the previous surgery are a common cause of small bowel obstruction. The patient's abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel, which is consistent with mechanical obstruction of the bowel, most likely due to adhesions. Adhesions cause the bowel to kink and obstruct, leading to accumulation of bowel contents proximal to the site of obstruction, resulting in distension and the associated symptoms.",Answer: Adhesions,Y,"Rationale: This patient has been experiencing severe abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, distension, and has not passed flatus recently, which are symptoms that can be indicative of a bowel obstruction. Given that the patient has not had a bowel movement and has high-pitched bowel sounds on auscultation, these findings are consistent with a mechanical obstruction. His history of appendectomy at the age of 39 is significant as this indicates that he had a surgery in the past, which makes him susceptible to adhesions. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can form after abdominal surgery and can sometimes cause the intestines to stick together. This can lead to a kinking or twisting of the intestines, resulting in mechanical obstruction. The patient's distended abdomen and nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel on abdominal ultrasound further support the diagnosis of a mechanical bowel obstruction most likely due to adhesions from the past surgery.",Answer: Adhesions,Y
"A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was “pretty cold” in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32°C (89.6°F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. What drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",Fluphenazine,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,N,Anticholinergic drug,N,Drug-induced hypothermia,N,Drug toxicity,N,Tricyclic antidepressant,N,,"Rationale: The patient presents with altered mental status, lethargy, hypothermia (32�C or 89.6�F), bradycardia (pulse 54/min), respiratory depression (respirations 8/min), weakness in lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes, and mydriasis (dilated pupils poorly reactive to light). The clinical picture is indicative of a central nervous system depression. Since the patient has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and has been started on a new drug 10 days ago, it is imperative to consider the role of the medication in the development of these symptoms. Among medications used for schizoaffective disorder, antipsychotics are known to have a potential side effect of neuroleptic malignant syndrome which can cause altered mental status and lead to dysregulation of temperature, but that usually presents with hyperthermia and not hypothermia. However, medications such as sedative-hypnotics, including benzodiazepines and barbiturates, could be responsible for CNS depression. The patient's attempt to remove his clothing despite being hypothermic (paradoxical undressing) is a classic symptom of severe hypothermia which can be aggravated by sedatives. It is likely that the new medication is a sedative or hypnotic, causing CNS and respiratory depression leading to the clinical presentation.",Answer: Sedative or Hypnotic Medication,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes hypothermia, hypothyroidism, side effects of medication, hypoglycemia, and psychiatric decompensation. The fact that the patient was found in a cold environment with low body temperature indicates that hypothermia might be involved. However, his recent initiation on a new drug, along with the history of hypothyroidism and schizoaffective disorder, should also be considered. The symptoms of hypothermia include lethargy, bradycardia, and hyporeflexia which are present in this patient. The patient's attempt to remove his clothing could be a sign of paradoxical undressing seen in severe hypothermia.

Hypothyroidism could also cause lethargy and hyporeflexia, but would not explain the hypothermia.

As for medications, antipsychotics used for schizoaffective disorder can have a side effect called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) which presents with altered mental status, but it usually causes hyperthermia and not hypothermia. However, some antipsychotic medications can also impair thermoregulation.

Considering the clinical picture, the recent initiation of a new medication, and the symptoms presented, the drug most likely causing these findings might be an antipsychotic medication that impairs the patient�s ability to regulate body temperature.",Answer: Antipsychotic medication,Y,"Rationale: The patient in this scenario has several key findings such as altered mental status, hypothermia (32�C or 89.6�F), bradycardia (pulse 54/min), bradypnea (respirations 8/min), weakness in lower extremities, absent deep tendon reflexes, and dilated pupils poorly reactive to light. One of the critical elements in the history is that the patient has hypothyroidism and was started on a new drug ten days ago.

The combination of hypothermia, bradycardia, altered mental status, and decreased deep tendon reflexes is indicative of severe hypothyroidism, termed myxedema coma. It is crucial to consider that certain drugs can precipitate myxedema coma in patients with hypothyroidism. Of the medications that this patient might be taking for his other conditions (schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension), the most likely culprit is a medication that affects mental status and could exacerbate hypothyroidism, such as lithium. Lithium is used to treat mood disorders and can inhibit thyroid hormone release, potentially leading to or exacerbating hypothyroidism and causing myxedema coma, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.",Answer: Lithium,N,"Rationale: The patient in this case is presenting with hypothermia, bradycardia (slow heart rate), respiratory depression, weakness in the lower extremities, and altered mental status. The fact that his apartment was cold is a clue, but his symptoms are too severe to be explained solely by the environmental temperature. His presentation is indicative of severe hypothyroidism, which could be secondary to the use of a medication that affects his thyroid function. Of the conditions he has, it is pertinent to focus on hypothyroidism as a condition that can be affected significantly by medications. A drug that can cause hypothyroidism and can explain this patient's presentation is lithium. Lithium is often used to treat schizoaffective disorder, and can cause hypothyroidism by inhibiting thyroid hormone release. Hypothyroidism can cause decreased metabolic activity, leading to hypothermia, bradycardia, respiratory depression, muscle weakness, and altered mental status, all of which are present in this patient. The addition of a new drug 10 days ago and the presentation of these symptoms highly suggest the involvement of the new drug in causing severe hypothyroidism.",Answer: Lithium,N,"Rationale: Step 1: The prior probability of a medication causing the altered mental status and hypothermia is high in this patient given his history of multiple medical conditions requiring medications.

Step 2: Among his medications, thyroid drugs, antipsychotics, and antihypertensives are common culprits of altered mental status. The fact that the patient was started on a new medication 10 days ago increases the posterior probability of that medication being the cause.

Step 3: The patient has hypothyroidism, and medications used for its management usually do not cause hypothermia or altered mental status, so the likelihood of thyroid medication being the cause decreases.

Step 4: His presentation with hypothermia, bradycardia, lethargy, and altered mental status is classic for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which can be caused by antipsychotic medications. Since the patient has schizoaffective disorder and was started on a new medication recently, the probability of an antipsychotic medication causing these symptoms increases.

Step 5: Given the constellation of symptoms and the likelihood of a new medication being started, the probability of an antipsychotic medication causing NMS, leading to this presentation, becomes very high.",Answer: Antipsychotic medication,Y
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient’s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. What medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",Clomipramine,Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,Antidepressant/antipsychotic,N,,"Rationale: This 21-year-old man has a history of major depressive disorder and was found unconscious next to a bottle of pills, suggesting a possible overdose. Patients with depression are often prescribed antidepressants. Among the various classes of antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are notorious for being lethal in overdose. The presentation of the patient with altered mental status, i.e., moving into a coma, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing a prolonged QT interval, are both consistent with TCA toxicity. TCA overdose can cause a variety of symptoms including anticholinergic effects, sedation, seizures, respiratory depression, and cardiovascular toxicity, which can be life-threatening. The ECG changes including QT prolongation are characteristic findings in TCA overdose.",Answer: Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,"Rationale: In this scenario, a 21-year-old male is found unconscious next to a bottle of pills and has a history of major depressive disorder. The differential for medication overdose in this context could include antidepressants (such as SSRIs, TCAs, or MAOIs), benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or other medications used for mood disorders. As he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, it is highly likely he was prescribed an antidepressant. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Prolongation of the QT interval is a common consequence of overdose with certain antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). TCAs can cause cardiac toxicity, and in overdose, they can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, seizures, and coma. The presence of a prolonged QT interval, combined with the history of depression and the fact that he was found unconscious next to a bottle of pills, points to an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants.",Answer: Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a 21-year-old man with a known history of major depressive disorder. He is found unconscious next to a bottle of pills, suggesting a probable overdose. His mother mentions that he was taking medication for his depression which did not considerably improve his symptoms. This indicates that the medication he was taking was likely an antidepressant. The ECG showing a prolonged QT interval is an important clue. Some antidepressants, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), are known to cause QT prolongation at therapeutic doses, and this effect is even more pronounced in cases of overdose. The combination of a patient with depression, found unconscious next to medication, and exhibiting a prolonged QT interval on ECG is suggestive of an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants.",Answer: Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,"Rationale: The patient in question is a 21-year-old man with a history of major depressive disorder. He is found unconscious next to a bottle of pills, which suggests an intentional overdose. His ECG reveals a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Prolongation of the QT interval is a key indicator of an overdose of certain medications, particularly tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). TCAs are known to block cardiac potassium channels, which can lead to the prolongation of the QT interval, and in severe cases, can lead to fatal arrhythmias. TCAs are sometimes used for the treatment of depression, especially in cases that do not respond well to first-line medications. It is therefore reasonable to deduce that the patient most likely overdosed on TCAs.",Answer: Tricyclic antidepressants,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability that the patient overdosed on antidepressants is high considering his history of major depressive disorder. Among the various types of antidepressants, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are notorious for causing significant toxicity in overdose.

Step 1: Given that the patient has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, the prior probability that he overdosed on antidepressants is significant. Let�s say 70%.

Step 2: The history of a prior diagnosis of major depressive disorder, with minimal improvement despite medication, increases the likelihood that the patient might be on TCAs as they are effective but often reserved for refractory cases due to their side effect profile. This increases the posterior probability of TCA overdose to 80%.

Step 3: The patient�s mother mentions that he has been socially isolated and has threatened to take his life, which increases the likelihood of a suicide attempt through medication overdose. This information raises the posterior probability of TCA overdose to 85%.

Step 4: The ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Prolongation of the QT interval is a characteristic finding in TCA overdose. This further raises the posterior probability of TCA overdose to 95%.

Considering this information and the Bayesian inference, the patient most likely overdosed on tricyclic antidepressants.",Answer: Tricyclic antidepressants,Y
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. She states it is 10/10 in intensity and states that it is associated with chewing. She describes it as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The patient is otherwise healthy and is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 111/74 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Temporomandibular joint dysfunction,TMJ disorder,Y,TMJ dysfunction,Y,TMJ Syndrome,Y,Temporomandibular joint disorder,Y,TMJ dysfunction,Y,,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with a severe headache that is associated with chewing and is localized to the sides of her head, particularly over the mandibular and temporal region. The pain is described as dull and worsens when she opens and closes her mouth. Considering the patient's age, and the specific presentation of the symptoms - pain associated with chewing and tenderness over the temporal region, it is most likely that she has Temporal Arteritis (also known as Giant Cell Arteritis). Temporal arteritis involves inflammation of the arteries, especially those near the temples. While the exact cause is not known, it is believed to be an autoimmune condition.

However, another condition that must be considered in this case is Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Syndrome which involves pain and compromised movement of the jaw joint and the surrounding muscles. But since there is also tenderness over the temporal region, Temporal Arteritis is more likely.",Answer: Temporal Arteritis,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes temporal arteritis, trigeminal neuralgia, tension headache, migraine, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD), and sinusitis. Temporal arteritis typically occurs in older patients and is associated with visual symptoms and jaw claudication, which does not match the patient�s presentation. Trigeminal neuralgia usually presents as a sharp, shooting pain, which doesn't correlate with the patient�s description of a dull pain. Tension headache is usually bilateral and pressing but is not specifically worsened by chewing. Migraines typically present with throbbing pain and are associated with nausea, vomiting, and light sensitivity, which this patient does not report. Sinusitis usually presents with facial pain and nasal discharge, which is not mentioned here. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) presents as pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region, especially when opening and closing the mouth, which matches the patient�s symptoms. This patient most likely has temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD).",Answer: Temporomandibular joint disorder,Y,"Rationale: The patient is experiencing a severe headache that is 10/10 in intensity, associated with chewing, and is localized as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that worsens when she opens and closes her mouth. The described symptoms are characteristic of Temporomandibular Joint Disorder (TMD). TMD is characterized by pain and tenderness in the jaw, particularly in the muscles that control jaw movement and the temporomandibular joint. The pain typically gets worse with jaw movement such as chewing.",Answer: Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,Y,"Rationale: This 24-year-old woman is experiencing a severe headache that is associated with chewing, and the pain is localized over the sides of her head, particularly the temporal and mandibular regions. Considering her age, symptoms, and the absence of other notable findings or history, this points towards a disorder involving the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The temporomandibular joint is the hinge joint that connects the jaw to the temporal bones of the skull, and inflammation or dysfunction of this joint can cause pain in the jaw and in the muscles that control jaw movement. The pain and tenderness worsened by opening and closing the mouth, as well as pain over the temporal region, are classic signs of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD).",Answer: Temporomandibular joint disorder,Y,"Rationale:
Step 1: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders would have a prior probability of around 5% in a general population. However, considering the patient�s age, the prior probability increases slightly to 10%.
Step 2: The patient describes a severe headache, 10/10 in intensity, which can be consistent with many conditions. Since this symptom is non-specific, it does not significantly alter the probability.
Step 3: The association of the headache with chewing is a significant clue. This symptom is highly suggestive of a TMJ disorder, raising the probability to around 50%.
Step 4: The patient describes the pain as being located over the sides of her head which again is consistent with TMJ disorder, raising the probability to around 70%.
Step 5: The physical exam shows pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region, especially when the patient opens and closes their mouth. This is highly suggestive of TMJ disorder and raises the probability to approximately 90%.

Based on the Bayesian inference, the likelihood of this patient having a Temporomandibular joint disorder is very high.",Answer: Temporomandibular joint disorder,Y
"Twelve hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, a 36-year-old man has shortness of breath. He has asthma well controlled with an albuterol inhaler. His father died of lung cancer at 62 years of age. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years. He does not drink alcohol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. Examination shows reduced breath sounds over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There is a clean, dry surgical incision over the midline of the abdomen. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The calves are soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 12.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 10,600/mm3, and platelet count is 230,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest in supine position is shown. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Atelectasis,Pulmonary embolism,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,Pneumothorax,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,,"Rationale: The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer and 12 hours post-surgery is experiencing shortness of breath. This suggests there might be a complication related to the surgery or an underlying condition. He is a smoker which puts him at risk for respiratory issues, but given the acute onset following surgery, this might be less likely the primary cause. On examination, there are reduced breath sounds over the left lung base, and he is afebrile. These clinical findings are suggestive of atelectasis which is a common postoperative complication, especially after abdominal surgery. Atelectasis is a condition where the alveoli within the lung collapse, leading to reduced gas exchange and shortness of breath. It is particularly common in the early postoperative period, especially in patients with a history of smoking.",Answer: Atelectasis,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion. The shortness of breath and reduced breath sounds over the left lung base in the post-operative period are key to narrowing the differential diagnosis. In a patient who has recently undergone abdominal surgery, atelectasis and pleural effusion are common post-operative complications. Pneumonia and pulmonary embolism would likely present with additional symptoms such as fever or calf pain and swelling, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Hemothorax and pneumothorax would cause severe respiratory distress and are less likely. The smoking history and recent surgery contribute to the likelihood of atelectasis, which is a common post-operative complication. Atelectasis is a collapse of the alveoli in the lungs and it can lead to reduced breath sounds. Furthermore, the patient's history of asthma and cigarette smoking increase the risk for atelectasis. Based on the clinical presentation and risk factors, atelectasis is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Answer: Atelectasis,Y,"Rationale: In the case of this 36-year-old man who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, and now has shortness of breath with reduced breath sounds over the left lung base, the most likely cause of his symptoms is atelectasis. Atelectasis is the collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange. It is a common postoperative complication, particularly following abdominal surgery. This is because pain from the surgical incision may cause the patient to take shallow breaths, leading to inadequate lung expansion. Other risk factors for atelectasis include a history of smoking, as in this patient, and underlying lung disease such as asthma. The decreased breath sounds on examination and the shortness of breath which started after the surgery strongly suggest atelectasis as the cause of this patient's symptoms.",Answer: Atelectasis,Y,"Rationale: This 36-year-old man has developed shortness of breath twelve hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy. He appears uncomfortable, and there are reduced breath sounds over the left lung base. It's important to consider postoperative complications in a patient who has recently undergone abdominal surgery. The reduced breath sounds on the left side along with the shortness of breath and the fact that the patient is not showing signs of a systemic infection (his temperature is near normal) suggest the likelihood of atelectasis or a pleural effusion, both common postoperative complications. The atelectasis is more common in smokers and can occur due to reduced respiratory effort postoperatively (especially after abdominal surgery, where deep breathing is painful), leading to alveolar collapse. It may also be attributed to shallow breathing secondary to pain. In atelectasis, there is a decrease in or absence of air in the alveoli, resulting in reduced oxygen exchange and hypoxemia, which would cause the patient to be short of breath. The absence of signs suggesting a cardiac cause and his history of smoking also make atelectasis more likely compared to other causes.",Answer: Atelectasis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of a postoperative complication such as atelectasis or pleural effusion is quite high given his recent surgery. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and reduced breath sounds over the left lung base increase the probability to 60%. Given that cardiac examination shows no abnormalities, the likelihood of a heart condition causing these symptoms reduces, further increasing the likelihood of a pulmonary postoperative complication to 80%. Considering all these factors, it is likely that this patient's symptoms are due to a postoperative complication, such as atelectasis or pleural effusion.",Answer: Postoperative Atelectasis or Pleural Effusion,Y
A 65-year-old previously healthy man presents to the primary care physician with the chief complaint of red colored urine over the past month. He states that he does not experience dysuria. On physical exam there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. With this presentation which is the most likely cause of this patient's hematuria?,Bladder tumor,Glomerulonephritis,N,Glomerulonephritis,N,Glomerulonephritis,N,Glomerulonephritis,N,Glomerulonephritis,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 65-year-old male who presents with painless red-colored urine (hematuria) over the past month. Hematuria in males, particularly of this age group, is most often associated with problems in the urinary tract, such as infections, stones, or malignancies. The absence of dysuria makes infection less likely, and lack of costovertebral angle tenderness makes renal stones less likely. Given his age and the chronicity and painless nature of his hematuria, this man's symptoms are most consistent with a urinary tract malignancy, which includes malignancies of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. The most common among these in older males is bladder cancer.",Answer: Bladder Cancer,Y,"The differential for this patient includes urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, bladder or kidney infection, renal trauma, glomerulonephritis, renal or bladder tumors, anticoagulant usage, and a hereditary disorder like Alport syndrome or sickle cell disease. However, the patient does not experience dysuria, which makes a UTI or bladder infection unlikely. The lack of costovertebral angle tenderness suggests the absence of kidney infection or renal trauma. Kidney stones usually cause pain and the patient is otherwise healthy with no mention of anticoagulant usage or a hereditary disorder. Considering the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms, a renal or bladder tumor could be the most likely cause of painless hematuria.",Answer: Renal or bladder tumor.,Y,"Rationale: A 65-year-old previously healthy man presenting with painless red colored urine, or hematuria, without any signs of urinary tract infection or renal calculi (indicated by absence of dysuria and costovertebral angle tenderness), could have a number of underlying causes. Some of the common causes include kidney stones, urinary tract infections, or kidney diseases. However, in older males, a significant concern with painless hematuria is bladder cancer, especially in the absence of other indicative symptoms for other conditions. Therefore, this patient's most likely cause of hematuria is bladder cancer.",Answer: Bladder cancer,Y,"Rationale: This patient's hematuria (red colored urine), particularly given his age and the absence of symptoms such as pain, suggests a more sinister underlying cause such as a genitourinary malignancy. Among these, bladder cancer is the most common cause of painless hematuria in adults, especially in older patients. Kidney stones or urinary tract infections could also cause hematuria, but these conditions are usually associated with other symptoms such as pain (renal colic, dysuria) or costovertebral angle tenderness, which are not present in this patient.",Answer: Bladder cancer,Y,"Rationale: Starting with a broad perspective, in a 65-year-old man presenting with painless hematuria (red colored urine), the most concerning causes include urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, and malignancies such as bladder cancer or kidney cancer.

The prior probability of each condition in a healthy, asymptomatic man in his mid-60s might look something like this: UTI 10%, kidney stones 20%, bladder cancer 30%, kidney cancer 40%. These probabilities are rough estimates and can vary based on individual patient factors and population statistics.

This patient does not experience dysuria (pain or burning during urination), which is commonly seen in UTI, so we can adjust the posterior probabilities: UTI down to 5%, kidney stones remain at 20%, bladder cancer up to 35%, kidney cancer up to 40%.

There is also no costovertebral angle tenderness on physical exam, which is often present with kidney stones or kidney infections, further adjusting our probabilities: UTI down to 2%, kidney stones down to 10%, bladder cancer up to 43%, kidney cancer up to 45%.

Considering the patient's age and the nature of his symptom (painless hematuria), the likelihood of a malignant cause like bladder or kidney cancer increases. And among those, bladder cancer is more common than kidney cancer in the general population. This boosts the posterior probability of bladder cancer further.",Answer: Bladder Cancer,Y
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe dyspnea and a productive cough containing streaks of blood since the day before. He had a sudden pruritic papular rash on his right thigh when he was in the southwestern USA hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico. The next day he developed severely painful inguinal swelling on the same side; however, he did not see a physician and controlled the pain with painkillers. There is no other history of serious illness. He does not take any other medications. He appears confused. The temperature is 39.5℃ (103.1℉), the pulse is 105/min, the respiration rate is 32/min, and the blood pressure is 95/45 mm Hg. Rales are heard in the lower lobe of the left lung on auscultation. The right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core. The surrounding area is edematous without overlying erythema or cellulitis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is shown in the picture. What best explains these findings?",Plague,Tularemia,Y,Lyme disease,N,Tularemia,Y,Lymphadenitis,N,Tularemia,Y,,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of a pruritic papular rash, severely painful inguinal swelling, confusion, fever, and signs of systemic illness after hiking in the southwestern USA are suggestive of a disease transmitted by the bite of an infected flea. The enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core suggest the formation of a bubo, which is a swollen and painful lymph node, which is indicative of Yersinia pestis infection or bubonic plague. The presence of severe dyspnea, a productive cough containing streaks of blood, and the auscultation findings point towards a possible progression of the disease to pneumonic plague. The history of hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico further strengthens the likelihood of this diagnosis, as these areas are known for their rodent populations that can harbor fleas infected with Yersinia pestis.",Answer: Bubonic plague.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes pneumonia (bacterial or viral), pulmonary embolism, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and a systemic infection. The patient has a history of a pruritic rash followed by painful inguinal swelling while hiking in the southwestern USA, suggesting a potential vector-borne disease. The symptoms of severe dyspnea, productive cough with hemoptysis, fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea, along with confusion and hypotension, suggest a systemic infection. The localized finding of enlarged inguinal lymph nodes with a hard core and the history of exposure in an endemic area suggest bubonic plague caused by Yersinia pestis. This diagnosis would be confirmed with isolation of Y. pestis from a blood culture or aspirate of an affected lymph node.",Answer: Bubonic Plague,Y,"Rationale: The patient presented with a pruritic papular rash following a hiking trip in the southwestern USA, and soon thereafter developed painful inguinal swelling. This, along with his severe dyspnea, a productive cough with streaks of blood, confusion, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension, suggests a systemic infection. The mentioned region (northern Arizona and New Mexico) is known for endemic Coccidioides immitis, a fungal pathogen that causes coccidioidomycosis (also known as Valley Fever). Initial infection typically occurs through inhalation of the fungal spores and can present as pneumonia, which aligns with his pulmonary symptoms. Disseminated disease can occur, especially in immunocompromised individuals, leading to extrapulmonary manifestations like skin lesions and lymphadenopathy. While a CT scan isn't actually shown here, the mention of a scan combined with the given symptoms strongly points towards disseminated coccidioidomycosis.",Answer: Disseminated coccidioidomycosis.,N,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms and history point toward a potential infection by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes plague. The sudden onset of a rash during a hiking trip in the southwestern United States, along with the development of painful inguinal swelling, are consistent with the presentation of a bubonic plague, one of the forms of plague, which often begins with a flea bite. The bacteria spread to the lymph nodes (forming a 'bubo' which can cause painful swelling), and can then disseminate to other areas of the body, causing septicemic plague. The patient's severe dyspnea, productive cough with blood streaks, confusion, and low blood pressure suggest the bacteria might have spread to the lungs, causing secondary pneumonic plague. The presence of rales in the lower lobe of the left lung and the severe systemic symptoms further support this. The systemic spread of the bacteria can also cause septic shock, as evidenced by the patient's low blood pressure and rapid heart rate.",Answer: Bubonic plague,Y,"Rationale: Without the specific picture or scan to guide the analysis, we would look at the symptoms and history presented for the patient to perform a Bayesian analysis. The prior probability of Yersinia pestis infection, which causes the plague, is extremely low given its rarity in the modern world. However, the patient has been hiking in areas of the southwestern USA, including Arizona and New Mexico, which is known for occasional cases of the plague from rodents, increasing the probability to say 5%.

Next, the symptoms of the severe, sudden onset inguinal swelling, known as a bubo, also align with a Yersinia pestis infection, especially given the lack of overlying erythema or cellulitis, which could suggest another infection, increasing the posterior probability to perhaps 30%.

Moreover, the patient has a fever and is confused, which can be indicative of a severe systemic infection such as the plague, increasing the probability further to 40%.

The patient also presents with respiratory symptoms including dyspnea and a productive cough with blood, which can be a sign of pneumonic plague, a form of the disease that affects the lungs and is more severe. This increases the probability further to 60%.

This Bayesian analysis suggests that while the plague is generally a rare disease, the specific circumstances, history, and symptoms of this patient significantly increase the likelihood that this is indeed the diagnosis. It's important to note that this is a general approximation and exact probability numbers can vary based on more detailed epidemiological data, but this approach outlines the thought process behind using Bayesian analysis to assess diagnostic probabilities.",Answer: Yersinia pestis infection,Y
"A 44-year-old man presents to the family medicine clinic for some small bumps on his left thigh. The lesions are non-pruritic and have been present for the last 3 weeks. He reports feeling fatigued and malaise for the past few months. The patient has no known medical problems and takes no medications. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and uses intravenous street drugs. His heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, the temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), and the blood pressure is 126/80 mm Hg. Auscultation of the heart is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Three 2-3 mm, dome-shaped, hardened papules are noted on the left thigh. Central umbilication can be observed in each papule.

Molluscum contagiosum is a common infection, especially in children, but can also be seen in adults. It is usually harmless and self-limiting but can be more widespread and last much longer in people with immune deficiencies. The patient's use of intravenous street drugs may put him at a higher risk for HIV, which can cause immune deficiency, and this could be causing his fatigue and malaise as well as the more severe molluscum contagiosum infection.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is consistent with skin lesions caused by a viral infection. The differential diagnosis includes: molluscum contagiosum, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, human papillomavirus, and syphilis. The physical findings of dome-shaped papules with central umbilication are characteristic of molluscum contagiosum. This is a skin infection caused by a poxvirus. It is spread by direct skin-to-skin contact, and can also spread through fomites or can be sexually transmitted. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and unprotected sex could make him more susceptible to this infection. Other conditions on the differential, like syphilis, could also present with lymphadenopathy, but the specific skin findings make molluscum contagiosum the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of fatigue, malaise, and small, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication suggests a diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum is a skin infection caused by a poxvirus. It often presents as small, pearly, flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules that have a central umbilication or ""dimple."" It's commonly seen in children, sexually active adults, and immunocompromised individuals. Given this patient's history of intravenous drug use, which puts him at risk for HIV and other forms of immunocompromise, this increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The cervical lymphadenopathy can also be consistent with a localized infection or systemic viral illness.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: The patient's history of intravenous drug use makes him susceptible to infections, including sexually transmitted infections. The description of the skin lesions - small, dome-shaped, hardened papules with central umbilication - is highly suggestive of Molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection caused by a poxvirus and is typically spread through direct skin-to-skin contact, including sexual contact, or via fomites. The fatigue, malaise, and non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy may suggest systemic involvement or co-infection with another pathogen common in the intravenous drug user population, such as HIV.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of molluscum contagiosum, a viral infection caused by a poxvirus, in a healthy individual might be considered quite low, let's say 1%. However, given the patient's history of intravenous drug use, the posterior probability may increase, because drug use can involve shared needles and intimate contact, both of which are modes of transmission for the virus. This could potentially increase the probability to 20%. The specific clinical presentation of dome-shaped, umbilicated papules is characteristic of molluscum contagiosum and further increases the probability to 70%. The presence of fatigue and malaise might suggest a more systemic issue, but in the absence of other symptoms, these are non-specific and do not greatly alter the probability. The non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy could represent a response to a localized infection, such as the skin lesions observed. This could increase the probability of molluscum contagiosum to about 80%. Given the specific nature of the skin findings, the risk factors, and the absence of significant findings pointing to another diagnosis, this patient most likely has molluscum contagiosum.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y

"A 32-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her friend for acute onset abdominal pain. She states that she was in a kickboxing class when she suddenly developed left-sided abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for chlamydia. She is currently sexually active and does not use contraception. Her menstrual periods occur regularly every 30 days. Her last menstrual period ended 2 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ruptured ovarian cyst,Pelvic inflammatory disease,N,Pelvic inflammatory disease,N,Ectopic pregnancy,N,Ectopic pregnancy,N,Pelvic inflammatory disease,N,,"Rationale: This patient's sudden onset of abdominal pain during a kickboxing class, along with the finding of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch on ultrasound, suggests a gynecological emergency. Given her history of chlamydia, which can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, and her sexual activity without contraception, an ectopic pregnancy is a possibility. However, her last menstrual period ended just 2 days ago, which makes ectopic pregnancy less likely. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a ruptured ovarian cyst. The rupture can cause sudden, severe pain and lead to the accumulation of fluid in the rectouterine pouch.",Answer: Ruptured ovarian cyst,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, ruptured ovarian cyst, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and appendicitis. The patient's history of chlamydia and lack of contraception use increases her risk for ectopic pregnancy and PID. However, her regular menstrual periods and the fact that her last period ended just 2 days ago make ectopic pregnancy less likely. The sudden onset of pain during physical activity, the localized left-sided lower abdominal pain and guarding, and the ultrasound finding of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch are all suggestive of a ruptured ovarian cyst.",Answer: Ruptured ovarian cyst,Y,"Rationale: This patient's acute onset of left-sided abdominal pain during physical activity, along with the finding of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch on ultrasound, is suggestive of a ruptured ovarian cyst. The fact that she is in the middle of her menstrual cycle (her last period ended 2 days ago, and she has a 30-day cycle) supports this diagnosis, as ovulation typically occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle and can cause a functional ovarian cyst to rupture. The rupture can lead to sudden, severe pain and internal bleeding, which can cause fluid accumulation in the rectouterine pouch (also known as the pouch of Douglas). The patient's history of chlamydia and unprotected sex also puts her at risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), but PID usually presents with bilateral adnexal tenderness and abnormal vaginal discharge, which are not reported in this case.",Answer: Ruptured ovarian cyst,Y,"Rationale: This patient's acute onset of abdominal pain during physical activity, along with the findings of adnexal tenderness and fluid in the rectouterine pouch on ultrasound, are highly suggestive of a gynecological emergency. Given her history of chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection that can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, and the fact that she is sexually active without using contraception, an ectopic pregnancy should be considered. However, her last menstrual period ended just 2 days ago, which makes ectopic pregnancy less likely. Another possibility is ovarian torsion, which can occur spontaneously or be triggered by physical activity. Ovarian torsion is a gynecological emergency that can cause severe abdominal pain and is associated with the presence of an ovarian cyst or mass, which can cause the ovary to twist. The twisting can cut off the blood supply to the ovary, leading to ischemia and necrosis if not promptly treated. The presence of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch could be due to hemorrhage from the necrotic ovary. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is ovarian torsion.",Answer: Ovarian torsion,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of an ovarian cyst rupture is about 5% in women of reproductive age. The patient's history of sudden onset of left-sided abdominal pain during physical activity increases the probability of an ovarian cyst rupture to 20%. The patient's history of chlamydia, which can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and increase the risk of ovarian cysts, further increases the probability to 30%. The presence of left-sided lower abdominal tenderness and guarding on physical exam increases the probability to 50%. The finding of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch on ultrasound, which is consistent with a ruptured ovarian cyst, increases the probability to 70%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a ruptured ovarian cyst.",Answer: Ruptured ovarian cyst,Y
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Tracheobronchial rupture,Tension pneumothorax,N,Tension pneumothorax,N,Recurrent pneumothorax,N,Bronchopleural fistula,Y,Tension pneumothorax,N,,"Rationale: This patient was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident and has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5, indicating severe brain injury. He was intubated and found to have subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area, a sign of air leaking into the subcutaneous tissue, often from a ruptured airway or lung. A pneumothorax was initially managed with needle decompression and chest tube placement. However, a repeat chest radiograph shows a recurrent pneumothorax despite the chest tube being in place. This suggests that there is an ongoing air leak, most likely from a tracheobronchial injury, which is a known complication of blunt chest trauma.",Answer: Tracheobronchial injury,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: recurrent pneumothorax, hemothorax, chest tube malfunction, bronchopleural fistula, and lung laceration. Given the history of trauma and the presence of subcutaneous emphysema, a bronchopleural fistula is a likely cause. This condition can occur when there is a communication between the bronchial tree and the pleural space, often due to trauma. The presence of a recurrent pneumothorax despite chest tube placement further supports this diagnosis, as the air continues to leak into the pleural space from the bronchial tree.",Answer: Bronchopleural fistula,Y,"Rationale: This patient was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident and has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5, indicating severe brain injury. He was found to have subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area, a sign of air leakage from the lung or airway into the subcutaneous tissue, often due to trauma. He was treated with needle decompression and chest tube placement, which are standard treatments for pneumothorax. However, despite these interventions and initial resolution of the pneumothorax, a repeat chest radiograph shows a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube still in place. This suggests that there is an ongoing air leak, likely due to a bronchopleural fistula. A bronchopleural fistula is an abnormal connection between the bronchial tree and the pleural space, which can occur due to trauma, surgery, or lung disease. It can lead to persistent or recurrent pneumothorax even with a chest tube in place.",Answer: Bronchopleural fistula,Y,"Rationale: This patient was involved in a high-impact motor vehicle collision, which can cause significant trauma to the chest and lungs. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema suggests air leakage from the lung or airway into the subcutaneous tissue, which is often associated with pneumothorax. Despite the placement of a chest tube and initial resolution of the pneumothorax, the patient has developed a recurrent pneumothorax. This suggests that there is ongoing air leakage from the lung, which could be due to a bronchial tear or a traumatic lung injury that has not yet sealed. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a bronchial tear or persistent traumatic lung injury.",Answer: Bronchial tear,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of a bronchopleural fistula in this context is around 10%. The patient's history of a severe motor vehicle collision increases the posterior probability to 20%. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema further increases the probability to 40%. The fact that the patient needed a chest tube placement and needle decompression raises the probability to 60%. Finally, the recurrent pneumothorax despite the chest tube being in place significantly increases the probability to 90%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a bronchopleural fistula.",Answer: Bronchopleural fistula,Y
"A 38-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaint of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain for the past 2 hours. She states that she has experienced similar pain in the past. These episodes occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Gastric peptic ulcer,Peptic ulcer disease,Y,GERD,N,Peptic ulcer disease,Y,Peptic Ulcer Disease,Y,Peptic ulcer disease,Y,,"Rationale: This patient presents with epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that occurs mostly after meals and subsides several hours after eating. This pattern of symptoms suggests a digestive issue, possibly related to the stomach or upper small intestine. The patient's history of smoking and occasional alcohol use are risk factors for several gastrointestinal conditions. Additionally, the patient has been taking over-the-counter painkillers for chronic knee pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used as over-the-counter painkillers, are known to cause gastrointestinal issues, including peptic ulcers. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is a peptic ulcer.",Answer: Peptic ulcer,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gallstones, pancreatitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that occur mostly after meals and subside several hours after eating are suggestive of peptic ulcer disease. The fact that she avoids eating due to the pain and has lost weight further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, her use of over-the-counter painkillers, which are often nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), could contribute to peptic ulcer disease as these medications can irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of ulcers. Her smoking habit could also increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is peptic ulcer disease.",Answer: Peptic ulcer disease,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of postprandial epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that often subside several hours after eating, along with weight loss due to avoidance of eating, suggest a peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The fact that she is a smoker and takes over-the-counter painkillers (which are often nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs) further supports this diagnosis, as both smoking and NSAID use are risk factors for PUD.",Answer: Peptic ulcer disease,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of postprandial epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that subsides several hours after eating, along with weight loss due to avoidance of eating, suggest a peptic ulcer disease (PUD). PUD is often caused by Helicobacter pylori infection or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use. Given her history of chronic knee pain and use of over-the-counter painkillers, it's likely that she's been taking NSAIDs, which can cause gastric mucosal damage and lead to PUD. Smoking and occasional alcohol use are also risk factors for PUD. The absence of findings on the abdominal exam does not rule out PUD, as physical examination is often normal in these patients.",Answer: Peptic ulcer disease,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of peptic ulcer disease in this patient is about 10% given her age and symptoms. The fact that she experiences pain after meals increases the probability of peptic ulcer disease to 30%. The pain subsiding several hours after eating further increases the probability to 50%. Her history of smoking, which is a known risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, increases the probability to 70%. Lastly, her use of over-the-counter painkillers, which are often nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can cause peptic ulcers, increases the probability to 90%. Therefore, this patient most likely has peptic ulcer disease.",Answer: Peptic ulcer disease,Y
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. The cervical os is closed. Urine β-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pseudocyesis,Early pregnancy,N,Early pregnancy.,N,Pregnancy,N,Normal pregnancy,N,False-positive pregnancy,N,,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency. However, the urine beta-hCG test, which is a highly sensitive and specific test for pregnancy, is negative. Additionally, transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, ruling out both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy. Given her symptoms in the absence of a positive pregnancy test or ultrasound findings, the most likely diagnosis is pseudocyesis, also known as false or phantom pregnancy, where a non-pregnant person has many of the symptoms and signs of pregnancy.",Answer: Pseudocyesis,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: pregnancy, pseudocyesis (false pregnancy), urinary tract infection, and ovarian cysts. The patient's symptoms such as breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency are suggestive of pregnancy. However, the negative urine _-hCG and the absence of any findings on transvaginal ultrasonography rule out pregnancy. Urinary tract infection could cause urinary frequency, but it does not explain the other symptoms. Ovarian cysts could cause abdominal enlargement, but they would be visible on ultrasonography. Pseudocyesis, also known as false pregnancy, is a condition in which a non-pregnant woman believes that she is pregnant, and her body may exhibit symptoms consistent with pregnancy. This condition is often associated with psychological factors. Given the patient's symptoms, the negative pregnancy test, and the absence of any findings on ultrasonography, pseudocyesis is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Pseudocyesis,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency. However, her urine _-hCG test, which is a highly sensitive and specific test for pregnancy, is negative. Additionally, transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, ruling out both intrauterine and ectopic pregnancy. Given her symptoms in the absence of a confirmed pregnancy, the most likely diagnosis is pseudocyesis, also known as false or phantom pregnancy. Pseudocyesis is a condition in which a non-pregnant woman believes that she is pregnant, showing many of the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, but this belief is based on misinterpretation of physical signs or symptoms.",Answer: Pseudocyesis,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms suggestive of pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency. However, her urine _-hCG test is negative, and transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, which rules out pregnancy. Given her symptoms and the negative pregnancy test, the most likely diagnosis is pseudocyesis, also known as false or phantom pregnancy. Pseudocyesis is a condition where a woman has the belief that she is pregnant, along with the physical signs and symptoms associated with pregnancy, but there is no actual pregnancy. It is a rare and complex psychological condition, often related to emotional or psychological issues.",Answer: Pseudocyesis,Y,"Rationale: Initially, given the symptoms of breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency, we might assign a relatively high prior probability to pregnancy in this 34-year-old woman who has been trying to conceive. However, the negative urine beta-hCG test, which is highly sensitive for detecting pregnancy, significantly decreases the likelihood of pregnancy. Additionally, the transvaginal ultrasonography showing no abnormalities also further lowers the likelihood of a pregnancy. Given that the signs and symptoms could be psychological, and taking into consideration the negative tests, the likelihood for a pseudocyesis (false pregnancy) becomes higher.

Step 1: Assign a high prior probability to pregnancy based on symptoms (e.g., 70%).
Step 2: Decrease probability of pregnancy significantly based on negative urine beta-hCG (e.g., to 10%).
Step 3: Further decrease probability of pregnancy based on transvaginal ultrasonography showing no abnormalities (e.g., to 5%).
Step 4: With pregnancy becoming highly unlikely, the likelihood for pseudocyesis becomes higher as it can present with similar symptoms due to psychological factors (e.g., increase probability of pseudocyesis to 60%).",Answer: Pseudocyesis,Y
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her right thigh. She initially thought it was an insect bite, but it has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule. When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. A photograph of the lesion is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Dermatofibroma,Dermatofibroma,Y,Dermatofibroma,Y,Molluscum contagiosum,N,Dermatofibroma,Y,Dermatofibroma,Y,,"Rationale: The patient presents with a painless, hyperpigmented papule that has been increasing in size. The characteristic finding where the surface of the skin lesion retracts inwards when squeezed is known as the ""dimpling sign"" or ""Fitzpatrick sign."" This is a hallmark of dermatofibroma. Dermatofibroma is a benign skin condition where there is a growth of excess fibrous tissue. It often presents as a firm, hyperpigmented nodule or papule, and can resemble an insect bite. It is usually benign and typically does not require treatment unless it becomes painful or bothersome.",Answer: Dermatofibroma,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient's skin lesion includes: melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, and seborrheic keratosis. Given the patient's description of a painless, nonpruritic, and slowly growing hyperpigmented papule, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma are less likely, as they tend to present with more alarming features such as rapid growth, irregular borders, or changes in color. Dermatofibromas are benign skin lesions that are usually brownish in color, and when they are squeezed, a dimple forms as the skin retracts inwards. This is known as the 'dimple sign' or 'Fitzpatrick sign', which is characteristic of dermatofibromas. Seborrheic keratosis tends to be more superficial and does not exhibit the dimpling sign. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is a dermatofibroma.",Answer: Dermatofibroma,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with a painless, nonpruritic, hyperpigmented papule on her thigh that has been slowly increasing in size over the course of a month. A very characteristic sign mentioned is that when the lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. This is known as the ""dimple sign"" or ""Fitzpatrick sign"", and it is classically associated with dermatofibroma. Dermatofibromas are benign fibrous nodules and are generally harmless. They are typically hyperpigmented and may be mistaken for a mole or other skin growth. No other symptoms, signs, or laboratory findings are presented that would suggest an alternative diagnosis.",Answer: Dermatofibroma,Y,"Rationale: The patient in this scenario presents with a painless, nonpruritic, hyperpigmented papule that has been growing over a month and demonstrates a �dimpling� effect (retraction of the surface inwards) when squeezed. This dimpling effect, also known as the ""Fitzpatrick sign"" or ""buttonhole sign"", is suggestive of a dermatofibroma. Dermatofibromas are common benign skin nodules that typically present as firm, hyperpigmented papules and are thought to arise from fibroblasts. They are generally harmless and often found on the extremities. The slow increase in size and the specific characteristics described align with a dermatofibroma.",Answer: Dermatofibroma,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of the lesion being a dermatofibroma is 5%. The fact that the lesion is painless, nonpruritic and has been increasing in size makes dermatofibroma more likely, raising the probability to 20%. The woman�s age (38) falls into the common age range for dermatofibromas, further increasing the probability to 30%. The lesion being hyperpigmented raises the probability to 40%. The significant finding that the surface of the skin lesion retracts inwards upon squeezing, known as the ""dimple sign,"" is highly characteristic of dermatofibroma, which makes the diagnosis very likely and increases the probability to over 80%. Considering these factors together, the most likely diagnosis is dermatofibroma.",Answer: Dermatofibroma,Y
"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient's responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. What is the most likely intoxication in this patient?",Marijuana,Stimulant intoxication,N,Stimulant intoxication,N,Stimulant intoxication,N,Stimulant intoxication,N,Stimulant intoxication,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 25-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department for acting strangely in a public setting. He is anxious, and his responses are slightly delayed with difficulty in processing thoughts. The physical examination reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection (red eyes), which are common signs of marijuana use. He has tachycardia, which can also be associated with marijuana use. He denies any substance use but the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of intoxication. Given the presentation of anxiety, dry mouth, red eyes, tachycardia, and altered mental processing, the most likely intoxication in this patient is marijuana.",Answer: Marijuana intoxication,Y,"Rationale: In the case of the 25-year-old man who was brought to the emergency department, the differential diagnosis for his presentation includes anxiety disorder, intoxication with a substance (such as alcohol, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, or synthetic cannabinoids), medication side effects, or another psychiatric disorder.

Given that the patient was at a social event and acting strangely according to other patrons, this raises suspicion for substance use. His physical exam reveals a few clues: he has conjunctival injection (redness of the eyes), dry mouth, tachycardia (elevated heart rate), and appears anxious. Conjunctival injection and dry mouth are common with cannabis use. His slightly delayed responses and difficulty processing thoughts can also be suggestive of cannabis intoxication. While stimulants can cause anxiety and tachycardia, they would typically not cause conjunctival injection and dry mouth.

Alcohol intoxication usually presents with impaired coordination and slurred speech, which is not mentioned here. Hallucinogens can cause altered mental status but are usually accompanied by hallucinations. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a presentation similar to cannabis but are often associated with more severe agitation and psychosis. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely cause of his symptoms is cannabis intoxication.",Answer: Cannabis intoxication,Y,"Rationale: This 25-year-old man presents with anxiety, delayed responses, difficulty in processing thoughts, dry mouth, conjunctival injection (red eyes), and tachycardia. These symptoms are suggestive of intoxication with a psychoactive substance. The combination of anxiety, conjunctival injection, dry mouth, and tachycardia are classic signs associated with cannabis use. Cannabis can cause euphoria, altered perceptions, and anxiety, particularly in social settings. It can also cause conjunctival injection and dry mouth due to its effect on the parasympathetic nervous system. The patient's denial of substance use does not rule out intoxication as patients may not always be forthcoming about drug use, especially when questioned in a setting where they may feel scrutinized or judged.",Answer: Cannabis intoxication,Y,"Rationale: This 25-year-old man presented with anxiety, delayed responses, difficulty in processing thoughts, dry mouth, conjunctival injection, and tachycardia. These symptoms are suggestive of intoxication with a psychoactive substance. The conjunctival injection (redness of the eyes) and dry mouth are classic signs associated with cannabis use. Cannabis can cause a state of euphoria and altered perception which might explain the strange behavior reported by other patrons at the event. Additionally, cannabis can cause an increase in heart rate (tachycardia), anxiety, and impair cognitive functions which correlate with the patient's presentation.",Answer: Cannabis intoxication,Y,"Rationale: In this scenario, the prior probability of the patient being intoxicated with a substance might be relatively high, given the context of being at a local celebration and acting strangely. Let's consider a few substances:

Alcohol: But his neurological exam is relatively intact, which makes alcohol less likely.
Stimulants (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines): The patient has tachycardia, anxiety, and seems to have difficulty processing thoughts. This increases the likelihood of stimulants, but he does not have high blood pressure which is commonly seen with stimulant use.
Marijuana: The patient has conjunctival injection (red eyes), anxiety, tachycardia, and a dry mouth. These are all symptoms that are consistent with marijuana intoxication. Each of these symptoms increases the likelihood of marijuana being the substance involved.
Let�s start with a prior probability of marijuana intoxication of, say, 20%. The conjunctival injection might increase the probability to 40%. The anxiety and tachycardia might further increase it to 60%. The dry mouth might increase the probability to around 80%.

Combining this information, marijuana intoxication seems to be the most likely cause of this patient�s presentation.",Answer: Marijuana intoxication,Y
"A 52-year-old man presents to the physician because of ongoing shortness of breath, which is more prominent when he lies down. Occasionally, he experiences palpitations, especially during strenuous activities. In addition to this, he has been experiencing difficulty in digestion and often experiences regurgitation and dysphagia. He reports that he emigrated from Mexico 20 years ago and visits his hometown twice a year. The vital signs include: blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19/min, and pulse 100/min. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention along with pitting edema in the ankles. Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are heard on auscultation of the chest. A chest X-ray is taken. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no significant findings. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s physical and diagnostic findings?",Parasitic infection,Chagas disease,Y,Chagas disease,Y,Right-sided heart failure.,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Chagas disease,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is presenting with symptoms of shortness of breath, palpitations, difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, and dysphagia. The physical exam shows jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, bilateral basilar crackles, and an S3 gallop on chest auscultation. These findings are indicative of congestive heart failure. Additionally, the patient�s history of emigrating from Mexico, and frequent visits back, raises the possibility of Chagas disease, which is endemic in parts of Mexico. Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, can lead to chronic cardiomyopathy and the symptoms that the patient is experiencing. Given the patient�s history and presenting symptoms, it is likely that he has Chagas cardiomyopathy leading to congestive heart failure.",Answer: Chagas cardiomyopathy,Y,"Rationale: The patient�s symptoms including shortness of breath (especially when lying down), palpitations, difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, dysphagia, jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are indicative of heart failure. These symptoms can be caused by various conditions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, constrictive pericarditis, or Chagas disease. The fact that the patient emigrated from Mexico and frequently visits his hometown makes Chagas disease a strong consideration, as it is endemic in Latin America. Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, which can result in chronic cardiomyopathy. The chronic cardiomyopathy seen in Chagas disease can manifest as dilated cardiomyopathy leading to the clinical picture of heart failure, which aligns with the patient�s symptoms and physical findings. In this context, Chagas disease is the most likely explanation for this patient's physical and diagnostic findings.",Answer: Chagas disease,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with shortness of breath which worsens when lying down (orthopnea), palpitations, difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, dysphagia, jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, bilateral basilar crackles, and an S3 gallop. These symptoms and signs are indicative of heart failure, specifically congestive heart failure (CHF). The combination of jugular venous distention, pitting edema, and crackles in the lungs is typical of fluid overload seen in CHF. The orthopnea and S3 gallop are also classic signs of heart failure. Additionally, the patient has a history of travel to Mexico, where Chagas disease is endemic. Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, can lead to chronic cardiomyopathy, which in turn can cause congestive heart failure. The difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, and dysphagia can be explained by the involvement of the esophagus and GI tract in Chagas disease, which is known as megaesophagus and megacolon. Considering the patient's history of travel to an endemic area and the constellation of symptoms, Chagas disease leading to congestive heart failure is the most likely explanation for the patient�s physical and diagnostic findings.",Answer: Chagas disease,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms of shortness of breath that worsens when lying down, palpitations during activity, difficulty in digestion, regurgitation, dysphagia, jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, bilateral basilar crackles, and an S3 gallop. These findings suggest that the patient is suffering from congestive heart failure, which is supported by the S3 gallop and jugular venous distension. However, the difficulty in digestion and dysphagia indicate that there is an additional complication. The fact that the patient emigrated from Mexico and continues to visit frequently raises the possibility of Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. This disease is endemic in Latin America, including Mexico. Chagas disease can cause chronic heart problems including heart failure, arrhythmias, and can also affect the esophagus and colon causing difficulty in swallowing and digestion. The chronic form of Chagas disease leads to dilated cardiomyopathy which can be the underlying cause of the patient�s congestive heart failure and the esophageal symptoms.",Answer: Chagas disease,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of constrictive pericarditis is about 2% in the general population. However, this patient is presenting with shortness of breath, especially when lying down, which is characteristic of constrictive pericarditis, increasing the probability to 10%. The palpitations during activity can also be attributed to constrictive pericarditis, further increasing the probability to 20%. The presence of difficulty in digestion along with regurgitation and dysphagia indicates impaired diastolic filling, which is seen in constrictive pericarditis, making the probability go up to 30%. The fact that the patient is from Mexico, where tuberculosis is endemic and tuberculosis is a cause of constrictive pericarditis, raises the probability to 50%. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, bilateral basilar crackles, and an S3 gallop which are classic signs of constrictive pericarditis, taking the probability to 70%. This patient most likely has constrictive pericarditis.",Answer: Constrictive Pericarditis,N
"A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath that is worse when she lies on her left side. About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Atrial myxoma,Left atrial myxoma,Y,Left atrial myxoma,Y,Atrial myxoma,Y,Atrial myxoma,Y,Atrial myxoma,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is a 41-year-old woman who is experiencing shortness of breath that worsens when she lies on her left side. She also had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness approximately 10 days ago. The presence of a diastolic murmur that is prominent when she lies on her left side, along with jugular venous distention and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray, suggest a cardiac issue. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium that is attached to the atrial septum. This combination of findings is indicative of a cardiac tumor. The most common type of primary cardiac tumor is an atrial myxoma, which often arises from the atrial septum and can cause symptoms due to obstruction of blood flow and embolization.",Answer: Atrial myxoma,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes constrictive pericarditis, congestive heart failure, atrial myxoma, pulmonary embolism, and mitral stenosis. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, especially when lying on her left side, and diastolic murmur are indicative of a cardiac issue. The finding of a mass in the left atrium on 2-dimensional echocardiogram narrows the possibilities. While congestive heart failure could explain some of the symptoms, it wouldn't account for the mass in the left atrium. Constrictive pericarditis could cause some of the symptoms, but is less likely given the mass. Pulmonary embolism could cause shortness of breath but does not explain the diastolic murmur or the mass. Mitral stenosis can cause similar symptoms, but again the mass in the left atrium points us to a different diagnosis. Atrial myxoma is a benign tumor in the heart, and it is often located in the left atrium. It can cause symptoms of heart failure, and when it obstructs blood flow, it can cause syncope which might explain the unexplained loss of consciousness 10 days ago. The presence of the mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum is very characteristic of atrial myxoma.",Answer: Atrial myxoma,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a 41-year-old woman who presents with shortness of breath that worsens when she lies on her left side. She also had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness approximately 10 days ago. On clinical examination, she has a diastolic murmur that is more pronounced when lying on the left side, jugular venous distention, and fine crackles in the chest which indicate fluid in the lungs. Chest X-ray reveals pulmonary congestion, and a 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. The combination of symptoms including a diastolic murmur, jugular venous distention, pulmonary congestion, and a mass in the left atrium are highly suggestive of a cardiac tumor, most likely an atrial myxoma. Atrial myxomas are the most common type of primary cardiac tumors and often present with a triad of symptoms including obstructive, embolic, and constitutional. In this case, the mass is obstructing the blood flow which can lead to shortness of breath, pulmonary congestion, and possibly syncope (loss of consciousness).",Answer: Atrial myxoma,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with shortness of breath, diastolic murmur that is worse when lying on the left side, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray. These symptoms indicate some form of cardiac pathology. The presence of a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum, as evidenced by 2-dimensional echocardiogram, gives further clues to the diagnosis. The clinical picture suggests that the mass may be obstructing the mitral valve leading to blood backflow and congestive symptoms such as pulmonary congestion. Such a mass in the left atrium could be a myxoma, which is a primary benign tumor of the heart. Myxomas are typically attached by a stalk and can move, causing obstruction of the blood flow within the heart, leading to syncope, and congestive heart failure symptoms such as dyspnea and pulmonary edema. They can also cause a diastolic murmur due to the obstruction of the mitral valve. In this patient, the episode of unexplained loss of consciousness could be due to transient obstruction of the mitral valve by the tumor, and the symptoms, including the murmur and shortness of breath, are likely due to the atrial myxoma.",Answer: Atrial myxoma,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of a cardiac tumor, such as atrial myxoma, in a patient with no significant past medical history or family history is relatively low. However, in this scenario, we have a patient presenting with shortness of breath that worsens when lying on the left side, which could be indicative of a mass effect in the left atrium (posterior probability increases). The presence of a diastolic murmur that is prominent when the patient lies on her left side further increases the likelihood that there is an obstruction in the left atrium (probability increases further). Jugular venous distention is indicative of impaired filling of the right heart, which can occur due to a mass impeding blood flow (probability increases). The presentation of pulmonary congestion on a chest X-ray is a sign of left-sided heart failure, which could be due to an obstruction in the left atrium (probability increases). The most definitive piece of evidence is the 2-dimensional echocardiogram that shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum, which is characteristic of an atrial myxoma (probability increases substantially).",Answer: Atrial Myxoma,Y
"A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h
An excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Classical Hodgkin s lymphoma  HL ,HIV-associated lymphadenopathy,N,Lymphoma,N,Lymphoma,N,Lymphoma,N,Lymphoma,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 25-year-old man with a known history of HIV infection. He presents with painless swelling of the neck due to enlarged lymph nodes. This is a common symptom in patients with compromised immune systems, like those with HIV. The fact that the patient's lymph nodes are enlarged, non-tender, and he has not experienced B symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, or weight loss, points towards a chronic process. In HIV patients, there is a higher likelihood of developing certain malignancies, including lymphomas. One of the most common types of lymphoma in HIV patients is Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In addition, the high erythrocyte sedimentation rate is an indication of chronic inflammation which is consistent with lymphoma. The history and clinical presentation are highly suggestive of lymphoma in this HIV-positive patient.",Answer: Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma,N,"Rationale: In this scenario, the patient is a 25-year-old man with a history of HIV infection presenting with painless swelling of the neck. The differential diagnosis for generalized lymphadenopathy in a patient with HIV includes infections such as tuberculosis or fungal infections, lymphoma, and medication-induced lymphadenopathy. The absence of fevers, night sweats, and weight loss makes an infection less likely. Considering the patient's history of HIV, lymphoma, particularly Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, becomes a significant concern. However, phenytoin, which the patient is taking for seizures, is known to cause lymphadenopathy in some cases. For definitive diagnosis, the histopathologic analysis from the excisional biopsy is crucial. If the histopathology shows atypical lymphoid hyperplasia, this could indicate a medication-induced lymphadenopathy. If it shows a monotonous population of large cells with prominent nucleoli and a high mitotic rate, this would indicate lymphoma.

As the question did not provide information on the histopathologic analysis, the answer is based on clinical presentation and history. Lymphoma is more common in patients with HIV, and considering the patient's history and the clinical presentation of multiple, non-tender, bilateral cervical lymph nodes, lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Lymphoma,N,"Rationale: This 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck and has a history of HIV infection. He does not have systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss. The lymph nodes are non-tender. The combination of painless lymphadenopathy in a patient with HIV raises the suspicion for lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma which is more common in HIV-infected individuals. Additionally, the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) could be consistent with an ongoing inflammatory or malignant process such as lymphoma. Though the image is not provided, the histopathological analysis of the excisional biopsy would be crucial in confirming the diagnosis. One would expect to see atypical lymphoid cells if this were a case of lymphoma.",Answer: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,N,"Rationale: The patient is a 25-year-old male with a history of HIV infection and is currently on phenytoin for seizures. He presents with painless swelling in the neck which indicates lymphadenopathy. In patients with HIV infection, the immune system is compromised, making them more susceptible to various infections and malignancies. One of the common conditions associated with HIV is lymphadenopathy. In this case, the fact that the lymph nodes are non-tender, and that there is an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggests a chronic process. Common causes of lymphadenopathy in HIV patients include infections such as mycobacterium, or malignancies like lymphoma. However, the history of phenytoin usage is critical here, as phenytoin is known to cause a reaction known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) which can present with lymphadenopathy. The absence of other symptoms like fevers, night sweats, and weight loss make it less likely to be due to an opportunistic infection or malignancy, and more likely to be due to phenytoin inducing a hypersensitivity reaction causing lymphadenopathy.",Answer: Phenytoin-induced lymphadenopathy,N,"Rationale: We begin with the prior probability of an HIV-infected individual having any sort of lymphadenopathy. Let's say it is 30%.
The patient is 25 years old and presents with painless swelling in the neck, which is characteristic of lymphadenopathy. Given that he has HIV, this increases the probability of an HIV-associated lymphadenopathy to around 50%.
He is on Phenytoin, which does not have a strong association with lymphadenopathy; thus, the probability remains the same.
The lymph nodes are non-tender, and they are in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck, which is characteristic of generalized lymphadenopathy seen in HIV patients. This increases the posterior probability to 60%.
He has an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), which is common in infections and inflammations, consistent with HIV-related lymphadenopathy, raising the probability to 70%.
The fact that there is no fever, night sweats, or weight loss makes it less likely that it is an acute infection or malignancy. The history of HIV without any other strong indicators of another disease process makes HIV-associated lymphadenopathy the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: HIV-associated lymphadenopathy,N
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife for severe abdominal pain for the past 1 hour. He is unable to give more information about the nature of his pain. His wife says that he has peptic ulcer disease and is being treated with antacids without a good response. She adds that he vomited repeatedly  in the last couple of hours, his vomitus being brown/red in color. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. A physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with a board like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. An erect abdominal x-ray is ordered. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Perforated gastric peptic ulcer,Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,Perforated peptic ulcer.,Y,Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,Perforated ulcer,Y,,"Rationale: The patient in question is a 55-year-old man who is experiencing severe abdominal pain, vomiting with brown/red coloration, and has a history of peptic ulcer disease. His physical examination reveals a tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness, which are suggestive of peritonitis. The history of peptic ulcer disease, severe pain, and the vomiting of what seems to be blood (given the coloration) also indicate that there may have been a perforation of a peptic ulcer. When a peptic ulcer perforates, it can lead to the spilling of stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis. This is an emergency situation and is consistent with the signs and symptoms displayed by the patient.",Answer: Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for a patient with severe abdominal pain, history of peptic ulcer disease, vomiting, and signs of peritonitis includes perforated peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal bleed, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and bowel obstruction.

Perforated peptic ulcer: The history of peptic ulcer disease, sudden onset of severe pain, and signs of peritonitis (board-like rigidity, rebound tenderness) are classic for perforated peptic ulcer. The presence of brown/red vomitus also suggests bleeding, which can occur with peptic ulcers.

Gastrointestinal bleed: The presence of brown/red vomitus suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness indicate a more acute process like perforation.

Pancreatitis: Typically presents with severe abdominal pain, but is usually associated with a history of alcohol use or gallstones and does not cause board-like abdominal rigidity.

Cholecystitis: This condition generally causes right upper quadrant pain and would not cause generalized board-like abdominal rigidity.

Bowel obstruction: This might cause abdominal pain and vomiting, but would not usually cause a rigid abdomen unless there was strangulation or perforation.

In this patient, the combination of severe abdominal pain, history of peptic ulcer disease, vomiting with blood, and signs of peritonitis (rigid abdomen, rebound tenderness) strongly suggest a perforated peptic ulcer.",Answer: Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,"Rationale: This 55-year-old man has severe abdominal pain, a history of peptic ulcer disease, and vomiting of brown/red content. His physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. These findings suggest that there is likely perforation of a peptic ulcer, leading to peritonitis. The severe abdominal pain with rigidity and rebound tenderness is consistent with chemical (and possibly bacterial) irritation of the peritoneum due to leakage of stomach or duodenal content into the peritoneal cavity. The brown/red vomitus suggests that there may also be bleeding associated with the ulcer. An erect abdominal x-ray would probably be done to look for free air under the diaphragm, which is indicative of a perforated hollow viscus, in this case, the stomach or duodenum.",Answer: Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,"Rationale: The patient is experiencing severe abdominal pain with a history of peptic ulcer disease. The color of his vomit (brown/red) suggests the possibility of blood, indicating that there may be bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness are classical signs of peritonitis, which may be secondary to a perforation of the gastrointestinal tract. In patients with peptic ulcer disease, an ulcer can erode through the wall of the stomach or duodenum, leading to perforation. This allows the contents of the stomach or small intestine to enter the peritoneal cavity, causing peritonitis. The patient's hypotension (blood pressure 100/68 mm Hg) may also indicate septic shock due to the peritonitis. In this case, it is highly likely that the peptic ulcer has perforated, leading to peritonitis",Answer: Perforated peptic ulcer,Y,"Rationale: We will start with Bayesian inference to deduce the correct response. Initially, let's consider that the prior probability of a perforated peptic ulcer is 5% in a patient with peptic ulcer disease presenting with severe abdominal pain. The presentation of brown/red vomitus indicates the presence of blood, which increases the posterior probability of a perforated peptic ulcer to 25%. The presence of a board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness in the abdomen is highly indicative of peritonitis due to perforation, which further increases the posterior probability to 60%. The hypotension (blood pressure 100/68 mm Hg) can be a sign of sepsis due to the perforation, raising the posterior probability to 80%. Given the severe abdominal pain, history of peptic ulcer disease, signs of peritonitis, and hypotension, the most likely diagnosis is a perforated peptic ulcer.",Answer: Perforated peptic ulcer,Y
"A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
 ",Generalized anxiety disorder,Anxiety disorder,Y,Anxiety disorder,Y,Insomnia,N,Anxiety disorder,Y,Anxiety disorder,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is 35 years old and presents with a chronic history of insomnia. He has been experiencing sleep difficulties since a young age, which implies that this is a long-standing issue. The recent attendance at a sleep conference seems to have heightened his awareness and concern about his health. Additionally, he is worried about paying bills if he falls sick, which indicates that he has excessive worries about future events. His arrival an hour early for the appointment out of fear of missing it and his presentation as irritable, tense, and somewhat inattentive suggest that he is overly anxious. These symptoms of chronic worry, tension, irritability, and sleep disturbances are characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).",Answer: Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes primary insomnia, anxiety disorder, mood disorder, adjustment disorder, or a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. The patient mentions having trouble sleeping from a young age, but his current heightened concern about his health and finances, coupled with his behavior of arriving an hour early due to fear of missing the appointment, suggest heightened worry and tension. This points more towards an anxiety disorder. Primary insomnia usually involves difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, without significant daytime anxiety. Mood disorder usually has a pervasive low mood or anhedonia. Adjustment disorder typically follows a specific stressful life event. Circadian rhythm sleep disorder is usually related to a mismatch between sleep patterns and the demands of the environment. The patient's long-term sleep issue, coupled with excessive worry about various aspects of his life, difficulty in paying attention, tension, and irritability, fit with generalized anxiety disorder.",Answer: Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Y,"Rationale: This 35-year-old patient presents with chronic insomnia, which he has had since a young age, and appears to have excessive worries about his health and finances. He also arrived an hour early for his appointment due to the fear of missing it. These are classic signs of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which is characterized by chronic anxiety and worries that are often unrealistic or out of proportion for the situation. Generalized Anxiety Disorder is diagnosed clinically based on the presentation of excessive anxiety or worry most days for at least 6 months about a number of events or activities. Additionally, the patient appears irritable, tense, and somewhat inattentive during the interview; these are also common symptoms associated with GAD.",Answer: Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with chronic insomnia, excessive worrying about health and financial matters, and tension. The fact that the patient arrived an hour early for the appointment because of the fear of missing it, shows signs of excessive anxiety and worry about everyday matters. The inattentiveness and irritability can also be linked to the constant worrying and inability to relax. Additionally, his symptoms have persisted for more than six months, which also points towards an anxiety disorder. The combination of chronic insomnia, excessive worry, tension, and irritability, is characteristic of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). GAD is a common anxiety disorder characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry, and tension, even when there is little or nothing to provoke it.",Answer: Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in the general population is around 3%. The patient�s history of long-standing insomnia increases the probability of GAD to about 10%. The patient�s excessive worry about multiple domains including health and finances, which is a hallmark of GAD, increases the probability to around 30%. The patient�s hypervigilance in arriving an hour early for the appointment due to fear of missing it suggests excessive anxiety and worry, increasing the probability to 50%. His presentation with irritability and being tense during the interview, which are also symptoms of GAD, further increases the probability to about 70%. Taking into account the patient�s chronic excessive worry, tension, and insomnia with no past medical or psychiatric history, the most likely diagnosis is generalized anxiety disorder.",Answer: Generalized Anxiety Disorder,Y
"A 19-year-old man with a past medical history significant only for facial acne presents with increased inguinal pruritis. Relevant social history includes participation in school wrestling. He has no significant family history. Other than the pruritic rash, a review of systems is negative. On physical examination, there is an erythematous, well-demarcated patch on his left thigh, over his pubic region, and throughout the perineum. The scrotum is spared. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Tinea cruris,Scabies,N,Tinea cruris,Y,Scabies,N,Scabies,N,Tinea cruris,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is a 19-year-old male with an erythematous, well-demarcated rash in the inguinal region and perineum, which is itching. He is also involved in wrestling at school. Given the characteristics of the rash and the history of close skin-to-skin contact through wrestling, the most likely diagnosis is Tinea Cruris (also known as Jock Itch). Tinea Cruris is a fungal infection commonly affecting the groin and adjacent areas, and is frequently seen in athletes and individuals who have increased sweating or wear tight clothing.",Answer: Tinea Cruris,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes tinea cruris (jock itch), contact dermatitis, psoriasis, and herpes simplex infection. Given the patient's participation in wrestling, which involves close physical contact and shared clothing or equipment, there is an increased risk for fungal infections such as tinea cruris. Tinea cruris typically presents with a pruritic, erythematous, well-demarcated rash in the groin area and is often associated with a history of wearing tight or wet clothing. The sparing of the scrotum is also a classic presentation of tinea cruris, and differentiates it from other conditions like contact dermatitis or psoriasis which might not spare the scrotum. The absence of a vesicular rash makes herpes simplex infection less likely. Therefore, based on the patient�s history, physical examination findings, and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is tinea cruris.",Answer: Tinea cruris,Y,"Rationale: This 19-year-old patient presents with an erythematous, well-demarcated patch in the inguinal region and is involved in wrestling. Close skin-to-skin contact, such as that which occurs in wrestling, provides an ideal environment for the transmission of dermatophytes which are fungi causing tinea infections. Tinea cruris, commonly known as jock itch, is a fungal infection that primarily affects the groin and adjacent areas. It presents as an erythematous, well-demarcated rash, typically sparing the scrotum as in this case. The fact that he is involved in wrestling, where this kind of skin infection is common, and the nature of the rash strongly point to tinea cruris as the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Tinea cruris,Y,"Rationale: This 19-year-old man is presenting with an erythematous, well-demarcated rash in his inguinal region. His history of participating in school wrestling is relevant because close physical contact and sharing of mats or equipment can facilitate the spread of skin infections. The rash description is characteristic of tinea cruris, also known as ""jock itch."" Tinea cruris is a fungal infection typically caused by dermatophytes. It tends to affect the groin and thigh areas, often sparing the scrotum, as noted in this patient. The infection is common among athletes and those who sweat profusely. The presentation of a well-demarcated erythematous patch in the inguinal area, particularly in the context of participation in wrestling, is suggestive of tinea cruris.",Answer: Tinea cruris,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Tinea Cruris (Jock Itch) is relatively high in a young adult male, particularly those who are physically active and participate in contact sports like wrestling, let�s assume it�s 20%. The presence of inguinal pruritis increases the posterior probability of Tinea Cruris to around 40%. The fact that there is a well-demarcated erythematous patch, specifically in the thigh and pubic region, increases the probability further to around 60%. The sparing of the scrotum is another feature commonly seen in Tinea Cruris, which further increases the probability to around 80%. Given the clinical presentation and history of wrestling participation, the patient most likely has Tinea Cruris.",Answer: Tinea Cruris,Y
"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",Complement inhibitor deficiency,Anaphylaxis,N,Allergic reaction,N,Allergic reaction,N,Allergic reaction,N,Anaphylaxis,N,,"Rationale: This 12-year-old girl experienced sudden abdominal pain and vomiting, along with facial swelling and redness, following a tooth extraction. She had a similar episode of facial swelling a year ago after trauma, which resolved spontaneously. These symptoms, particularly the recurrent episodes of swelling following trauma or stress (such as a dental procedure), suggest an abnormality in the complement system, which can lead to unregulated activation of some pathways leading to angioedema. Specifically, in this scenario, the findings are indicative of Hereditary Angioedema, a disorder characterized by episodic swelling of the subcutaneous tissues and mucosa due to C1 inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction, leading to increased bradykinin.",Answer: Hereditary Angioedema,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes allergic reaction, angioedema, intestinal obstruction, and hereditary angioedema. The patient's presentation of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and facial swelling following a tooth extraction, coupled with a history of a similar episode after a physical injury, suggests hereditary angioedema. Allergic reactions and angioedema often present with pruritus (itchiness), which is absent in this case, making them less likely. Intestinal obstruction usually doesn't cause facial edema. Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling, commonly affecting the face and the gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms are often triggered by trauma or stress, as seen in this case. The ultrasound finding of segmental thickening of the intestinal wall also supports the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema, which is known to cause gastrointestinal manifestations due to edema of the bowel wall.",Answer: Hereditary angioedema,Y,"Rationale: This patient's sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, redness and swelling of the face and lips without itching following a tooth extraction and similar episode following trauma suggests the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema. Hereditary angioedema is characterized by episodic attacks of edema involving the dermis, subcutaneous tissue, mucosa, and submucosal tissues. It is caused by a deficiency of C1 inhibitor leading to unregulated activation of the classical complement pathway, resulting in increased vascular permeability and edema. Common triggers include trauma and dental procedures. The lack of pruritus helps differentiate it from allergic reactions. The ultrasonographic finding of segmental thickening of the intestinal wall is also consistent with intestinal wall edema, which is common in hereditary angioedema.",Answer: Hereditary angioedema,Y,"Rationale: This 12-year-old patient presents with colicky abdominal pain and vomiting, as well as redness and swelling of the face and lips, which followed a tooth extraction. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a trauma a year ago. The absence of pruritus, and the recurrence of symptoms, particularly after trauma or stress, suggests that this is not an allergic reaction but rather points to hereditary angioedema. Hereditary angioedema is due to a deficiency or dysfunction in C1 esterase inhibitor, which is involved in regulating bradykinin levels. Increased bradykinin leads to increased vascular permeability and results in edema. In her case, the edema is affecting both the face and the intestinal wall, as indicated by the segmental thickening of the intestinal wall in the ultrasound, which could be causing her colicky abdominal pain.",Answer: Hereditary angioedema,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in the general population is very low, however, this patient has a history of facial swelling after trauma, which increases the posterior probability of HAE significantly. Given that she had a similar episode after a dental procedure which is known to potentially trigger HAE attacks, the probability increases further. The presentation of colicky abdominal pain with vomiting and segmental thickening of the intestinal wall as seen on the ultrasound can be associated with HAE, which increases the probability even further. Absence of pruritus differentiates it from allergic angioedema. Taking into account the clinical features, history, and ultrasound findings, this patient most likely has hereditary angioedema.",Answer: Hereditary angioedema,Y
"A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day.

These symptoms are commonly associated with a condition known as Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), a type of inflammatory arthritis. The morning stiffness that improves with exercise is typical of inflammatory back pain, often seen in AS. The patient's eye symptoms are suggestive of anterior uveitis (also known as iritis), which is the most common extra-articular manifestation of AS. Elevated ESR and CRP are also consistent with an inflammatory condition such as AS.",Anterior uveitis,Y,"The differential for this patient could include various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions that affect the eye and joints such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and gout. However, the patient's symptoms of progressive lower back pain that is worse in the morning and improves with activity, heel pain, and acute eye symptoms, combined with the elevated inflammatory markers ESR and CRP, are highly suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. This condition is associated with HLA-B27 antigen positivity and can cause acute anterior uveitis, which would explain the patient's eye symptoms. Therefore, we could expect to find a positive HLA-B27 antigen in this patient.",Positive HLA-B27 antigen,Y,"The patient's sudden onset of severe pain and redness in the eyes, along with visual disturbances, suggest a possible uveitis. The persistent lower back pain, particularly in the morning and improving with movement, along with heel pain suggests inflammatory back disease such as ankylosing spondylitis. These are both common features of spondyloarthritis, a group of related inflammatory disorders. The increased ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) serum levels are indicative of systemic inflammation which is consistent with a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.

AS often presents with a history of chronic lower back pain that improves with activity, along with extra-articular manifestations, such as acute anterior uveitis, which can cause redness, pain, and blurred vision, as seen in this patient. Heel pain can be due to enthesitis, inflammation at the sites where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone, another typical finding in AS. Elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) indicate systemic inflammation, which can also be a part of the AS picture.",Ankylosing Spondylitis,Y,"The prior probability of a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis with associated anterior uveitis is about 1-2% given that the prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis in the general population is relatively low. However, when considering the history of chronic lower back pain, particularly with improvement on movement, the posterior probability increases to approximately 15-20%, as these symptoms are characteristic of the disease. Further, the presence of heel pain, or enthesitis, is another common feature of ankylosing spondylitis, increasing the posterior probability to approximately 35-40%.

The acute onset of severe eye pain and redness, along with visual disturbances, strongly suggests anterior uveitis, a common extra-articular manifestation of ankylosing spondylitis. This significantly increases the posterior probability to around 70-80%. The patient's elevated ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) are general markers of inflammation that could be seen in this disease, further supporting the diagnosis. Given this data, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation is ankylosing spondylitis with associated anterior uveitis.",Anterior uveitis,Y
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",Urethral hypermobility,Stress urinary incontinence,Y,Stress incontinence,Y,Stress urinary incontinence,Y,Stress incontinence,Y,Stress incontinence,Y,,"This patient has urinary incontinence that occurs with increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., exercise, laughter, coughing), but with an absence of a strong desire to void, which is indicative of stress incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence is particularly common in women and is often due to weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue supporting the bladder neck and urethra. Important risk factors include pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and advanced age. The patient has a history of both vaginal delivery and cesarean section, increasing her risk of developing stress incontinence. Her physical examination, which demonstrated leakage of urine on Valsalva maneuver, is consistent with this diagnosis. Also, the normal urinalysis helps rule out other causes of incontinence such as urinary tract infection or bladder stones.",Stress urinary incontinence,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes stress incontinence, urge incontinence, overflow incontinence, and mixed incontinence. Stress incontinence is characterized by leakage of urine during physical activity, coughing, sneezing, or laughing, and is often seen in women who have had vaginal deliveries, which could cause weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. Urge incontinence is characterized by a sudden, intense urge to urinate, followed by an involuntary loss of urine, often related to overactive bladder. Overflow incontinence is characterized by frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely, typically seen in conditions like nerve damage or obstructions in the urinary system. Mixed incontinence is a combination of stress and urge incontinence.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of urinary leakage during athletic exercises and even when she laughs or coughs, along with the observation of leakage during Valsalva maneuver, are typical of stress incontinence. She does not show signs of overactive bladder, such as sudden urges to urinate or frequent urination, which would point towards urge incontinence. There's no mention of constant dribbling of urine or incomplete bladder emptying that might suggest overflow incontinence. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery in the past, which might have contributed to the weakening of her pelvic floor muscles, making stress incontinence the most likely diagnosis.",Stress incontinence,Y,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of stress incontinence. This form of urinary incontinence typically occurs during events that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise. The risk factors for stress incontinence include vaginal childbirth, aging, and certain medications. Given this patient's history of an uncomplicated vaginal delivery and the symptoms of urinary leakage during physical exertion and even while laughing or coughing, this points towards stress incontinence as the most likely cause of her symptoms.",Stress incontinence,Y,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is the involuntary loss of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, laughing, and exercising, as the patient is experiencing. SUI is particularly common in women who have given birth, especially vaginally, as childbirth can cause nerve damage and weaken the pelvic floor muscles supporting the bladder. This is further supported by the observation of urine leakage during the Valsalva maneuver, a typical sign of SUI. Increased fluid intake from water and coffee can also exacerbate symptoms, although they are not the root cause. Other potential causes of urinary incontinence, such as urinary tract infection, overactive bladder, or neurologic disorders, are less likely given the patient's specific symptoms and normal urinalysis.",Stress urinary incontinence,Y,"The prior probability of stress incontinence in a woman of her age is around 10-20%. The patient's history of urinary leakage associated with activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (like coughing, laughing, and exercising) is a classic symptom of stress incontinence, which increases the probability to 40%. The fact that she has given birth vaginally increases the likelihood of stress incontinence, as vaginal delivery can lead to pelvic floor dysfunction, pushing the probability to 60%. Nocturia, which can be a sign of other forms of incontinence, is only mildly present in this patient (waking up once a night to urinate), so it does not significantly affect the probability. The fact that there is visible urine leakage during a Valsalva maneuver further increases the likelihood of stress incontinence to around 80%. Given this information and the lack of other symptoms that might indicate another form of incontinence, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is stress incontinence.",Stress incontinence,Y

Also notable is the sparing of the skin creases, like those of the neck, elbows (cubital fossae), and knees (popliteal fossae). The papular elevations at the base of hair follicles, also known as follicular hyperkeratosis, and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases are other classic findings in ichthyosis vulgaris.",Ichthyosis vulgaris,Y,"The differential diagnosis for a child with dry, scaly skin includes: ichthyosis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis often presents with itching, redness and dry skin which is not present in this case.

Seborrheic dermatitis often presents with red skin and greasy scales, typically on the scalp or inside the ear which also does not match the presentation. The key findings in this case are the generalized fine scales, darkening of palmar and plantar creases and the absence of scales in skin creases of neck and the cubital and popliteal fossae.

Darkening of the palmar and plantar creases can also be a sign of Ichthyosis Vulgaris. The lack of redness, itching, or discharge also supports this diagnosis.

However, the boy has dry, scaly skin that's worse in winter and better in summer, a classic sign of Ichthyosis vulgaris. This feature increases the posterior probability to around 30%. Additionally, the absence of itching, redness, or discharge also aligns with Ichthyosis vulgaris, pushing the probability up to 50%. Upon examination, the boy exhibits generalized fine scales with coarse skin, another key feature of Ichthyosis vulgaris, raising the probability further to 70%. The absence of symptoms in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae, plus the presence of multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases, further suggest Ichthyosis vulgaris, increasing the posterior probability to above 90%.

"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",Cervical trauma,Placenta previa,N,Placenta previa,N,Placenta previa,N,Placenta previa,N,Cervical ectropion,N,,"This patient presents with antepartum bleeding (vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks' gestation) but no pain, tenderness, or signs of placental abruption (such as an uncomfortable or tender abdomen). Also, the fetus is healthy as evidenced by the reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Importantly, ultrasound does not reveal a placenta previa (placenta covering the cervical os). However, she has a history of a previous cesarean section, which can cause the placenta to implant abnormally in subsequent pregnancies, often at the site of the previous scar, known as placenta accreta, increta, or percreta, but these conditions usually cause significant bleeding, which is not evident in this case.

The patient resumed sexual activity recently after avoiding it during her early pregnancy, and the cervix is described as tender and bruised with blood traces. This points to a more benign cause of antepartum bleeding, known as cervical ectropion (or cervical erosion), which is a condition in which the inner lining of the cervix protrudes outwards, making it more prone to trauma and bleeding, especially following sexual intercourse.",Cervical Ectropion,N,"The differential diagnoses for this pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding could include placental abruption, placenta previa, vasa previa, cervicitis, cervical polyp, or cervical cancer. In this case, the ultrasound shows a placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall, which excludes placenta previa (where the placenta covers the cervix) and vasa previa (where fetal blood vessels are present across the cervical os). The patient has a history of HPV, which increases her risk for cervical cancer, but there's no evidence of cervical lesion or mass. Cervical polyp could cause bleeding, but usually they are visually noticeable during the speculum examination. The speculum exam, however, does show a tender, bruised cervix. This, along with the fact that the patient recently resumed sexual activity and her symptoms started afterward, suggest that the most likely cause of the bleeding is trauma to the cervix due to sexual intercourse.",Cervical trauma,Y,"This patient presents with antepartum bleeding, mild pelvic pain, and a tender, bruised cervix, in the absence of any signs of placenta previa or abruptio placenta (such as a tender uterus, non-reassuring fetal heart tracing or abnormally located placenta).

This condition may lead to antepartum bleeding but it's usually minor and resolves without intervention.",Cervical trauma,Y,"This patient presents with painless antepartum bleeding, which suggests a disorder of the placenta. However, the ultrasound finding of a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall rules out placenta previa, which is typically associated with painless bleeding and a placenta that at least partially covers the cervical os. Cervical trauma or infection could also cause bleeding, but these are usually associated with a painful or purulent discharge, respectively, and neither seems likely in this case given her symptoms and history. In this case, the bruised and tender cervix along with the recent history of resumed sexual activity suggest that her symptoms are most likely due to cervical trauma from intercourse.",Cervical trauma from intercourse,Y,"Given the patient's history and symptoms, several causes could account for the antepartum bleeding. However, using Bayesian inference, we can systematically evaluate the likelihood of each possible cause. The prior probability for each potential cause (cervical trauma, placental abruption, placenta previa, and cervical polyp) depends on their prevalence in the general population, the patient's specific risk factors, and the findings from her clinical examination and ultrasound.

Cervical trauma: The prior probability might be around 5%. Given her recent resumption of sexual activity and the findings of a tender, bruised cervix, the posterior probability increases to around 70%.

Placental abruption: The prior probability could be around 1%. However, the patient doesn't have abdominal pain or a tense uterus, and her ultrasound doesn't show a retroplacental clot, leaving the posterior probability at around 1%.

Placenta previa: The prior probability might be around 3%. However, the ultrasound findings show the placenta is located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall, effectively ruling out placenta previa. Thus, the posterior probability drops to near 0%.

Cervical polyp: The prior probability might be around 5%. The absence of a visible polyp during the speculum exam reduces the posterior probability to near 0%.

Based on this Bayesian analysis, the most likely cause of the patient's antepartum bleeding appears to be cervical trauma related to her recent resumption of sexual activity.",Cervical trauma,Y
"A 38-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of three 1-hour episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. During these episodes, she has had nausea and vomiting. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria and is asymptomatic between episodes. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Seven years ago, she underwent resection of the terminal ileum because of severe Crohn's disease. She is 155 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2.

The patient's right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and laboratory results (increased total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT) are indicative of this diagnosis. In addition, the ultrasonography shows a common bile duct of 10mm (normal is less than 6mm), which further supports the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis (gallstone in the CBD).",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: biliary colic, cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, and peptic ulcer disease. Her history of recurrent severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, along with her history of Crohn's disease and terminal ileum resection, increases her risk for gallstones due to the alteration in bile salt absorption. Furthermore, the patient's lab values show elevated total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase which indicates a biliary origin of her symptoms. AST and ALT are also elevated which could be secondary to liver cell injury due to bile duct obstruction.

The abdominal ultrasonography showing a dilated common bile duct (10mm; normal < 6mm) along with the presence of multiple gallstones in the gallbladder, but no evidence of inflammation (no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid), suggests that a gallstone has passed into the common bile duct, causing intermittent obstruction and the clinical picture of biliary colic. However, given the elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis (stones in the common bile duct) is more likely. The intermittent nature of her pain suggests that the stone is moving and not causing a constant obstruction, which would have led to a more severe clinical picture such as ascending cholangitis or acute pancreatitis.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"The patient's symptoms of severe, episodic right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, in combination with the presence of multiple gallstones shown in ultrasonography, suggest biliary colic. However, the elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes (AST, ALT), mild scleral icterus, and an enlarged common bile duct are concerning for choledocholithiasis (stone in the common bile duct), which can lead to obstruction and subsequent cholestasis, causing the laboratory abnormalities. This can occur in patients with gallstones and is more likely in this patient due to the history of terminal ileum resection, which can lead to bile acid malabsorption and subsequently increase the risk for gallstone formation.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"This patient's history of severe Crohn's disease with terminal ileum resection is crucial in explaining the current presentation. The terminal ileum is responsible for bile salt reabsorption; if it is removed or significantly damaged, as in severe Crohn's disease, bile salts aren't adequately reabsorbed. This causes more cholesterol to precipitate out in the gallbladder, leading to gallstone (cholelithiasis) formation. The patient's symptoms (intermittent right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting), labs (elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT), and ultrasound findings (dilated common bile duct and gallstones) are consistent with gallstone migration from the gallbladder into the common bile duct causing choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stone) and resulting in obstructive jaundice and biliary colic.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"The prior probability of choledocholithiasis (common bile duct stones) in a patient with gallstones is around 10-15%. The patient's presentation with severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant (characteristic of biliary colic), along with nausea and vomiting, increases the posterior probability to approximately 35%. Her history of terminal ileum resection for Crohn's disease adds to the probability, since this procedure can result in bile acid malabsorption, leading to the formation of bile duct stones, moving the probability to around 50%.

Laboratory results show elevated bilirubin (4.1 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (348 U/L), indicative of biliary obstruction, which could be caused by choledocholithiasis, further increasing the probability to around 70%. Also, the finding of AST and ALT levels being high increases the probability further to around 80%, since they are typically elevated in biliary obstruction.

Finally, an abdominal ultrasonography shows a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones, which is a strong clinical indicator of choledocholithiasis. This could elevate the probability to nearly 90%. The combination of these signs, symptoms, and test results make choledocholithiasis the most probable cause of this patient's presentation.",Choledocholithiasis,Y

The absence of travel history lessens the likelihood of an infectious cause such as traveler's diarrhea. Working at a nursing home as a caretaker increases her exposure to various infections but not necessarily those causing chronic diarrhea. The colonoscopy findings are also very revealing; the presence of patchy erythema and ulceration in various parts of the colon, along with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates on biopsy, are more consistent with an inflammatory condition. These symptoms and findings together are quite characteristic of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The patchy nature of the inflammation suggests that this is more likely Crohn's disease, which can affect any part of the GI tract and often presents with ""skip lesions"" - areas of inflammation separated by normal tissue.",Crohn's Disease,Y,"The differential for this patient includes infectious colitis (due to organisms like Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, etc.), Crohn's disease, Ulcerative colitis, and ischemic colitis. Given her occupation in a nursing home, one could also consider Clostridium difficile infection, although the absence of antibiotic exposure makes it less likely.

The presence of bloody diarrhea suggests an inflammatory process, and the absence of travel history makes infectious colitis less likely. Ischemic colitis typically affects older individuals and involves the watershed areas of the colon, making it less likely in this case. The colonoscopy findings show patchy inflammation and ulceration in both proximal and distal colon which is more typical of Crohn's disease, but the biopsy report of lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates in the colonic crypts is more typical of ulcerative colitis.

His temperature is low, and the cold extremities despite the ambient temperature being increased could indicate inadequate perfusion due to shock. His low ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) value also suggests inadequate tissue oxygenation, which is often seen in shock states. Given the patient's context, the most likely cause of his presentation is a shock state secondary to his traumatic injuries, possibly a form of distributive shock known as neurogenic shock. This is a type of shock that can occur after severe trauma to the central nervous system, which can disrupt the normal functioning of the autonomic nervous system and lead to poor blood circulation and inadequate tissue oxygenation.",Neurogenic shock,N,"The differential for this patient includes hypothermia, massive hemorrhage, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, tension pneumothorax, or neurogenic shock. The fact that this patient remains hypotensive with low ScvO2 despite adequate resuscitation and no active bleeding points towards a non-hemorrhagic cause of shock. Given that he was stabbed multiple times and his pulse is 80/min (which is relatively low considering his hypotension), one would consider neurogenic shock, which could occur from an injury to the spinal cord disrupting sympathetic nervous system output leading to unopposed parasympathetic activity. This would manifest as hypotension (due to vasodilation) and bradycardia. Other factors such as hypothermia and sepsis should be addressed and ruled out, but his presentation seems to fit best with neurogenic shock, especially given the trauma context.",Neurogenic shock,N,"The patient presents with significant hypotension (blood pressure 50/40 mmHg) and cold extremities despite aggressive resuscitation with blood products and vasopressor support, and no active blood loss reported by the surgical team. Moreover, his temperature is low (hypothermic), and his central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is low, whereas his arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is high. This suggests that despite adequate oxygen being delivered (as indicated by the SaO2), the tissues are not effectively utilizing it - a sign of severe shock, more specifically, metabolic or cellular shock. In this context, the most likely explanation is traumatic shock or severe trauma-related coagulopathy, leading to a systemic inflammatory response that disrupts cellular metabolism.",Traumatic shock,N,"The patient has been subjected to severe trauma and has lost a significant amount of blood, evidenced by the necessity of the massive transfusion protocol. Despite aggressive resuscitation efforts, his vital signs have not improved. Additionally, the surgical team reports no active blood loss. With a SaO2 of 100%, he is receiving sufficient oxygen from the ventilator. However, his ScvO2 is low, which suggests that his tissues are extracting a higher amount of oxygen than usual from the blood. This points towards a decreased cardiac output or circulatory shock state, despite the ""normal"" heart rate (which could be a compensatory mechanism). Furthermore, his low body temperature and cold extremities can be explained by decreased perfusion as a result of the shock state. Given the low blood pressure, normal heart rate, and lack of response to volume resuscitation, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with a form of shock where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively to the body's organs and tissues, such as cardiogenic shock.",Cardiogenic Shock,Y,"In order to determine the most likely cause of this patient's presentation, we must consider each symptom and condition individually, and progressively update our prior belief based on each piece of evidence. This process is the essence of Bayesian inference.

Prior Probability: Considering the patient's multiple stab wounds and extensive blood loss, the prior probability of shock is very high, say around 80%. Shock is a state of cellular and tissue hypoxia due to decreased oxygen delivery, increased oxygen consumption, or inadequate oxygen utilization.

Given the information that the patient has a low blood pressure (50/40 mmHg) and a low temperature (95�F), which are consistent with symptoms of shock, we should update our probability. This evidence can increase our belief that the patient is in shock to, say, 90%.

The information about the high pulse rate (80/min) is also consistent with shock, as the heart is trying to compensate for the lack of blood flow. This could further increase our belief that the patient is in shock to, say, 95%.

Despite aggressive resuscitation and no active blood loss, the patient's vital signs remain the same. Moreover, the patient has a low ScvO2 (Central Venous Oxygen Saturation) which indicates poor oxygen delivery to tissues. This could further increase our belief that the patient is in shock to, say, 97%.

Furthermore, cold extremities indicate poor peripheral perfusion, another sign of shock, further supporting our hypothesis and raising the probability to, say, 99%.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation appears to be shock, specifically distributive shock given the lack of ongoing blood loss, likely secondary to sepsis or anaphylaxis given the context. The exact subtype of shock cannot be determined based solely on the information provided, but our step-by-step Bayesian inference suggests that shock is very likely the underlying issue.",Shock,N

The patient's history of a chronic non-productive cough, fatigue, significant weight loss, and hemoptysis, in addition to the findings of an irregular border lung nodule on imaging, highly suggest a malignant process, specifically lung cancer.",Lung cancer,Y,"The patient presents with several concerning symptoms, including a chronic nonproductive cough, fatigue, significant weight loss, and hemoptysis. These symptoms, along with the presence of an irregular apical lung nodule on imaging, are suggestive of lung cancer. Despite her not having a smoking history, it's important to remember that lung cancer can still occur in non-smokers and in fact, is one of the leading types of cancer in non-smokers. Moreover, African-American women have a higher incidence of lung cancer than women of other racial/ethnic groups. Given these facts, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is lung cancer.",Lung cancer,Y,"The woman presents with a history of hemoptysis, nonproductive cough, fatigue, significant weight loss, and a finding of an irregular apical lung nodule on imaging. These symptoms, along with the radiographic findings, are most consistent with lung cancer. The fact that she is African-American and a non-smoker does not rule out lung cancer; it can occur in non-smokers as well, though the risk is much higher in smokers. The fact that the nodule has irregular borders further increases the suspicion of malignancy, as benign nodules are typically well-circumscribed and have smooth borders. The absence of mediastinal or hilar enlargement does not rule out cancer, as lymphadenopathy might not be present in early stages. Although tuberculosis could potentially present with an apical lung nodule, the patient's lack of relevant exposure history and the slow, chronic course of her symptoms make this less likely.",Lung cancer,Y,"The prior probability of a diagnosis of lung cancer in this patient might be relatively low given that she's not a smoker, let's say 5%. However, she has several risk factors and symptoms that significantly increase the posterior probability. Hemoptysis in this context (especially given the chronicity of her symptoms and the presence of constitutional symptoms like fatigue and weight loss) can increase the posterior probability to 20%. Presence of a lung nodule, especially with irregular borders, further increases the probability to 60%. The absence of any other notable travel history or occupational exposures to explain the symptoms, further pushes the probability towards lung cancer. Considering all this, it seems the most likely diagnosis for this patient is lung cancer.",Lung cancer,Y
"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not attained menarche. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (139 lb); BMI is 22.3 kg/m2. Examination shows normal breast development. Scant axillary hair is present. Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",Androgen insensitivity,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome,N,Turner Syndrome,N,Turner Syndrome,N,Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,Y,MRKH Syndrome,N,,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who has not yet attained menarche, which is unusual as menstruation typically begins around the age of 12-14. She has normal breast development but scant axillary hair, suggesting normal estrogen but lack of androgens. A key clue is the presence of a firm, nontender mass in the left inguinal region. This could be a testis, which is usually located in the scrotum in males. The blind vaginal pouch seen on examination and the absence of uterus and ovaries on ultrasonography further support the idea of a disorder of sexual differentiation. All these signs suggest Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a condition where a genetic male (XY) is resistant to male hormones (androgens). As a result, the person has the physical traits of a woman but the genetic makeup of a man.",Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: Turner syndrome, Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), Mullerian agenesis, and gonadal dysgenesis. Turner syndrome can usually be ruled out by the presence of normal height and absence of other phenotypic features. Mullerian agenesis would typically result in normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, including axillary hair, but with a blind vaginal pouch and absence of uterus - but wouldn't usually present with an inguinal mass. Gonadal dysgenesis might cause a lack of menstruation, but secondary sexual characteristics usually wouldn't develop normally.

Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), on the other hand, occurs in individuals who are genetically male (XY) but are resistant to male hormones (androgens). As a result, they have the physical traits of a woman but do not have a uterus or ovaries, which fits the scenario. They often present with a firm, nontender inguinal mass (undescended testes) and scant axillary and pubic hair, as described in the patient, due to the lack of androgen action.",Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,Y,"This patient has normal breast development and scant axillary hair, which indicate normal estrogen but reduced androgen effects. The blind vaginal pouch, absent uterus and ovaries, and the presence of a left inguinal mass suggest a disorder of sexual differentiation. The most likely diagnosis in this case is Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), previously known as testicular feminization. This is an X-linked disorder where individuals are genetically male (46, XY) but are resistant to androgens. They have testes that produce normal amounts of testosterone but the body is unable to respond to it, leading to a female phenotype with primary amenorrhea due to the lack of uterus and upper vagina.",Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,Y,"This patient's lack of menarche, normal breast development, scant axillary hair, and the presence of a firm, nontender left inguinal mass, alongside a blind vaginal pouch and the absence of uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography, are indicative of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS). AIS is a condition in which an individual who is genetically male (XY) is resistant to androgens (the hormones responsible for male sexual development). Therefore, they develop the physical characteristics of a female, despite having the genetic makeup of a male. Testes may be intra-abdominal or may descend to varying degrees, hence the left inguinal mass in this patient, which is most likely an undescended testis.",Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) in the general population is relatively low (1 in 20,000). However, given this patient's clinical findings, we can adjust this probability. The patient presents with primary amenorrhea and a blind vaginal pouch but with normal breast development. This clinical picture is strongly associated with AIS, increasing the posterior probability to around 60%. The presence of scant axillary hair further increases this probability, as AIS patients often have reduced body hair due to their inability to respond to androgens - this might bring the probability to about 80%. Finally, the discovery of an inguinal mass in a patient with AIS can be due to an undescended testis, which further increases the likelihood of AIS to around 90%. The absence of a uterus and ovaries on ultrasound further supports this diagnosis.",Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome,Y
"A 68-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of worsening fatigue and weight loss. He is especially concerned about a recent episode in which he noticed a blurring of his vision and headache; he also notes that his “memory is not as good as it used to be,” which his wife confirms. Physical exam is notable only for pallor and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal anemia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM; serum IgM concentration is 6.3 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?",Waldenstrom s macroglobulinemia,Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,Y,Multiple myeloma,N,Multiple myeloma,N,Multiple myeloma,N,Waldenström Macroglobulinemia,Y,,"This patient presents with fatigue, weight loss, neurological symptoms (like blurring of vision, headache, and memory issues), anemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The elevated ESR indicates an inflammatory process. Importantly, the lab tests reveal a monoclonal IgM spike on serum protein electrophoresis. These findings suggest a monoclonal gammopathy, which is a condition in which a person's body makes too many immunoglobulins, particularly a type known as IgM. The collection of these symptoms, along with the IgM spike, points towards a condition called Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. This is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that produces large amounts of IgM antibodies, which can cause the blood to become thick and can lead to the symptoms this patient is experiencing.",Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and some forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient's presentation includes fatigue, weight loss, blurring vision, and memory loss, which can be symptoms seen in multiple conditions, including malignancies. However, the laboratory findings give more specific clues. The patient has anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which can be seen in inflammatory and malignant conditions. The key finding here is the presence of monoclonal IgM spike on Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP). Monoclonal gammopathy points towards plasma cell or lymphoid neoplasms. In multiple myeloma, we typically see a monoclonal IgG or IgA spike. However, the presence of a monoclonal IgM spike is characteristic of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The symptoms of blurred vision and memory problems could be due to hyperviscosity syndrome, which is a common complication of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.",Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,Y,"This patient's fatigue, weight loss, pallor, and anemia are all symptoms of a chronic, systemic disease. More specifically, his elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) indicates an inflammatory state or malignancy. The presence of a monoclonal IgM spike on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) suggests a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Among these, the most common disease associated with an IgM spike is Waldenstr�m macroglobulinemia, which can cause hyperviscosity symptoms such as blurred vision and cognitive impairment due to high levels of the monoclonal protein in the blood. Thus, his presentation is most consistent with Waldenstr�m macroglobulinemia.",Waldenstr�m macroglobulinemia,Y,"This patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, blurring of vision, headache, memory issues, along with physical examination findings of pallor and weakness, are concerning for a hematologic disorder. The lab studies showing anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation or malignancy), further supports this. Most notably, the serum protein electrophoresis showing a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM is characteristic of a condition known as Waldenstr�m's macroglobulinemia (WM). WM is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in which the bone marrow produces too many abnormal white blood cells that crowd out healthy blood cells and produce a protein that impairs blood circulation. The vision problems and memory issues this patient is experiencing can be explained by hyperviscosity syndrome, a potential complication of WM, where increased blood viscosity due to high protein levels can lead to impaired circulation in the small vessels of the brain and eyes.",Waldenstr�m's macroglobulinemia,Y,"The prior probability of Waldenstr�m's Macroglobulinemia (WM) in an average person is low, but several pieces of information in this case increase the posterior probability. The symptoms described such as fatigue, weight loss, and especially vision blurring, headache and memory issues indicate possible hyperviscosity syndrome which is a hallmark of WM and increase the probability to 25%. The presence of pallor and general weakness further indicate anemia, which is commonly found in WM, thus the probability rises to 40%. The laboratory findings reveal anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which are common in WM and increase the posterior probability to 60%. Lastly, the presence of monoclonal IgM spike on SPEP and a high serum IgM concentration, which are characteristic of WM, increase the posterior probability to 90%.

"A 57-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department because of several episodes of hematemesis in the past 24 hours. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse of 95/min, and blood pressure of 85/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, he appears confused and unable to give a complete history. He is noted to have jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness consistent with the presence of ascites. Liver function tests are as follows:
Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  97 U/L
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 40 U/L
Serum albumin 2.5 g/dL
Total bilirubin 3 mg/dL
Prothrombin time 20 seconds
What is the most likely cause of this patient's illness?",Substance abuse,Cirrhosis,N,Cirrhosis.,N,Cirrhosis,N,Cirrhosis,N,Cirrhosis,N,,"This patient is presenting with signs of chronic liver disease indicated by jaundice, a firm liver (which indicates cirrhosis or fibrosis), splenomegaly, ascites, and abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST and ALT, low albumin, elevated bilirubin, and prolonged prothrombin time). His confusion could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a result of liver failure. Furthermore, the presence of hematemesis (vomiting of blood) could suggest a complication of liver disease such as esophageal varices, which can occur when there is increased pressure in the portal venous system (portal hypertension), typically a result of cirrhosis. Being homeless, he may also have a history of alcohol abuse, which is a common cause of liver disease and cirrhosis.",Alcoholic cirrhosis,Y,"This patient presents with a history of homelessness, hematemesis, hypotension, confusion, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, and coagulopathy. The differential diagnosis in this context could include hepatic cirrhosis (potentially secondary to alcohol abuse or viral hepatitis), acute hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, alcoholic hepatitis, or portal vein thrombosis. The physical examination and laboratory results - including jaundice, firm liver, splenomegaly, ascites, decreased albumin, increased total bilirubin, and increased prothrombin time - are suggestive of chronic liver disease. The mild elevation of AST and ALT could indicate ongoing liver damage, but the pattern does not suggest acute viral hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury, which usually result in much higher transaminase levels. A markedly elevated AST in relation to ALT could suggest alcoholic hepatitis, but this patient does not present the usual high ratio (>2:1). The fact that the patient is homeless raises the possibility of chronic alcohol abuse, but also of exposure to viral hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B or C. The presentation, however, is more consistent with cirrhosis, which results from chronic liver damage, than with acute disease. Cirrhosis could lead to all the observed clinical and laboratory findings through the development of portal hypertension (splenomegaly, ascites) and decreased liver function (jaundice, coagulopathy). Hence, the most likely diagnosis is cirrhosis of the liver.",Liver cirrhosis,N,"The patient's presentation suggests advanced liver disease. Jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness (indicating ascites) are all signs of cirrhosis. Additionally, his laboratory findings are consistent with significant hepatic dysfunction: elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), decreased serum albumin, elevated total bilirubin, and prolonged prothrombin time, which indicates impaired synthesis of clotting factors. This is most commonly due to chronic alcoholism in a homeless individual, and his current hematemesis could be a result of esophageal variceal bleeding, a common and life-threatening complication of cirrhosis.",Alcoholic cirrhosis,Y,"This patient's presentation suggests chronic liver disease, likely due to alcohol use given his homelessness and socioeconomic status, which is a risk factor for alcoholism. His jaundice, low albumin, elevated prothrombin time, and increased bilirubin suggest hepatocellular dysfunction and cholestasis. His splenomegaly and ascites suggest portal hypertension, which could be due to cirrhosis. The higher level of AST than ALT is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. Finally, his hematemesis could be due to a bleeding esophageal varix, which is a serious complication of portal hypertension from cirrhosis. Thus, the most likely cause of this patient's illness is alcoholic cirrhosis.",Alcoholic cirrhosis,Y,"This patient is exhibiting multiple signs of chronic liver disease including jaundice, a firm liver, splenomegaly, and ascites. In this context, the liver function tests demonstrate a modestly increased AST and ALT, decreased albumin, increased bilirubin, and increased prothrombin time - all compatible with significant liver dysfunction.

Starting with a prior probability that this homeless man's illness is due to alcohol-related liver disease at around 30% (given that alcohol misuse is prevalent in homeless populations), the posterior probability increases with each piece of evidence.

The signs of chronic liver disease (jaundice, firm liver, splenomegaly, ascites) increase the probability to around 50%.

The liver function tests showing liver dysfunction further increase the probability to about 70%. Specifically, a prothrombin time of 20 seconds is suggestive of impaired liver synthesis function, a hallmark of significant liver disease such as alcoholic cirrhosis.

Furthermore, the man's confusion could be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis, which increases the probability to 85%.

The episodes of hematemesis - vomiting blood - could be due to esophageal varices, another complication of liver cirrhosis due to portal hypertension. This increases the probability to over 95%.

Based on these considerations, the most likely cause of this patient's illness is alcohol-related liver disease, likely cirrhosis.",Alcoholic Cirrhosis,Y
"Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks’ gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?",Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins,Amniotic fluid embolism,Y,Amniotic fluid embolism.,Y,Amniotic fluid embolism,Y,Amniotic fluid embolism,Y,Amniotic fluid embolism.,Y,,"This 35-year-old woman is at full term pregnancy and has symptoms of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension shortly after combined spinal-epidural anesthesia and rupture of membranes. The sudden onset of symptoms including labored breathing, hypoxia, and hypotension indicate a severe systemic issue. Her presentation is suggestive of a sudden, significant hemorrhage as evidenced by the pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal, rapid pulse, low blood pressure, and a significantly reduced hemoglobin concentration.

Furthermore, her fibrinogen level is undetectable, indicating a severe disruption in her clotting system. In the context of pregnancy and recent rupture of membranes, the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism. This rare, catastrophic event occurs when there is an entry of amniotic fluid or other fetal material into the maternal circulation, leading to both a hemorrhagic (from disseminated intravascular coagulation leading to the low fibrinogen) and a cardiopulmonary crisis, which are the main causes of maternal mortality associated with this condition.",Amniotic fluid embolism,Y,"This patient presents with chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension, which can be seen in a variety of conditions. The differential diagnosis would include pulmonary embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, eclampsia, and hemorrhagic shock. The undetectable fibrinogen concentration, however, indicates a coagulopathy, and the rapid onset of her symptoms associated with the onset of labor and anesthesia suggests an event related to the pregnancy.

The presence of bright red blood in the cervical canal suggests active bleeding. Her symptoms of labored breathing and hypotension may be the result of blood loss and/or an embolic event. Amniotic fluid embolism can occur when amniotic fluid, fetal cells, hair, or other debris enter the mother's bloodstream, triggering an inflammatory response leading to respiratory distress, altered mental status, cardiovascular collapse, and coagulopathy.

Considering her obstetric history, the timing of her symptoms, and the presence of coagulopathy (i.e., undetectable fibrinogen concentration), the most likely diagnosis is amniotic fluid embolism. This is a rare but severe complication of pregnancy and childbirth.",Amniotic fluid embolism,Y,"This patient's rapid onset of symptoms including chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension after the rupture of her membranes and spinal-epidural anesthesia, along with physical examination findings of labored breathing, thready pulses, and crackles at both lung bases, suggests a severe, life-threatening condition. The pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal indicates abnormal bleeding, and the undetectable fibrinogen concentration in combination with a low hemoglobin is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). One condition that can cause DIC in this clinical setting is amniotic fluid embolism, which can occur during labor, delivery, or the immediate postpartum period, usually after rupture of membranes or other disruption of the maternal-fetal interface. It is associated with hypoxemia (as evidenced by the low oxygen saturation of 82% on room air), cardiovascular collapse (evidenced by tachycardia and hypotension), and coagulopathy, all of which are present in this patient.",Amniotic fluid embolism,Y,"This patient presents with signs of sudden onset shock (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, confusion) accompanied by bleeding as shown by pooling of blood in the cervical canal and a significant drop in hemoglobin. The sudden onset and the context of recent membrane rupture and labor strongly suggest Amniotic Fluid Embolism (AFE). AFE is a rare but life-threatening obstetric emergency, where amniotic fluid, fetal cells, or other debris enter the maternal circulation and cause cardiorespiratory collapse and coagulopathy. The coagulopathy in AFE is due to consumption of coagulation factors, which can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), explaining the undetectable fibrinogen in this patient (fibrinogen is a key clotting factor which is consumed during DIC).",Amniotic Fluid Embolism,Y,"This patient's symptoms indicate a serious and rapidly progressive condition. The prior probability of amniotic fluid embolism, a rare obstetric emergency, is less than 1% in the general population. However, this patient's sudden onset of respiratory distress, hypotension, and altered mental status immediately after rupture of membranes substantially raises this probability.

Let's analyze the symptoms:

The sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, and confusion increases the posterior probability of amniotic fluid embolism to about 20%. These symptoms can be associated with cardiovascular collapse and hypoxemic respiratory failure, which are typical in amniotic fluid embolism.

The fact that these symptoms occurred shortly after rupture of membranes further increases the likelihood of amniotic fluid embolism to 40%. Rupture of membranes is a known risk factor for amniotic fluid embolism.

The finding of hypotension and a rapid heart rate (tachycardia) are signs of cardiovascular collapse, which further increases the posterior probability of an amniotic fluid embolism to 60%.

The presence of pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal may indicate an issue with coagulation, and the undetectable fibrinogen concentration confirms a coagulopathy, which is often seen in the second phase of amniotic fluid embolism due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This increases the posterior probability of amniotic fluid embolism to around 80%.

In conclusion, this patient's signs and symptoms most likely indicate an amniotic fluid embolism.",Amniotic fluid embolism,Y

However, rapid onset within hours after eating as in this case, is most commonly associated with a type of food poisoning called staphylococcal food poisoning, caused by toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus.

He ate some food from the afternoon and an hour later, he began experiencing abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms are characteristic of food poisoning. In particular, the short incubation period suggests a preformed bacterial toxin, such as that from Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, which are often implicated in foodborne illnesses and can cause symptoms within a few hours of consumption. Appendicitis and cholecystitis are less likely given the lack of localized abdominal pain, and gastroenteritis generally has a longer incubation period. So, the patient most likely has food poisoning.",Food poisoning,Y,"This young patient has symptoms of acute gastroenteritis (abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) that occurred shortly after consuming food that had been left out for a period of time. These findings are consistent with foodborne illness.

Staphylococcus aureus, one of the common causes of food poisoning, produces enterotoxins that are heat-stable and can cause symptoms typically within 1-6 hours of consuming contaminated food. The fact that the patient heated the food for a while before eating, but still got sick, also suggests a toxin-mediated process, as toxins may not be eliminated by simple heating.

Histoplasmosis often presents as a pulmonary infection, especially in immunocompromised individuals or those with significant exposure, and can manifest with a non-productive cough, dyspnea, and granulomas or cavities on imaging, as seen in this patient.",Histoplasmosis,Y,"The prior probability of Histoplasmosis is 2%. Given that the patient has a cavitary lesion seen on imaging, this increases the posterior probability to 10%. The finding of necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages on biopsy is highly suggestive of Histoplasma infection and thus increases the probability to 60%. Considering the patient's recent visit to St. Louis, Missouri, an endemic area for Histoplasmosis, this increases the posterior probability to 80%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Histoplasmosis.",Histoplasmosis,Y
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling of her right hand. Two days ago, she was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken in the middle of the night by “something crawling on my hand.” The following morning, she saw a wound on her hand that was initially painless, but over the next several hours she noticed reddening and blistering. Yesterday, the lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand.

The following morning, she discovered a wound that over time progressed to redness, blistering, and eventually a bluish plaque with central necrosis, surrounded by erythema. These symptoms suggest a bite or sting from a venomous creature. Given the location and progression of symptoms, as well as the geographic location (Texas), the most likely culprit is a Brown Recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa), which are prevalent in the southern and central United States.

The symptoms described including pain, discoloration, swelling, and particularly a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema suggest a venomous creature has inflicted a bite or sting. Given that the patient was camping outdoors in Texas, possible culprits include venomous snakes, spiders, scorpions, or insects. The symptom of the lesion turning blue with a blackish discoloration at the center narrows the differential, as this is characteristic of a bite from a brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa). The brown recluse spider is native to several US states, including Texas, and is known for its necrotic venom which can lead to symptoms similar to those described by the patient.

The location of the incident in Texas, an area where venomous spiders such as the brown recluse are known to be present, raises the posterior probability to 60%. The presentation of the wound, described as a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema, corresponds strongly with the classic sign of a brown recluse spider bite, increasing the probability to 90%.

NMS is a life-threatening condition often caused by an adverse reaction to antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol, which was administered to the patient. The generalised muscle rigidity, often described as ""lead-pipe rigidity"", and the high fever are key clinical features. Furthermore, this syndrome is frequently associated with other autonomic symptoms, such as hypertension and tachycardia.

"A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow.

His examination and test findings, including a positive Homan's sign (pain upon dorsiflexion of the foot), and ultrasonography confirming the presence of a hyperechoic mass in the popliteal vein, strongly support this diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's risk factors, such as obesity, smoking, and a family history of pulmonary embolism, predispose him to DVT. The presence of positive fibrin split products indicates active blood clotting and degradation, which is seen in thrombotic conditions like DVT.

The history of his father having a pulmonary embolism might suggest a hereditary thrombophilia. Moreover, his smoking history and obesity are additional risk factors for thrombosis. The presence of positive fibrin split products (D-dimer) in his laboratory tests are consistent with active clot breakdown, further supporting the diagnosis of DVT.",Deep venous thrombosis,N,"The patient in question presents with severe lower leg pain, swelling, and a positive result on the Homan's sign (severe pain in the calf upon dorsiflexion of the foot), which are suggestive of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The presence of fibrin split products, which are seen in clot degradation, also support the diagnosis. This is further confirmed by ultrasonography of the left leg showing incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow, which are typical findings in DVT. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) being within normal range suggests there's no underlying clotting factor disorder or use of anticoagulants prior to admission.",Deep Vein Thrombosis,N,"The prior probability of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) in a young, otherwise healthy person is quite low, let's say around 1%. However, the fact that this patient's father has a history of pulmonary embolism, which could suggest a familial predisposition to clotting disorders, increases the posterior probability to around 5%. The patient's smoking habit, which is a known risk factor for DVT, further increases this probability to about 15%. His high BMI, another risk factor, takes the probability up to 30%.

His symptoms, including pain, swelling, and tenderness in the leg, further increase the likelihood to around 60%. The positive Homan's sign, which is the increase in pain with dorsiflexion of the foot, raises the likelihood to around 80%.

The history of continuous bloody diarrhea and the continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon as seen in colonoscopy are more suggestive of ulcerative colitis. Crohn's disease typically has a ""skip pattern"" of disease, which means there are healthy parts of the intestine mixed in with inflamed areas, unlike the continuous inflammation seen in ulcerative colitis. The history of weight loss might raise suspicion for colon cancer, but the presence of continuous inflammation and lack of mention of a distinct mass make this less likely.

The endoscopic finding of continuous lesions is highly suggestive of UC, as Crohn's disease, the other main type of inflammatory bowel disease, typically presents with skip lesions (areas of disease separated by healthy tissue).

The symptoms of bloody stool, frequent urge to defecate, and abdominal discomfort are characteristic features of ulcerative colitis. The disease often causes inflammation and ulcers in the innermost lining of the colon and rectum, which leads to symptoms like bloody diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. Colonoscopy findings showing continuous mucosal lesions from the rectum to the hepatic flexure further supports the diagnosis, as this pattern of disease (involving only the colon and rectum and in a continuous manner) is typical for ulcerative colitis, distinguishing it from Crohn's disease, another type of IBD that can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract and often shows a discontinuous pattern of disease. The weight loss can be attributed to the chronic inflammation and malabsorption associated with the disease. The history of bulimia with laxative abuse, although significant, does not explain his present symptoms and colonoscopy findings.",Ulcerative Colitis,Y,"The prior probability of ulcerative colitis in this case could be estimated at 1%. The presence of bloody stools, continuous mucosal lesions from the rectum to the hepatic flexure, and weight loss are consistent with ulcerative colitis, increasing the probability to about 20%.

Many drugs can cause this condition, but in the context of testicular cancer, it's most likely to be due to bleomycin, which is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of this disease. Furthermore, the pulmonary function tests showing a decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC) with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio support a restrictive pattern, which is also suggestive of interstitial lung disease.",Bleomycin,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, and drug-induced pulmonary toxicity.

Given the history and the timeline, this is most likely caused by drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis. This condition often happens as a reaction to certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics, both of which the patient is receiving (ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam). NSAIDs like ketoprofen are known to decrease renal blood flow and can cause kidney injury, especially in individuals with pre-existing renal impairment or those who are at risk, such as this elderly patient with hypertension and diabetes. Piperacillin and tazobactam are antibiotics, and antibiotics are a common cause of acute interstitial nephritis.",Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) could include pre-renal causes like volume depletion, renal causes like acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or interstitial nephritis, and post-renal causes like obstruction. Volume depletion could be secondary to poor oral intake or excessive loss from gastrointestinal sources, but there's no mention of diarrhea, vomiting, or dehydration signs. Renal obstruction could result from nephrolithiasis or malignancy, but the patient's symptoms and findings don't suggest this. This patient was given NSAIDs (ketoprofen) and antibiotics (piperacillin and tazobactam), both of which could potentially cause interstitial nephritis. However, he also has risk factors for ATN such as age, diabetes, hypertension, and the recent use of NSAIDs, which can reduce renal blood flow. Given the relatively rapid decline in kidney function (within days), and the presence of proteinuria, ATN induced by NSAIDs (ketoprofen) is the most likely diagnosis. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin production, which in turn reduces glomerular filtration rate (GFR), leading to AKI.",NSAID-induced Acute Tubular Necrosis,N,"This patient's decreased urine output and elevated creatinine level suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). There are three primary causes of AKI: prerenal, renal (intrinsic), and postrenal. The absence of any obstruction (postrenal cause) on the CT scan and the presence of proteinuria (which is not usually seen in prerenal AKI) would point towards an intrinsic renal cause. Among intrinsic causes, Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) should be considered given this patient's recent initiation of piperacillin-tazobactam. AIN is a common cause of drug-induced AKI and beta-lactam antibiotics, like piperacillin-tazobactam, are frequently implicated. AIN typically presents with nonspecific symptoms, like mild fever or rash, but it can also be asymptomatic. However, the key diagnostic feature is the temporal association with drug initiation.",Acute Interstitial Nephritis,N,"This patient had normal renal function on admission with a creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, but he has since developed acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL. Given his recent start of therapy with ketoprofen, a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), we must consider the possibility of drug-induced AKI. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandins which are responsible for dilating the afferent arterioles of the glomerulus. By constricting these arterioles, NSAIDs can reduce renal perfusion and cause acute kidney injury, especially in a setting where the patient's systemic circulation may already be compromised, such as in an elderly patient with multiple comorbidities, like the one described here. Proteinuria also hints at an intrinsic renal cause. Thus, it is likely that his kidney injury is due to the ketoprofen.",Ketoprofen-induced acute kidney injury,N,"The prior probability of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) caused by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in this case can be assumed to be 5%.

The patient also has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, two conditions that make him more susceptible to NSAID-induced kidney damage, pushing the probability further to 50%. Furthermore, the temporal association between the administration of the NSAID and the development of renal symptoms (reduced urine output and increased serum creatinine) in a relatively short period supports the likelihood of NSAID-induced AKI, increasing the posterior probability to 75%.

"A patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her head. She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms.

The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. What is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?",Medication reaction,Stroke,N,Serotonin syndrome,N,Stroke,N,Stroke,N,Stroke,N,,"The patient presented to the emergency department with a severe headache that wasn't relieved by her usual headache medication, sumatriptan, which is typically used to treat migraines. She then received dihydroergotamine, another potent medication for severe migraines, and 100% oxygen, which is also a treatment strategy for severe migraines and cluster headaches. However, her condition worsened with the development of slurred speech, drooping of the left side of her mouth, and reduced strength in her left upper extremity. These symptoms suggest a neurological disorder and are indicative of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), also known as a stroke. The sudden onset of her symptoms and the presence of focal neurologic deficits are classic of an ischemic stroke, which can be confirmed by the head CT that has been ordered. Sumatriptan and dihydroergotamine belong to a class of medications known as triptans and ergotamines, which are associated with an increased risk of ischemic events, particularly in patients with other risk factors.",Ischemic stroke,,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include a migraine, drug reaction, psychological illness, cluster headache, and a cerebrovascular accident. Given the sudden onset of her symptoms, a severe headache not responding to medication, along with recent hospital admissions for mental health issues, the first thought could be a severe migraine or drug reaction, but these wouldn't typically cause one-sided weakness or slurred speech.

The use of dihydroergotamine is common in treating severe migraines; however, this drug is contraindicated in individuals with a risk of vascular disease as it may cause vasoconstriction and can provoke ischemic events. The presentation of a sudden severe headache, followed by slurred speech, facial droop, and weakness on one side, particularly in the context of receiving dihydroergotamine, is highly suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident, or stroke. The patient's symptoms and the timing, in this case, fit with the onset and progression of a stroke.

In conclusion, while migraines, drug reactions, and mental health issues should be considered, the combination of severe headache, left-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and unilateral weakness after administration of dihydroergotamine is most suggestive of a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).",Cerebrovascular Accident (Stroke),N,"This patient presents with severe headache that was not responsive to her usual medication, sumatriptan. She was given dihydroergotamine, a potent vasoconstrictor, to treat the presumed severe migraine. Afterward, she developed neurological signs consistent with a stroke: slurred speech, facial drooping, and arm weakness. Dihydroergotamine, especially when used in conjunction with sumatriptan, can cause significant vasoconstriction, leading to an ischemic stroke if the blood supply to a part of the brain is significantly reduced. This patient likely had an ischemic stroke due to medication-induced vasoconstriction.",Medication-induced ischemic stroke,Y,"This patient's presentation is consistent with an ischemic stroke. This could be due to several factors, including possible serotonin syndrome from the combination of sumatriptan (a triptan medication which is a serotonin agonist) and other possible serotonergic medications she may be on for her psychiatric conditions. Serotonin syndrome can result in significant arterial vasoconstriction, which could precipitate an ischemic event in a predisposed individual. The administration of dihydroergotamine, a powerful vasoconstrictor, could have also contributed to the stroke. It is also possible that her recent stress and panic attacks could have contributed to a hypercoagulable state. The CT scan would help confirm the diagnosis, but her sudden onset of focal neurologic symptoms such as slurred speech, facial drooping, and weakness on one side of her body are classic signs of an ischemic stroke.",Ischemic stroke,N,"The prior probability of a stroke in a relatively young woman without a stated history of risk factors (such as hypertension, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia) would typically be quite low, less than 1%. However, her current symptoms are indicative of a stroke, such as sudden onset of headache, slurred speech, facial droop, and decreased strength on one side. These symptoms significantly increase the posterior probability of a stroke.

The administration of dihydroergotamine can increase the risk of a stroke. Dihydroergotamine is a vasoconstrictor, used in the treatment of migraines. This can lead to ischemia, particularly in patients who are susceptible to cerebrovascular events. In this case, the use of dihydroergotamine in the context of a severe headache resistant to normal treatment may increase the probability of stroke to around 20%.

Sumatriptan, another medication the patient is using, is a selective serotonin receptor agonist that causes vasoconstriction of the cranial blood vessels, which helps in reducing the headache of a migraine. However, in susceptible individuals, it can increase the risk of a stroke, which may further increase the probability to around 35%.

The fact that the patient's symptoms have not improved but rather worsened with the treatment further increases the likelihood of stroke. This could increase the probability to around 70%.

Finally, the fact that the patient has been admitted to the hospital several times recently for panic attacks and suicide attempts suggests a high level of stress, which can be a contributing factor for a stroke. This, in combination with her clinical presentation, leads to the final probability of a stroke being over 90%.

This patient most likely has had a stroke.",Stroke,N

Let's consider the prior probabilities for different disorders:

The prior probability of Schizophrenia in the general population is roughly 1%.
The patient's social withdrawal and increasing isolation increase the posterior probability of Schizophrenia to approximately 10%.
The presence of paranoia (fear of aliens watching him and stealing his thoughts), a common symptom in schizophrenia, increases the posterior probability to around 30%.
The disorganized speech, which is impossible to follow, also indicative of schizophrenia, brings the posterior probability to about 50%.
The presence of flat affect, another symptom of schizophrenia, increases the posterior probability further to around 70%.
The age of the patient aligns with the typical age of onset for schizophrenia, which further strengthens our hypothesis.
These symptoms are in line with the DSM-5 criteria for schizophrenia, which requires at least two of the following symptoms present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms.",Schizophrenia,Y

Given the severity and duration of his symptoms, along with their onset shortly after birth, a primary immune deficiency disorder is a likely diagnosis. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is a disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, including skin and respiratory infections. It also often presents with poor growth and development. The chronic inflammation in CGD can lead to granuloma formation, which could explain the skin lesions seen in this patient.",Chronic Granulomatous Disease,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this young boy with recurrent skin infections, fever, lymphadenopathy, and failure to thrive include: severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, Ataxia Telangiectasia, Hyper IgM Syndrome, and Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD).

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome typically presents with thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts), eczema, and recurrent infections, however the skin manifestation doesn't match the description. Ataxia Telangiectasia usually presents with progressive neurologic impairment and ocular telangiectasia, which isn't mentioned here. Hyper IgM Syndrome is characterized by severe and recurrent infections, but often involves more systemic manifestations. Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is characterized by recurrent skin and lung infections due to the immune system's inability to form superoxide radicals needed to kill certain types of bacteria and fungi.

These symptoms, along with the fact that he is below average in length and weight, suggest an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. His early onset and failure to thrive raise the suspicion for Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID). This disease is characterized by a profound deficiency in both T-lymphocyte and B-lymphocyte function.

His low weight and length percentiles suggest a chronic disease that affects overall growth and development. The recurrent, purulent skin lesions and infections hint at a condition that prevents effective microbial clearance. One such condition is chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), which is a rare inherited primary immunodeficiency disorder that impairs the ability of neutrophils to kill certain bacteria and fungi. This leads to the formation of granulomas (collections of immune cells) in various tissues, causing the symptoms observed in this patient. CGD most commonly presents in childhood with recurrent or persistent infections with specific bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) and fungi, poor growth, and failure to thrive.",Chronic granulomatous disease,Y,"This patient presents with recurrent skin lesions, recurrent fevers, and respiratory tract infections since birth. These recurrent infections hint towards an immunodeficiency condition. This becomes our prior probability. Further, he is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. Failure to thrive is common in children with severe immune dysfunctions, such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Considering SCID as our new hypothesis, the likelihood of recurrent skin and respiratory infections, lymphadenopathy, and failure to thrive increases the posterior probability of SCID. Furthermore, given the age at which his symptoms started (2 months), it also supports the likelihood of SCID, since symptoms often present shortly after birth when the infant loses maternal antibody protection.

Her history of high fever and rash with bright red discoloration over her cheeks one month ago can indicate a recent infection. These findings suggest a condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which often follows an infection, especially with certain strains of E. coli (though other bacteria and viruses can also lead to HUS). HUS is characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.",Hemolytic uremic syndrome,Y,"The differential for this patient includes a variety of conditions such as viral illness, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), aplastic anemia, leukemia, and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The presence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction are characteristic of HUS. The history of diarrhea followed by pallor, petechiae, and renal impairment makes HUS the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear, which are fragmented red blood cells, is indicative of a microangiopathic hemolytic process, typical in HUS. HUS often follows an episode of infectious gastroenteritis, particularly those caused by E.coli (especially E. coli O157:H7), which produce Shiga toxin. This Shiga toxin can lead to damage to the endothelial cells in the small blood vessels of the kidneys and sometimes the CNS, resulting in the clinical syndrome seen here.

The previous episode of fever and rash could indicate a prior infection, such as with Streptococcus or a gastroenteritis-like illness, which could have been caused by a Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC). In HUS, the toxins produced during such infections lead to endothelial damage, which causes microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (evidenced by schistocytes on peripheral blood smear and low hemoglobin), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and acute kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine, presence of blood and protein in the urine).

The presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on peripheral blood smear is characteristic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, a type of anemia that occurs when red blood cells are sheared as they pass through small, damaged blood vessels. This constellation of findings suggests hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS often follows a diarrheal illness, which this patient had, caused by bacteria such as E.coli that produce Shiga toxin. Furthermore, her earlier episode of fever and rash could suggest a recent infectious etiology, and her current signs of pallor, irritability, and rash (petechiae) are consistent with the disease's symptomatology.",Hemolytic uremic syndrome,Y,"This patient's history and presentation suggest a disorder of the hematological and renal systems, in particular, Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).

Let's perform a Bayesian analysis:

The prior probability of HUS in a previously healthy child with sudden onset of pallor, rash, and recent history of diarrheal illness is quite high. Although exact probabilities are hard to establish in real-world medicine, it's not unreasonable to estimate this initial probability at around 40%.

The presence of petechiae and a low platelet count in this patient (49,000/mm3 when the normal range is 150,000-450,000/mm3) is consistent with thrombocytopenia, which is a key characteristic of HUS. This increases our posterior probability to 60%.

The hemoglobin value of 8 g/dL is lower than the normal range (for a 4-year-old, this should be around 11.5 to 15.5 g/dL), indicating anemia. The presence of schistocytes (fragmented red blood cells) on the blood smear is a strong indicator of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, another feature of HUS. These findings together increase the posterior probability to 75%.

Finally, the presence of elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicates renal impairment, again consistent with HUS, which often presents with signs of acute kidney injury. The urine results also show hematuria (blood 2+) and proteinuria (protein 2+), further confirming kidney involvement. These findings push our final posterior probability above 85%.

Therefore, the combination of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute kidney injury in this clinical context strongly suggests Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome as the most likely underlying cause of these findings.",Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome,Y

This hemolysis can cause fatigue (due to anemia) and dark urine (due to the presence of hemoglobin or bilirubin).",G6PD deficiency,Y,"The differential for this patient includes hemolytic anemia, drug-induced hemolysis, liver disease, kidney disease, and food poisoning. The patient's history of similar episodes since birth, recent dark urine, and fatigue are suggestive of some form of hemolytic process. Given that he's recently started on glipizide, drug-induced hemolysis could be a possibility; however, the lifelong pattern of similar episodes argues against this. Liver or kidney disease could also lead to dark urine and fatigue, but the episodic nature of his symptoms is less characteristic of these chronic diseases. Food poisoning could cause these symptoms as well, but it's less likely given the duration of symptoms and lack of other gastrointestinal manifestations. Hemolytic anemia, particularly a form that can cause episodic hemolysis like G6PD deficiency, aligns best with his symptoms.

This is a genetic condition more prevalent in people of African and Mediterranean descent and can lead to episodes of hemolytic anemia when individuals are exposed to oxidative stress. The stress can be triggered by various factors including certain foods, infections, and medications like sulfonylureas. Hemolysis releases hemoglobin into the blood, which is then converted to bilirubin, causing the dark urine.",Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Y,"This patient has a history of recurring fatigue and dark urine since birth. Dark urine is often a sign of hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) that leads to the release of hemoglobin into the bloodstream, which is then converted into bilirubin and excreted in urine, making it dark. These episodes seem to be episodic and self-resolving, suggesting a condition like glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which is a genetic disorder more common in people of African descent. G6PD is an enzyme that protects red blood cells from oxidative stress. Certain triggers, such as specific medications, infections, or foods (like fava beans in Mediterranean cuisine) can cause oxidative stress and precipitate a hemolytic episode in these individuals. In this case, the recent start of glipizide, a sulfonylurea used to treat type II diabetes, could have triggered a hemolytic episode, as sulfonylureas are known triggers for hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency.",G6PD deficiency-induced hemolysis,Y,"The prior probability of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in African-American males is about 10%. However, given that the patient has recurrent episodes of fatigue and dark urine since birth which resolved spontaneously, the likelihood of G6PD deficiency increases to 30%. The fact that the symptoms started after the introduction of glipizide (a sulfonylurea) � a known trigger for hemolytic crisis in people with G6PD deficiency � increases the probability to about 60%. His recent dietary change, although significant, does not further inform the Bayesian analysis since it is not directly linked to a typical precipitating event for a G6PD crisis. Thus, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a G6PD deficiency crisis triggered by glipizide.",G6PD deficiency crisis,Y

His regular intake of one pint of rum daily points towards alcoholism, which can cause cerebellar degeneration leading to a wide-based gait, difficulty with rapid alternating movements, and a coarse tremor.

While the patient's work in a factory that produces industrial solvents could lead to toxic exposure, the long-term heavy alcohol use and the specific symptoms presented (including impaired balance and coordination, tremor, and normal mental status) are more consistent with alcohol-related cerebellar degeneration.

His normal mental status and sensation bilaterally rules out conditions like multiple sclerosis and normal pressure hydrocephalus which often present with cognitive deficits.

The patient's age (above 40) and sedentary lifestyle further increase the probability to around 30-40%. The clinical presentation with stiffness and decreased active and passive range of motion, which are characteristic of adhesive capsulitis, increases the probability to around 60-80%. The fact that the patient's strength is 4/5 may make other muscular or neurological conditions less likely, thus maintaining a high probability for adhesive capsulitis.",Adhesive capsulitis,Y
"A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a “nagging” headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient’s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently asymptomatic while sitting in the office, and physical examination is unremarkable. Labs are drawn, as shown below:

Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL
Hematocrit: 60%
Leukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 350,000/mm^3

What underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",Toxic exposure,Acute mountain sickness,N,Altitude sickness,N,Carbon monoxide poisoning.,Y,Anemia,N,Altitude sickness,N,,"This patient presents with a headache and dizziness persisting for a month, symptoms which can be indicative of a number of conditions. However, his relief from symptoms when going outside to shovel snow gives us a hint that the symptoms may be related to a change in oxygenation. The other significant aspect is that he has been living in his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks. This could indicate that he is at a high altitude, which would result in hypoxia, or low oxygen levels. Chronic hypoxia can lead to secondary polycythemia, a condition where the body increases the production of red blood cells in response to prolonged low oxygen levels. This is supported by his lab results which show a high hemoglobin level (20 g/dL) and hematocrit (60%), both markers of red blood cell volume.",Chronic Hypoxia-Induced Secondary Polycythemia,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's symptoms - headache, dizziness, and nausea - could include many conditions, such as high blood pressure, a neurological issue, anemia, hypoxia, dehydration, or a drug reaction. However, we also know from his history that he's been spending time in an upstate cabin, a possible high-altitude area, for the past 5 weeks. These symptoms could represent altitude sickness.

The patient's lab findings reveal an elevated hemoglobin level and hematocrit, indicating polycythemia, which is the body's response to chronic hypoxia. This can occur with lung diseases, but the patient's oxygen saturation is normal and he has no respiratory symptoms, making lung disease less likely.

Another cause of polycythemia is high altitude. The lower oxygen concentration at high altitudes can lead to chronic hypoxia, which the body compensates for by producing more red blood cells, leading to polycythemia. This condition can cause symptoms like the ones the patient is experiencing. The temporary relief he experiences when he shovels snow might be due to increased oxygen inhalation during this exercise.

Although secondary causes like hypoxia due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or sleep apnea, and kidney disease should be ruled out, the history of living in an upstate cabin and absence of other suggestive symptoms makes them less likely.

Based on his living situation, the chronic nature of his symptoms, and the laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is polycythemia due to high altitude living.",High altitude polycythemia,N,"The patient's symptoms, which include headaches, dizziness, and nausea, which improve with exposure to the outside air, are suggestive of hyperviscosity syndrome, a condition associated with increased blood viscosity. His labs show an increased hemoglobin level of 20 g/dL and a hematocrit of 60%, which is above the normal range and can cause an increase in blood viscosity. In addition, the patient is living in an upstate cabin which is likely at high altitude where the oxygen levels are lower. The body often compensates for lower oxygen availability at high altitudes by increasing red blood cell production to improve oxygen-carrying capacity. This can result in secondary polycythemia, which can manifest with the symptoms described due to increased blood viscosity and poor oxygen delivery. Therefore, the most likely underlying condition for the patient's diagnosis is his exposure to high altitude.",High altitude exposure,N,"The symptoms of headache, dizziness, and nausea in this patient, who is currently living in an upstate cabin, are suggestive of hypoxic conditions, potentially due to living at a higher altitude. These symptoms, along with his laboratory results showing an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggest that he might have secondary polycythemia. Secondary polycythemia is a condition where the body increases red blood cell production in response to chronic low oxygen levels (hypoxia), such as that found at high altitudes. This response is a compensatory mechanism aiming to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood in the face of reduced oxygen availability. As the patient reports feeling better when he's outside, it's also possible his cabin has poor ventilation, which could be exacerbating the hypoxic condition. Lastly, it's important to note that while the patient does have other conditions like hypertension and type II diabetes, none of his current medications would likely induce polycythemia.",Secondary Polycythemia,N,"The initial probability of polycythemia vera, a disease characterized by an increased number of erythrocytes, is low, let's say 1%. However, the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit values are significantly elevated which is a classic sign of polycythemia, this increases the posterior probability of polycythemia vera to 30%. He also presents with a headache and dizziness, common symptoms of polycythemia vera, which further increases the probability to 50%. He also experiences symptomatic relief in cold environments (i.e., shoveling snow) which can be explained by vasoconstriction reducing blood flow and consequently reducing the manifestations of hyperviscosity seen in polycythemia, this increases the probability to 70%. Lastly, he has no travel history, smoking, or other lung disease to suggest secondary polycythemia due to chronic hypoxia. This lack of secondary causes increases the probability of polycythemia vera to 90%. Therefore, the patient most likely has polycythemia vera.",Polycythemia Vera,N
"A 67-year-old male comes into the ED complaining of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest. He reports that over the past month he has become more easily “winded"" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can’t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:

Volume: 30 cc of fluid
Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL
Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L

What conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?",Lymphoma,Malignant pleural effusion,Y,Infection or malignancy,Y,Malignancy,Y,Infection or malignancy,Y,"Malignancy, infection, CHF",N,,"This patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and the inability to ascend the stairs without feeling ""winded"" are suggestive of a significant underlying pathology. The physical exam findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right side, along with the chest radiograph demonstrating a right-sided pleural effusion, confirm the presence of an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space.

The analysis of the pleural fluid can help differentiate between a transudative and an exudative effusion, which can be useful for determining the cause. The Light's criteria is commonly used, which states that an effusion is exudative if any of the following are true:

Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5
Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6
Pleural fluid LDH more than 2/3 the upper limit of normal serum LDH
Given the provided pleural fluid protein level and the serum protein ratio, it's evident that the fluid is exudative in nature as the pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio is > 0.5 (5.8/7.0 = 0.83).

Exudative effusions are generally caused by conditions like infections (pneumonia, tuberculosis), malignancies (lung cancer, mesothelioma), autoimmune conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus), and pulmonary embolism. Given the patient's age and the insidious onset of symptoms, malignancy is a potential cause that needs to be considered.","Malignancy, Infection, Autoimmune disease, Pulmonary embolism",Y,"In order to determine the underlying conditions that might have led to this patient's pleural effusion, we need to classify the fluid as either a transudate or an exudate. This classification helps narrow the differential diagnosis.

The criteria often used to differentiate between transudates and exudates is Light's criteria, which considers the effusion an exudate if any of the following conditions are met:

Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio > 0.5
Pleural fluid LDH/serum LDH ratio > 0.6
Pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 the upper limit of normal serum LDH
In this case, we don't have all the serum values to apply Light's criteria fully, but the pleural fluid protein is considerably high (5.8 g/dL) suggesting an exudative effusion.

Causes of exudative pleural effusions include conditions such as pneumonia, malignancies, tuberculosis, pulmonary embolism, and autoimmune diseases. In the context of this patient, given his age, chronic symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and the right-sided pleural effusion, one might be concerned about malignancies (lung or pleural), chronic infections such as tuberculosis, or other less common conditions.

However, without further diagnostic studies or more clinical information, it's difficult to definitively narrow down the possibilities.","Malignancy, Tuberculosis",Y,"The patient's symptoms such as dyspnea, heaviness in the chest, decreased breath sounds on the right side, dullness on percussion, and evidence of a right-sided pleural effusion on radiographic imaging, point to an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. The results of the thoracocentesis and pleural fluid analysis can help distinguish between transudative (i.e., due to systemic factors like heart failure) and exudative (i.e., due to local lung or pleural disease) pleural effusions.

The pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio is greater than 0.5 and the LDH level is likely elevated (though we don't have the serum LDH for comparison, typically the upper limit for pleural fluid LDH is around 200 U/L), suggesting an exudative effusion. This could be due to a number of conditions such as malignancy, pneumonia, tuberculosis, or pulmonary embolism.

Given the information provided, we can't definitively determine the underlying condition that led to the pleural effusion. Further diagnostic tests (e.g., cytology, culture, biopsy) would be necessary to pinpoint the cause. However, considering the patient's age and the chronicity and severity of his symptoms, malignancy (lung cancer or metastatic disease) is a plausible possibility that should be further investigated.","Possible malignancy, pneumonia, tuberculosis, or pulmonary embolism",Y,"The protein ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein (pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels can be helpful in distinguishing between an exudative and a transudative pleural effusion. If the ratio of pleural fluid protein/serum protein is greater than 0.5, or if the pleural fluid LDH is greater than two-thirds the upper limit of normal for serum LDH, it suggests an exudative effusion. Here, the pleural fluid protein is high, indicating an exudative effusion. Exudative pleural effusions are caused by conditions that create inflammation or blockages in the lymphatic system that normally drains fluid from around the lungs. This includes a wide range of conditions such as malignancies, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and autoimmune diseases, among others. Given the patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and headaches, it's possible that he could have one of these conditions causing an exudative pleural effusion.","Malignancy, Pneumonia, Pulmonary Embolism, Autoimmune Diseases",Y,"When we are presented with a pleural effusion, we can differentiate between transudative and exudative effusions using Light's Criteria. According to Light's Criteria, an effusion is likely exudative if one or more of the following are present:

Pleural fluid protein/serum protein ratio >0.5.
Pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/serum LDH ratio >0.6.
Pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds the upper limit of normal serum LDH.
In this patient's case, given the high protein ratio (pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL, serum protein: 7.0 g/dL), which is more than 0.5, we can deduce that the effusion is likely exudative.

Now, the next step is to figure out what conditions may have led to an exudative pleural effusion. Exudative effusions occur due to increased capillary permeability or decreased lymphatic absorption. The common causes are pneumonia, malignancy, pulmonary embolism, tuberculosis, and autoimmune diseases.

Given the patient's age, the chronic onset of symptoms, and the absence of other specific clinical indications such as fever, weight loss, or joint pains, we can use Bayesian reasoning to suggest malignancy and heart failure as the most likely causes. While heart failure typically leads to bilateral effusions and more commonly transudates, it's not impossible to see an exudate or unilateral effusion. Malignancy, particularly lung or pleural mesothelioma, should also be a consideration given the chronic nature of the symptoms and the patient's age.","Malignancy, Heart Failure",N
"A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 15 g/dL

Given his age and the fact that this was found on routine screening (without symptoms of infection, bleeding, or anemia), the most likely diagnosis would be Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL often presents asymptomatically and is found on routine lab work. Moreover, the family history of hematologic malignancy may suggest a genetic predisposition for these types of disorders.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y,"The differential diagnoses in a case like this include leukemias, lymphomas, myeloproliferative disorders, infections, and an immune response to an inflammatory condition. The patient does not present with fever, weight loss, night sweats, or any other symptom of infection or systemic illness. The high leukocyte count is primarily due to lymphocytosis as evidenced by flow cytometry. The lymphocytosis without the presence of systemic symptoms or infection points towards a chronic lymphocytic condition. The chronic lymphoproliferative disorder in adults that presents with lymphocytosis without any other symptoms is typically Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Furthermore, CLL has a hereditary component, and the patient's brother died from a hematologic malignancy, which might support this diagnosis.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y,"This patient's lab findings of an elevated leukocyte count with lymphocytosis on flow cytometry are consistent with a lymphoproliferative disorder. The relatively asymptomatic presentation and absence of significant lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or other systemic symptoms are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a common leukemia in adults over 60 years old. Additionally, this patient has a family history of hematologic malignancy, which could further support the diagnosis.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y,"The laboratory test results show a leukocyte count of 58,000/mm3, which is significantly higher than the normal range (4,500 to 11,000 per microliter). Flow cytometry also reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3, indicating a substantial increase in the lymphocyte population. Given this patient's age and these findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow that most often affects people over the age of 50. CLL primarily affects the B cell lymphocytes and typically progresses slowly, which may explain the absence of other symptoms in this patient.",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Y,"The initial (prior) probability of any form of leukemia in an asymptomatic 75-year-old man is quite low. However, his brother's history of hematologic malignancy marginally increases the risk. Still, it's not until the patient's leukocyte count, which is elevated at 58,000/mm3, that the probability of a hematologic malignancy significantly increases. An increased white blood cell count is a common finding in various types of leukemia.

Further, flow cytometry revealing an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3 substantially increases the likelihood of a specific type of leukemia - Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL is characterized by an elevated lymphocyte count and is more common in older adults, usually presenting with no symptoms or minimal lymphadenopathy. Hence, the posterior probability of CLL in this patient based on the given data is relatively high, making it the most likely diagnosis.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y

However, the marked tenderness, progressive pain, high leukocyte count, increased ESR, lytic lesions on X-ray, and the finding of ""small round blue cells"" on biopsy, all point towards a malignancy. Among these features, small round blue cells are indicative of Ewing sarcoma, which is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, often causing progressively worsening pain. The trauma event mentioned could be misleading as trauma is not a predisposing factor for Ewing sarcoma, but it often brings the underlying disease to clinical attention.",Ewing sarcoma,Y,"The patient has been experiencing progressive leg pain for two months, worsening to the point of disturbing his sleep. He has a significant elevation in his leukocyte count, which can indicate an infection or malignancy. His ESR, or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is also elevated which is a non-specific marker of inflammation. The X-ray findings show lytic bone lesions (areas where normal bone tissue has been destroyed) and a 'layered' appearance of new bone formation around the cortex. The new bone formation could represent periosteal reaction, which is a response to irritation, damage, or malignancy. Additionally, a biopsy of the femur reveals small round blue cells.

Additionally, the patient also has leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, indicating a possible pancytopenia. His neurologic symptoms, like ataxia and behavioral changes, in conjunction with these blood findings, are highly suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency. It's important to note that he is a vegetarian and may not be getting enough vitamin B12 in his diet, as this vitamin is predominantly found in animal products. The absence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies rules out pernicious anemia, a common cause of B12 deficiency, but does not rule out deficiency due to dietary insufficiency or malabsorption.",Vitamin B12 deficiency,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes various conditions like vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, copper deficiency, neurodegenerative disorders, and psychiatric conditions. His symptoms including generalized weakness, repeated falls, ataxic gait, and behavioral changes suggest a neurologic disorder, possibly related to a nutritional deficiency given his vegetarian diet and significant weight loss. His lab findings with megaloblastic anemia (high MCV and low Hb), pancytopenia (low platelet and total count), and hypersegmented neutrophils also point to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is common in vegetarians due to its primary source being animal products. While both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies can cause megaloblastic anemia, the neurological symptoms are more suggestive of vitamin B12 deficiency, as folate deficiency does not typically lead to neurologic abnormalities. Moreover, his anti-intrinsic factor antibodies test is negative, which rules out pernicious anemia, a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency.

However, this patient's wide-based ataxic gait, paranoia, and irritability can also suggest a copper deficiency. Copper deficiency can lead to myelopathy presenting as a spastic gait, sensory ataxia, and pancytopenia - all seen in this patient.

Between these two possibilities, copper deficiency is relatively rare and is most often seen in patients who have had gastric surgery or excess zinc intake. As there is no mention of these in the patient history, it makes vitamin B12 deficiency more likely, despite the negative intrinsic factor antibody test (vitamin B12 deficiency can be caused by factors other than pernicious anemia, such as malabsorption or dietary deficiency).",Vitamin B12 deficiency,Y,"This patient presents with fatigue, generalized weakness, significant weight loss, and behavioral changes (irritability, paranoia, and delusions), along with ataxia (as demonstrated by an unstable, wide-based gait). These symptoms could be indicative of neurological and psychiatric manifestations. The laboratory results reveal macrocytic anemia (Hb 6.1 g/dL, MCV 109 fL), thrombocytopenia (platelets 90,000/mm3), and leukopenia (total count 3,000/mm3) along with a low reticulocyte count, suggestive of inadequate bone marrow response. The peripheral blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils, another clue toward a macrocytic anemia, typically seen in vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. The negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies result makes pernicious anemia less likely as the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Given that this patient is a vegetarian, he may have dietary insufficiency of vitamin B12, which is mostly found in animal products. This deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia and neurological manifestations due to impaired synthesis of myelin.

So, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is dietary vitamin B12 deficiency.",Dietary Vitamin B12 Deficiency,Y,"This patient has numerous findings indicative of B12 deficiency, which is rare in vegetarians but can occur in those following a strict vegan diet or if there's an issue with absorption. The significant weight loss and behavioral changes (irritability, paranoia, delusion) suggest a neuropsychiatric manifestation of B12 deficiency. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait can also be a sign of neurological involvement. Laboratory findings consistent with B12 deficiency include a low hemoglobin level and an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV), indicative of macrocytic anemia. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear further supports the diagnosis. The low reticulocyte count suggests that this anemia is likely due to a production problem, which is consistent with B12 deficiency. Although the patient tested negative for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, not all patients with B12 deficiency due to pernicious anemia (the most common cause of B12 deficiency in non-vegetarians) will have this antibody.",Vitamin B12 deficiency,Y,"We are given an elderly patient presenting with numerous symptoms including repeated falls, dizziness, fatigue, weight loss, behavioral changes, and a notably low blood count and MCV values, amongst other things. All these suggest some form of anemia, particularly a form of macrocytic anemia due to the high MCV (mean corpuscular volume) value. This can be associated with vitamin B12 or folate deficiencies.

The prior probability of vitamin B12 deficiency in vegetarians could be quite high, let's say 25% given that major sources of vitamin B12 are animal-derived foods. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and behavioral changes are common in vitamin B12 deficiency, increasing the posterior probability to 50%.

Further indicators come from the blood tests. The patient's low hemoglobin (6.1 g/dL) and hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear further increase the posterior probability of vitamin B12 deficiency to about 70%.

The elevated MCV (109 fL) is also in line with macrocytic anemia, which is common in vitamin B12 deficiency, increasing the posterior probability to 80%. The reduced platelet and total count also point to some form of bone marrow problem, which can be associated with severe vitamin B12 deficiency.

Finally, the negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies result argues against pernicious anemia, a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, but doesn't rule out other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, especially given the patient's vegetarian diet.",Vitamin B12 deficiency,Y
"A 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the emergency department by police after being found agitated and attempting to steal from a grocery store. His past medical history is only notable for a recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies.

Physical exam is notable for a man who is very irritable and restless. He is not cooperative with exam or history and becomes combative requiring intramuscular medications and security restraining him. After this event, the rest of his exam is notable for 7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin.

What substances was most likely used by this patient?",Cocaine,Stimulant,Y,Psychostimulants,N,Stimulant,Y,Stimulant,Y,Stimulants,Y,,"This patient's presentation of agitation, restlessness, combativeness, pupillary dilation (mydriasis), hypertension, and tachycardia may suggest a state of intoxication or overdose. Furthermore, the symptom of warm and sweaty skin suggests sympathetic overactivity. Given his psychiatric history of schizophrenia and the current presentation, the patient's symptoms may be due to the use of a stimulant. Among stimulants, amphetamines and cocaine can cause the manifestations seen in this patient. However, as the patient is still symptomatic after a time period long enough for him to be discovered, detained, and transported by police, which generally is longer than the duration of effects for cocaine, it's more likely that he used a substance with longer acting effects. Amphetamines, such as methamphetamine, typically have a longer duration of action than cocaine.",Amphetamines,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes illicit drug use (such as methamphetamines, cocaine, synthetic cannabinoids), medication side effect (e.g. anticholinergic, SSRIs), alcohol withdrawal, and antipsychotic-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
This patient is presenting with agitation, combativeness, hypertension, and hyperthermia, which could be seen in illicit drug use, specifically sympathomimetic toxidrome due to cocaine or methamphetamine use. He also has mydriasis (dilated pupils), which is common in sympathomimetic drugs. Other features of sympathomimetic toxidrome include tachycardia, and diaphoresis, which this patient also has.
NMS can be ruled out as it usually presents with generalized muscle rigidity (lead pipe rigidity), and altered mental status, but not typically with dilated pupils or heavy sweating. Alcohol withdrawal is less likely as it usually presents with tremors, seizures, and hallucinations. The patient's recent note of treatment for seasonal allergies could involve an antihistamine, but these usually cause pupil dilation with dry skin and other anticholinergic effects, not the sweaty skin observed.
Overall, the patient's clinical presentation most closely aligns with illicit drug use, most likely a sympathomimetic like methamphetamine or cocaine.",Methamphetamine or Cocaine,Y,"This patient presents with agitation, restlessness, combativeness, suicidal ideation, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, dilated pupils, and diaphoresis. These are all symptoms consistent with sympathomimetic toxicity, which could be caused by substances such as cocaine, methamphetamine, or other amphetamines. His recent treatment for allergies might have involved the use of over-the-counter decongestants, which can contain pseudoephedrine, a substance known to have sympathomimetic effects and often abused for its stimulant properties. However, given the severity of the symptoms, it is more likely that the patient has consumed a stronger illicit substance like cocaine or amphetamines.",Cocaine or Amphetamines,Y,"This patient presents with agitation, combative behavior, and suicidal ideation, alongside physiologic symptoms of increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and hyperthermia, which are suggestive of a sympathomimetic toxidrome. Sympathomimetic substances increase the levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine in the synaptic cleft, either by promoting their release, inhibiting their reuptake, or both, leading to overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Pupillary dilatation (mydriasis), as seen in this patient, is a common sign of sympathomimetic toxicity. Among the substances that can lead to this toxidrome, the most commonly abused include cocaine, amphetamines, and hallucinogens. However, hallucinogens typically do not cause significant agitation, whereas stimulants like amphetamines and cocaine do. Considering the severity of this patient's agitation, restlessness, and combativeness, his symptoms are most suggestive of abuse of a potent stimulant like amphetamines or cocaine. However, the increased temperature and skin diaphoresis are more characteristic of amphetamine toxicity, which can cause significant hyperthermia due to increased metabolic activity and impaired heat dissipation.",Amphetamines,Y,"The prior probability of illicit drug use, given the patient's presentation, is quite high - perhaps 50% - considering the agitation, combativeness, high blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and elevated temperature. These can all be symptoms of intoxication with stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine.

However, the presence of large, reactive pupils can suggest the use of hallucinogens or stimulants, which can increase the posterior probability of drug use to around 70%.

The patient's restlessness and combativeness could be related to agitation from schizophrenia, but when combined with physical symptoms such as pupil dilation and increased vital signs, it is more suggestive of intoxication or withdrawal, pushing the probability higher, say to around 80%.

Warm and sweaty skin can be caused by a number of drugs, including opioids, hallucinogens, and stimulants, further increasing the probability of drug use to around 85%.

Finally, the patient's suicidal ideation could be related to the psychiatric, psychological, and emotional effects of certain drug use, further increasing the likelihood of illicit drug use to above 90%. The symptoms given do not clearly point towards one specific drug but rather suggest a class of drugs - stimulants.",Stimulants,Y
"A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of worsening upper abdominal pain for the past 8 hours. She reports that the pain radiates to her back and is associated with nausea. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she takes enalapril, furosemide, and simvastatin. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure is 84/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 115/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness and guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased. Extremities are warm. Laboratory studies show:

What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities?",Capillary leakage,Acute pancreatitis,Y,Pancreatitis,Y,Pancreatitis,Y,Pancreatitis,Y,Pancreatitis,Y,,"This patient presents with upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, hypotension (low blood pressure), tachycardia (high heart rate), and increased amylase. These symptoms and laboratory findings suggest acute pancreatitis, a condition that can result in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) leading to distributive shock. This can explain the vital signs abnormalities: the body responds to the inflammation and decreased blood volume by increasing the heart rate (tachycardia) and, despite compensatory mechanisms, blood pressure can drop (hypotension). The warm extremities are a sign of peripheral vasodilation, another feature of distributive shock.",Acute pancreatitis,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: pancreatitis, cholecystitis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric outlet obstruction, and mesenteric ischemia. Considering her presentation with epigastric pain that radiates to the back, nausea, and laboratory results showing elevated amylase, she likely has pancreatitis. The hypotension and tachycardia she presents could be explained by the systemic inflammatory response, with resulting vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance that occurs in severe cases of pancreatitis. Furthermore, her use of furosemide, a diuretic, could also contribute to hypotension due to volume depletion. Given these findings, the patient's vital sign abnormalities are most likely due to severe pancreatitis.",Severe pancreatitis,Y,"This patient's presentation of severe upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back, nausea, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated amylase are indicative of acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to her hyperlipidemia. Her elevated hematocrit may reflect hemoconcentration due to the severe inflammation and fluid sequestration within the retroperitoneal space, and her elevated urea nitrogen suggests decreased renal perfusion secondary to hypovolemia. Both hypovolemia and hypotension are commonly seen in acute pancreatitis due to third spacing of fluids into the inflamed and edematous pancreas and surrounding tissues.",Acute pancreatitis,Y,"This patient is presenting with severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, hypotension (BP of 84/58 mm Hg), tachycardia (pulse of 115/min), abdominal distention, epigastric tenderness and guarding, and an elevated amylase level, all of which are suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis include gallstones and alcohol. Given that there's no mention of alcohol abuse, and she has hyperlipidemia (a risk factor for gallstone disease), the most likely underlying cause of her pancreatitis could be gallstones. The decreased blood pressure and elevated heart rate indicate systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), a common complication in acute pancreatitis caused by release of inflammatory mediators leading to increased vascular permeability and vasodilation.",Gallstones,N,"The Bayesian process starts with a prior probability, which is updated with new information to give a posterior probability.

The prior probability of hypovolemic shock in a 55-year-old woman presenting with abdominal pain and low blood pressure is about 10%.

The presence of tachycardia increases the posterior probability of hypovolemic shock to around 20%. Tachycardia is often an initial physiological response to decreased intravascular volume in an effort to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.

The presence of abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness and guarding increases the probability further to around 50%. These symptoms could be indicative of an intra-abdominal process, such as bleeding or pancreatitis, that could result in hypovolemic shock.

The patient's warm extremities increase the probability to 60%. Peripheral vasodilation, which can present as warm extremities, can occur in the early stages of shock as the body attempts to maximize blood flow to the tissues.

An elevated hematocrit can also be seen in hypovolemic shock due to hemoconcentration from fluid loss. This increases the probability to around 75%.

The elevated urea nitrogen could reflect reduced renal perfusion due to hypovolemia, pushing the probability to around 85%.

Given these factors, it is highly likely that this patient's vital sign abnormalities are due to hypovolemic shock, most likely due to an intra-abdominal process such as bleeding or pancreatitis.",Hypovolemic shock,N
"A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?",Clostridium tetani,Tetanus,Y,Group B Streptococcus,N,Group B Streptococcus,N,Bacterial infection,N,Tetanus,Y,,"This infant's clinical picture is suggestive of neonatal tetanus. The characteristic features in this case are the trismus (or lockjaw, as evidenced by the difficulty in latching and feeding), generalized increased muscle tone, and the spasms or ""clenched"" states of his jaw and hands. Tetanus is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin leading to these severe muscle contractions. The absence of prenatal care, home birth without sterile precautions, and unvaccinated status of the mother (who thus couldn't pass on passive immunity to the infant) further increase the risk of this diagnosis.",Clostridium tetani,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include conditions like neonatal sepsis, meningitis, hypernatremic dehydration, or a metabolic disorder. However, considering the presentation of the child with refusal to feed, increased muscle tone, clenched jaw (trismus), no head lag (indicative of hyperexcitability or spasticity), and clenched hands, this suggests a neuromuscular disorder, such as neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is a complication associated with unhygienic delivery practices, often seen in countries with inadequate maternal immunization. In neonatal tetanus, Clostridium tetani spores contaminate the umbilical stump, leading to generalized rigidity and convulsions. Given that the child was delivered at home without any medical supervision, there is a high risk of contamination of the umbilical stump by Clostridium tetani. The normal screening bloodwork makes metabolic disorders less likely, and there is no clear indication of sepsis or meningitis from the history or physical examination.",Clostridium tetani,Y,"The infant is presenting with poor feeding, increased muscle tone, clenched jaw (also known as trismus), clenched hands, and no head lag. These are classic symptoms of neonatal tetanus. Tetanus is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which releases a neurotoxin leading to unopposed muscle contraction and rigidity. The traditional home birth and lack of prenatal care are significant risk factors as neonatal tetanus often occurs when non-sterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord. Additionally, the mother's lack of vaccination means that the child didn't receive passive immunity to this organism.",Clostridium tetani,Y,"The infant's presentation of poor feeding, trouble latching, a clenched jaw (indicative of trismus), increased muscle tone, and clenched hands are classic signs of neonatal tetanus. Tetanus is caused by the Clostridium tetani bacterium, which is prevalent in soil and dust. As the mother had a home birth and has never seen a medical provider, it is likely that non-sterile conditions during delivery could have allowed for contamination of the birth canal or umbilical stump with C. tetani. This bacterium produces a toxin that leads to muscle rigidity and spasms, explaining the observed symptoms. Also, the lack of prenatal care and unvaccinated status of the mother suggest that the infant didn't receive maternal antibodies against tetanus.",Clostridium tetani,Y,"The prior probability of Clostridium tetani (the bacterium causing tetanus) infection in the general population is extremely low due to widespread vaccination, however, this case has several indicators that would significantly increase the posterior probability. The key indicators are:

Lack of prenatal care and vaccination in mother: Tetanus immunity is usually conferred to the newborn through maternal antibodies if the mother is immunized. In this case, the mother is unvaccinated which increases the probability of Clostridium tetani infection to about 15%.

Traditional home birth: Unsterile conditions during birth and potentially the cutting of the umbilical cord can lead to infection. This would further increase the probability of Clostridium tetani to about 40%.

Characteristic symptoms: The infant has a clenched jaw (trismus), increased muscle tone, and refusal to feed, all of which are consistent with neonatal tetanus. These symptoms would further increase the posterior probability of Clostridium tetani infection to about 90%.

In conclusion, given the lack of prenatal care, the unvaccinated status of the mother, the home birth, and the characteristic symptoms, the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation is Clostridium tetani.",Clostridium tetani,Y
"A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. What is most likely injured in this patient?",Supraspinatus,Rotator cuff tear,Y,Rotator cuff tear,Y,Rotator cuff tear,Y,Rotator cuff tear,Y,Rotator cuff tear,Y,,"This patient's symptoms point to an injury in his rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that surround the shoulder joint, providing stability and enabling the lifting and rotation of the arm. In this case, the patient's onset of pain and weakness following a move, which worsened with exercise, are indicative of a rotator cuff injury. His physical examination findings further support this diagnosis. His difficulty with external rotation and sudden dropping of the arm during the lowering phase (positive drop-arm sign) suggest a severe injury, such as a tear, to the rotator cuff, especially to the supraspinatus muscle, which is often the most commonly affected muscle in rotator cuff injuries. His weakness in abduction also supports this, as the rotator cuff muscles, particularly the supraspinatus, are crucial for this movement.",Rotator cuff injury,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: rotator cuff tear, impingement syndrome, bursitis, tendinitis, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), and osteoarthritis. The fact that this patient has weakness of external rotation suggests rotator cuff injury as the external rotators (specifically the infraspinatus muscle) are part of the rotator cuff. The patient's inability to slowly lower his arm from an overhead position, a positive drop arm sign, is indicative of a rotator cuff tear. Furthermore, this patient's risk factors including his age and diabetes could predispose him to having a rotator cuff tear. Therefore, a rotator cuff tear is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Rotator cuff tear,Y,"This patient's clinical presentation of right shoulder pain, weakness, especially in external rotation and during abduction, and the inability to slowly lower his arm from an overhead position (positive drop arm test) are consistent with a rotator cuff tear. Rotator cuff tears are common in individuals who engage in heavy lifting or repetitive overhead movements, particularly in older individuals, and they can be exacerbated by activities like weightlifting. The rotator cuff is comprised of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Among these, the supraspinatus muscle is most commonly injured. It is responsible for initiating the first 15 degrees of arm abduction, hence the weakness in arm abduction seen in this patient.",Supraspinatus muscle,Y,"The patient presents with symptoms indicative of a rotator cuff injury, more specifically a possible tear, as the muscles and tendons that comprise the rotator cuff are responsible for shoulder stabilization and movement. This is evidenced by the significant weakness in external rotation and abduction (motions facilitated by the rotator cuff), the painful ""drop arm sign"" (where the patient cannot slowly lower the arm from an elevated position, suggestive of a rotator cuff tear), and the exacerbation of symptoms with lifting activities. The most frequently injured muscle in the rotator cuff is the supraspinatus muscle, as its tendon passes beneath the acromion and can be easily damaged, particularly in individuals who perform overhead activities, like this patient when helping his son move.",Supraspinatus muscle,Y,"The prior probability of a rotator cuff tear is around 5% in individuals over the age of 60. However, in this case, the patient has reported activity (heavy lifting while moving), which is a common cause of this injury, increasing the posterior probability to about 20%.

The drop-arm sign (the inability to lower the arm slowly from an overhead position) is a classic symptom of rotator cuff tear, increasing the probability to around 70%. The substantial weakness (1/5) in arm abduction is another strong indicator, further raising the probability to 90%. Therefore, it is most likely that the patient has suffered a rotator cuff tear.",Rotator cuff tear,Y
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a right breast mass that she noticed 3 weeks ago. It has rapidly increased in size during this period. She does not have pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. There is no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia.

The physical examination reveals a large, nontender, multinodular mass in the right outer quadrant of her breast. Importantly, the mammography results reveal a smooth polylobulated mass, which is not usually indicative of malignancy. Instead, such features often point to a fibroadenoma or an intraductal papilloma, especially considering the rapid growth. The biopsy results, however, reveal papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. This atypia and hyperplasia make it less likely to be a benign fibroadenoma. These findings, along with the rapid growth and the lack of other classic cancer symptoms (such as nipple retraction, skin changes, or lymphadenopathy), make intraductal papilloma a likely diagnosis. However, the size and atypical cells found in the biopsy make it more likely to be a specific type of intraductal papilloma known as papilloma with atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) or possibly papilloma with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).",Papilloma with Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, breast abscess, and fibrocystic changes. A fibroadenoma usually presents as a firm, mobile, non-tender mass and is most common in young women, but they are typically well circumscribed and not multinodular or rapidly enlarging. Fibrocystic changes are common and can cause a lumpy texture in the breast, but these changes are usually bilateral and often vary with the menstrual cycle. A breast abscess might cause a rapidly enlarging mass, but this patient has no symptoms of infection such as pain, redness, or fever. A phyllodes tumor is a rare breast tumor that can grow rapidly, presents as a large, multinodular mass, and mammography may show a polylobulated mass.

The key to the diagnosis lies in the direct immunofluorescence findings of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane. These deposits indicate an autoimmune process, in which the body's own immune system is producing antibodies that are attacking components of the skin. The specific pattern of these deposits, being linear along the basement membrane, is characteristic of a condition known as bullous pemphigoid.",Bullous pemphigoid,Y,"The differential for this patient includes conditions like pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and contact dermatitis.

The presence of tense bullae that do not rupture easily makes a blistering disorder such as pemphigus vulgaris or bullous pemphigoid more likely, as these conditions are characterized by the formation of tense bullae. However, in pemphigus vulgaris, the bullae are typically fragile and easily rupture, which is not the case in this patient.

Furthermore, the direct immunofluorescence findings of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane are more consistent with bullous pemphigoid, as pemphigus vulgaris usually shows intraepidermal deposits.

Therefore, taking into account the patient's clinical picture and the results of the direct immunofluorescence, the most likely diagnosis in this case is bullous pemphigoid.",Bullous Pemphigoid,Y,"This patient has presented with itchy, tense axillary bullae that do not rupture easily, suggesting a form of blistering skin disease.

His symptoms are indicative of an adjustment in his circadian rhythm due to the change in his work schedule. His condition can be termed as an Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder (ASPD), which is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by a habitual sleep-wake schedule that is shifted earlier than the social norms.",Advanced Sleep Phase Disorder,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include several sleep disorders, including insomnia, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, circadian rhythm sleep disorder, or narcolepsy. Given that the patient's sleep appears peaceful and he feels rested when awake, we can likely rule out sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome, both of which would cause disruptions in sleep and potential daytime sleepiness. Narcolepsy typically presents with excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, or hypnagogic hallucinations, which this patient does not seem to have.

Given the patient's recent retirement and his previous work schedule on the day shift, the most likely diagnosis is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder, specifically ""advanced sleep phase syndrome"" (ASPS). ASPS is characterized by the individual's sleep-wake cycle being several hours ahead of a conventional sleep schedule, leading to early evening sleepiness and early morning awakening.

Physical examination reveals tenderness over the anteromedial proximal tibia, but no joint effusion, which would suggest intra-articular pathology like osteoarthritis or meniscal tears, which are less likely. The negative valgus stress testing further rules out ligamentous injury. Radiographic imaging shows only mild arthritis and does not show any fractures or other structural abnormalities, making other potential diagnoses like osteoarthritis less likely. Her obesity might also contribute to the development of PFPS due to increased loading on the knee joint. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is patellofemoral pain syndrome.",Patellofemoral pain syndrome,N,"The differential for this patient includes: patellofemoral pain syndrome, medial meniscus tear, osteoarthritis, pes anserinus bursitis, medial collateral ligament injury, and patellar tendinitis. She is obese and has a three-month history of knee pain that is worse with stairs or rising from a chair, which is consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome, osteoarthritis, and medial meniscus tear. She has tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial proximal tibia but no joint effusion, which is less likely in osteoarthritis and medial meniscus tear but more consistent with pes anserinus bursitis. Radiographs showing only mild arthritis also point away from osteoarthritis being the primary cause of her symptoms. Valgus stress testing being negative makes medial collateral ligament injury unlikely. Based on her symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, this patient most likely has pes anserinus bursitis.",Pes anserinus bursitis,Y,"The patient's symptoms include pain in the knee that worsens with weight-bearing activities, such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair, and localized tenderness over the anteromedial proximal tibia, which is part of the knee joint. However, the physical examination findings rule out instability of the knee joint or any effusion, indicating that there's no severe inflammatory process occurring in the joint. Furthermore, the radiographs rule out fractures or bony lesions. Taking into consideration the fact that the patient is obese, the symptoms and the location of pain, the most likely diagnosis is Pes Anserine Bursitis, which is an inflammation of the bursa located between the shin bone (tibia) and three tendons of the hamstring muscle at the inside of the knee. This condition is commonly seen in obese individuals and is associated with activities that involve repeated knee flexion or strain.",Pes Anserine Bursitis,Y,"The patient's knee pain, particularly with activities involving knee flexion such as climbing stairs and rising from a chair, suggests patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). This condition is often associated with obesity, as extra weight can put increased stress on the knees, particularly during activities involving knee bending. The pain in PFPS often is located at the front of the knee, below the kneecap, which aligns with this patient's report. The pain also often worsens with prolonged sitting with bent knees or when rising from a seated position. The lack of any signs of significant arthritis, fracture, or bony lesions on radiographs also supports a diagnosis of PFPS, as these findings may be present in other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as osteoarthritis or meniscal injury. The negative valgus stress test rules out a medial collateral ligament injury. Therefore, this patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with PFPS.",Patellofemoral pain syndrome,N,"The prior probability of pes anserine bursitis in patients with similar demographics is around 2%. The presence of pain localized over the anteromedial proximal tibia, specifically 6 cm below the joint line, increases the likelihood of this condition to 25%. The report of pain being worse during activities like stair-climbing or rising from a chair, typical of pes anserine bursitis, further increases the likelihood to 45%. The absence of evidence for fractures, bony lesions, or joint effusion on the radiograph, as well as a negative valgus stress test, reduces the likelihood of other knee pathologies like ligamentous injury or severe osteoarthritis, pushing the posterior probability of pes anserine bursitis to around 60%. This patient most likely has pes anserine bursitis.",Pes anserine bursitis,Y
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia.

This condition is known as internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which often presents bilaterally in young adults. INO occurs due to lesions in the MLF, a tract that coordinates the lateral gaze by connecting the abducens nucleus of one side to the oculomotor nucleus of the opposite side. Bilateral disc hyperemia, which suggests inflammation or swelling, may indicate an underlying cause for these findings. In young adults, the most common cause of bilateral INO is Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease that often presents with visual and coordination problems.",Multiple Sclerosis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's symptoms includes a variety of neurological conditions, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, or cranial nerve palsy. The symptom of double vision (diplopia) when looking sideways suggests a disorder of the lateral rectus (controlled by cranial nerve VI, the abducens nerve) or the medial rectus muscles (controlled by cranial nerve III, the oculomotor nerve). However, since the patient can't adduct either eye (a function of the medial rectus muscle) when looking in the opposite direction, but does have nystagmus in the abducting eye, this suggests a disorder called Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is typically caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), a pathway that connects cranial nerve VI nucleus on one side to the cranial nerve III nucleus on the other, and coordinates the movements of the two eyes. This condition is common in young adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) - a demyelinating condition that would match the symptom onset pattern of the patient. Additionally, the patient's recent loss of balance might also suggest an MS, as balance issues can arise from demyelination in the cerebellum or spinal cord. The bilateral disc hyperemia observed on fundoscopy could indicate optic neuritis, another common symptom of MS.",Multiple Sclerosis,Y,"The patient's symptoms of adduction deficits and nystagmus in the opposite eye when looking left or right suggest a diagnosis of Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is a disorder of conjugate lateral gaze in which the affected eye shows impairment of adduction. When an attempt is made to gaze contralaterally (relative to the affected eye), the affected eye adducts minimally, if at all. The contralateral eye abducts, often with nystagmus. This condition is often seen in young adults due to multiple sclerosis and in older adults due to small vessel ischemic disease.",Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia,Y,"The patient presents with double vision, specifically on horizontal gaze, along with nystagmus and adduction deficit in the eye opposite to the direction of gaze. These symptoms suggest a disorder of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, a set of axons that run near the midline of the brainstem and help coordinate lateral eye movements. This condition is known as internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). Most commonly, INO is caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) in young adults, especially in women. It's noteworthy that the patient also presents with bilateral disc hyperemia, which could be due to optic neuritis, another common symptom of MS. Despite her recent fall and head CT showing no abnormalities, the temporal relationship and the specific ocular findings more strongly suggest a neurological cause like MS than a traumatic one.",Multiple sclerosis,Y,"The prior probability of Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia (INO) in a young individual is typically quite low, let's say 1%. However, we have several key pieces of information to consider. The woman has double vision that worsens when looking sideways, a cardinal symptom of INO, which could increase our posterior probability to around 20%. Furthermore, when examining the patient, we observe she has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left, and the reverse when looking right. These findings align perfectly with INO, thus significantly increasing our posterior probability to about 80%. Finally, the bilateral disc hyperemia seen on fundoscopy can be indicative of inflammatory or demyelinating conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, which is a common cause of INO in young individuals. This further bolsters our posterior probability to around 95%. The recent trauma doesn't seem to be connected to her symptoms, and her use of an oral contraceptive does not bear any clear relevance. Given these findings, our patient most likely has INO, potentially secondary to an underlying condition like Multiple Sclerosis.",Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia,Y
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination for the past 6 days. Three weeks ago, she had an episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that was treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with multiple male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently; she has been taking an oral contraceptive for the past 2 years. She has no previous history of serious illness or sexually transmitted diseases. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg.

These symptoms, in addition to the elevated vaginal pH (>4.5), are indicative of an infection with Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted protozoan. Trichomonas infection often becomes symptomatic following a course of antibiotics, as the antibiotics can disrupt the normal vaginal flora, allowing overgrowth of the protozoan. This patient's recent course of amoxicillin for her rhinosinusitis could have set the stage for her symptoms to manifest. In the setting of these symptoms and her history, a microscopic evaluation of her vaginal discharge is most likely to show motile, flagellated cells, which are characteristic of Trichomonas vaginalis.","Motile, flagellated cells",Y,"The patient's symptoms - yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination - along with the physical findings of vulvar and vaginal erythema and a frothy, yellow-green, foul-smelling vaginal discharge, suggest a sexually transmitted infection. The increased vaginal pH (normal is 3.8 to 4.5) supports a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis or a trichomoniasis infection, however, the presence of a frothy, foul-smelling discharge is more characteristic of trichomoniasis. Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan that is usually transmitted sexually. In addition to the symptoms and signs already mentioned, it may cause an increase in vaginal pH because the organism is able to survive in a more alkaline environment. Wet mount microscopy of vaginal discharge in trichomoniasis would likely reveal motile trichomonads and numerous white blood cells.",Motile trichomonads,Y,"The prior probability of Trichomonas vaginalis infection is around 5% in sexually active women. However, this patient's presentation includes multiple symptoms and signs that would adjust this probability.

Foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge increases the probability of Trichomonas vaginalis infection to 20%.
A vaginal pH greater than 4.5, in this case 5.8, further raises the probability to 40%.
Vulvovaginal erythema aligns with the inflammation caused by Trichomonas vaginalis, pushing the posterior probability to 60%.
Finally, the patient's sexual history of multiple partners and inconsistent condom use greatly increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection like Trichomonas vaginalis, raising the final probability to 80%.
Given these factors, further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show the characteristic findings of a Trichomonas vaginalis infection.",Trichomonas vaginalis flagellates,Y
A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months.

They have also tried in vitro fertilization (IVF), which bypasses many common issues such as blocked fallopian tubes, but without success. Given her age, prior successful pregnancy, regular menses, and unsuccessful IVF attempt, one possible factor that could be influencing her fertility is unexplained infertility. Unexplained infertility occurs when doctors have ruled out all the common causes of infertility but the couple is still unable to conceive. The patient's sleep problems and trouble concentrating could be related to stress or anxiety, which some studies suggest may impact fertility, but more research is needed to confirm this connection.",Unexplained infertility,N,"The differential for this patient's infertility can include male factor, ovulatory disorders, tubal disease, endometriosis, uterine abnormalities, and unexplained infertility. Given that the husband's semen analysis was normal, male factor can be ruled out. The woman has regular, predictable menstrual cycles which suggests ovulation is likely occurring normally, ruling out ovulatory disorders. No physical abnormalities were detected on examination, making endometriosis and uterine abnormalities less likely. While a hysterosalpingogram (HSG) or laparoscopy would be necessary to definitively rule out tubal disease, there is no history given that would particularly suggest this (e.g., history of sexually transmitted infections, abdominal surgeries, ectopic pregnancy). Lastly, she has already had a successful pregnancy, making both tubal disease and uterine abnormalities even less likely. Therefore, this leaves us with the diagnosis of unexplained infertility, which is given when standard evaluations for infertility don't reveal a cause.",Unexplained infertility,N,"Given that this patient has regular 28-day menstrual cycles and previously had an uncomplicated pregnancy, there is no immediate indication of primary ovarian insufficiency or anatomical abnormalities. Her husband's sperm analysis also returned normal results, ruling out male factor infertility. However, she has been experiencing stress, as suggested by her symptoms of sleeping problems and difficulty concentrating, which can contribute to difficulties with conception. Chronic stress can interfere with the hormones needed for ovulation, fertilization, and implantation. Psychological factors should always be considered in cases of unexplained infertility.",Stress-related infertility,N,"The 35-year-old woman has been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Given that the husband's semen analysis showed normal sperm counts and morphology, it can be inferred that male infertility is not the issue here. Additionally, she has regular menstrual cycles and a previous uncomplicated pregnancy, suggesting normal ovulatory function and uterine environment. However, one crucial factor that hasn't been mentioned is the condition of the fallopian tubes, which could be a potential barrier to conception if they were blocked or damaged. In vitro fertilization bypasses the tubes and yet she was unsuccessful in conceiving, so the problem may not be solely with the tubes but also could involve a decline in egg quality, which can occur with age, or other issues with the fertilization process. But as no specific clinical indications or medical history to suspect poor egg quality or fertilization issues are given, the most probable cause in this context could be a tubal factor.",Tubal factor infertility,N,"The prior probability of this patient having infertility related to age is low given her age of 35. Since her menses occur regularly, the probability of anovulation causing infertility also remains low. The fact that her husband's semen analysis is normal eliminates male factor as a possible cause of infertility. In vitro fertilization has been attempted unsuccessfully, which could indicate problems at the level of the ovary, fallopian tubes, or uterus. Since she has a history of a term pregnancy, uterine factors are less likely, making fallopian tube disease or ovarian factors more probable.

His exposure to high temperatures at a construction site coupled with the intake of drugs such as haloperidol and phenytoin - both of which can predispose to Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) and malignant hyperthermia - may have exacerbated an underlying condition. However, NMS usually presents with lead-pipe rigidity rather than minimal muscle tone. Furthermore, the recent anesthesia could have triggered malignant hyperthermia, but this typically occurs during or shortly after anesthesia, not several months later. Taking all these factors into consideration, the most likely diagnosis is heat stroke, which is characterized by a high body temperature, altered mental or behavioral state, and signs of organ dysfunction. This condition would be further exacerbated by the propranolol, which blunts the normal physiologic response to heat exposure, thereby predisposing this patient to heat stroke.",Heat stroke,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include severe dehydration, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome, anticholinergic toxicity, and thyroid storm. Considering the patient's current medications and symptoms, some diagnoses become more likely.

His significantly elevated temperature, altered mental status, tachycardia, and noted minimal muscle tone along with the history of being on haloperidol point to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction to antipsychotic drugs. It is characterized by a tetrad of fever, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation.

Severe dehydration and heat stroke are also possible given his work as a construction worker, but the absence of any environmental context suggesting extreme heat or lack of water availability makes these less likely. Additionally, his symptoms seem more acute and severe than would be expected with dehydration.

Malignant hyperthermia is typically associated with exposure to certain drugs used during general anesthesia (such as succinylcholine and volatile anesthetics), and the onset is usually immediate during or after anesthesia - not several months later, making this less likely.

Serotonin syndrome could present similarly but he is not on any serotonergic medications.

Anticholinergic toxicity could also present with altered mental status and elevated temperature, but the patient would also typically exhibit dry skin and mucous membranes, not be covered in sweat.

A thyroid storm could cause high temperature and altered mental status, but this condition would likely cause a high blood pressure, not a relatively normal one like our patient has, and the patient is on propranolol which would also help control the symptoms of a thyroid storm.

Therefore, the patient most likely has central cord syndrome.",Central cord syndrome,Y
"A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic.

These symptoms suggest a psychological response to traumatic experiences, which fits the description of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).",Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. This patient is reporting upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks related to his traumatic experience during active duty, which are symptoms characteristic of PTSD. Additionally, PTSD has a duration of symptoms for more than one month and typically begins within 3 months after the trauma, which matches the timeline given in this case. Acute stress disorder is similar to PTSD, but the symptoms occur between 3 days and 4 weeks following the trauma. The patient's symptoms have been present for 7 weeks, thus ruling out acute stress disorder. Panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression may also present with anxiety and disturbed sleep, but do not usually involve trauma-specific flashbacks or triggering by reminders of the trauma, as this patient has. Hence, this patient most likely has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).",Post-traumatic stress disorder,Y,"The patient has been experiencing upsetting dreams, anxiety, and flashbacks, especially in relation to traumatic experiences he had while on active duty in Iraq. The onset of symptoms appears to be within 6 months of the traumatic experience, which meets the criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

All these findings strongly suggest PTSD.",Post-traumatic stress disorder,Y,"The prior probability of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in a veteran with active duty in a combat zone is estimated to be 15%. The patient's intense fear of loud noises (hypervigilance) increases the probability of PTSD to 30%. Experiencing flashbacks to traumatic events further increases the probability to 50%. The disruption of his normal functioning due to these symptoms, demonstrated by him having to take leave from his duties, increases the probability of PTSD to 70%. Furthermore, his avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic events (not leaving the house) increases the probability of PTSD to 85%.

"A 78-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue and headache for 6 months and occasional abdominal pain. He has not had any changes in his weight. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic shoulder pain. Current daily medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and ibuprofen. He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke. His diet has mostly consisted of potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago. His pulse is 92/min and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival and mucosal pallor. Abdominal and rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological exam shows mild postural tremor.

These are all signs of anemia, which can be caused by various factors such as bleeding, decreased production, or increased destruction of red blood cells. Given this patient's age, diet, and medications, a dietary deficiency like iron or B12 deficiency is less likely. However, his diet is noted to consist mainly of potatoes and lean meats, with no mention of foods rich in vitamin B12, which may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency over time, causing megaloblastic anemia. The blood smear findings are not typical for this, but a B12 deficiency can sometimes cause different presentations. Chronic use of ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can also cause gastritis or ulcers leading to chronic blood loss and hence iron-deficiency anemia, but the blood smear findings of increased central pallor and anisocytosis are more in line with iron-deficiency anemia. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is chronic blood loss secondary to chronic ibuprofen use, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.",Chronic ibuprofen use.,N,"The differential for this patient's presentation includes: iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, folic acid deficiency, chronic disease anemia, hypothyroidism, and malignancy. Considering his diet, history, and lab findings, several diagnoses rise to the top. His diet, mostly of potatoes and lean meats, makes a nutritional deficiency such as iron or vitamin B12 deficiency more likely. However, the peripheral blood smear showing red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor (hypochromic) and anisocytosis (varying sizes) is more typical of iron deficiency anemia. Moreover, his chronic use of ibuprofen can lead to gastrointestinal blood loss, which can also cause iron deficiency anemia. The other differentials are less likely based on the presented information. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue but is less likely to cause pallor and anisocytosis. Chronic disease anemia usually does not present with hypochromic red blood cells. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause anemia and neurological symptoms, but it typically results in macrocytic anemia and more significant neurological symptoms. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is iron deficiency anemia due to potential chronic gastrointestinal blood loss from long-term ibuprofen use and poor diet.",Iron Deficiency Anemia,Y,"This patient presents with fatigue, headache, and conjunctival and mucosal pallor, all of which are suggestive of anemia. The peripheral blood smear showing red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. His diet, mostly consisting of potatoes and lean meats, may not provide sufficient iron, leading to iron deficiency. Also, his chronic use of ibuprofen could lead to gastrointestinal bleeding, which might be a source of iron loss. Therefore, iron deficiency, due to poor dietary intake and potential blood loss, is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms.",Iron deficiency anemia,Y,"The patient's symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and the physical finding of conjunctival and mucosal pallor suggest anemia. The peripheral blood smear reveals red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis, which indicates iron deficiency anemia (IDA). The most common causes of IDA in the elderly are gastrointestinal blood loss and poor nutrition. The patient's diet of mostly potatoes and lean meats may be low in iron, contributing to the development of IDA. Additionally, his daily use of ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may lead to GI bleeding and thus iron loss, especially in the elderly. Furthermore, he may not be supplementing the iron lost in his diet due to the relative lack of iron-rich foods in his diet. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is iron deficiency, secondary to poor nutrition and possible GI blood loss due to NSAID use.",Iron deficiency anemia,Y,"The prior probability of iron deficiency anemia in this patient, considering his age and sex, could be around 2%.

"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision where he was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is unconscious. His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. What was the most likely diagnosis?",Cardiac contusion,Traumatic cardiac tamponade.,N,Traumatic shock,N,Cardiac tamponade,N,Cardiac tamponade,N,Tension pneumothorax,N,,"This patient presented after a motor vehicle collision, and his clinical picture suggests severe trauma. His initial physical examination showed multiple ecchymoses over the chest, high jugular venous pressure, and bilateral crackles at the lung bases, indicative of possible thoracic injury. Cardiac examination was notably without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His electrocardiogram showed absent p-waves, suggesting arrhythmia. Importantly, his condition deteriorated rapidly with a decreasing blood pressure despite aggressive resuscitation, including fluid replacement and vasopressors. These symptoms combined point to a likely diagnosis of traumatic cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood or fluid fills the space between the heart muscle and the outer covering sac of the heart, impairing heart function.",Traumatic cardiac tamponade,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes blunt cardiac injury, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, aortic dissection, and severe hemorrhage. The patient's presentation with a rapid, irregularly irregular rhythm, lack of response to fluid resuscitation, and high jugular venous pressure is suggestive of cardiac involvement. The FAST scan is negative, which makes intra-abdominal hemorrhage unlikely. Blunt cardiac injury could manifest as arrhythmias but would not usually result in such severe hypotension. The lack of response to fluid resuscitation, as well as the increased jugular venous pressure, are highly suggestive of a pericardial effusion and tamponade, which could be due to a traumatic rupture of the heart. In this context, the arrhythmia is most likely due to atrial fibrillation induced by the acute stress and hemodynamic instability. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is cardiac tamponade.",Cardiac tamponade,N,"This patient presents with multiple signs and symptoms suggestive of cardiac tamponade, including hypotension, tachycardia, increased jugular venous pressure (JVP), and muffled heart sounds. Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, leading to increased intrapericardial pressure, which impairs ventricular filling and leads to decreased cardiac output. In this case, the trauma from the motor vehicle accident likely led to a rupture of a part of the heart or major vessels, causing bleeding into the pericardial sac. This, coupled with the high-speed nature of the motor vehicle collision, the observed physical injuries, and the sudden and rapid clinical deterioration, points to cardiac tamponade as the most probable cause of death. The FAST exam could be falsely negative due to operator error or early-stage tamponade not showing as clearly. His ECG findings of absent P waves may indicate atrial fibrillation, which could be due to his critical condition rather than the cause of it.",Cardiac Tamponade,N,"This patient's signs and symptoms suggest traumatic cardiac injury, possibly a cardiac tamponade. Evidence pointing towards this includes: multiple ecchymoses over the chest indicative of blunt chest trauma, increased jugular venous pressure, absence of murmur, rub or gallop in the cardiac examination, absent P-waves in ECG and unresponsiveness to fluid resuscitation or vasopressors. The absence of P-waves can signify atrial standstill, which is often due to increased intrapericardial pressure. The clinical picture fits Beck's triad of cardiac tamponade: hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds. Therefore, the most likely cause of death is cardiac tamponade secondary to trauma.",Cardiac Tamponade,N,"This patient presented with a history of a motor vehicle collision, unconsciousness, hypotension, tachycardia, and increased jugular venous pressure. The prior probability of tension pneumothorax is about 5%. The presentation of hypotension, tachycardia, and increased jugular venous pressure, known as Beck's triad, which is suggestive of cardiac tamponade, increases the probability to 30%. The negative FAST scan reduces the likelihood of intra-abdominal bleeding, refocusing the differential diagnosis back to the thoracic region, and pushing the probability up to 50%. The absence of p-waves in the ECG can suggest electrical activity of the heart being disturbed by a pressure in the thoracic cavity, increasing the probability to 70%. Despite the use of fluid resuscitation and vasopressors, the patient's vital signs did not improve, suggesting that the problem was a mechanical obstruction, not a volume or systemic issue, pushing the posterior probability to 90%. This strongly suggests cardiac tamponade, likely secondary to a traumatic rupture of the heart or major vessels due to the accident.",Cardiac tamponade,N

Combined with the laboratory findings of low Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), low Thyroxine, and decreased levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), the clinical picture suggests a disorder of the pituitary gland, which is responsible for producing several hormones including TSH and growth hormone (which stimulates IGF-1 production). His vision problems and headaches may be caused by a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor that is pressing on the optic chiasm, causing bumping into obstacles due to impaired peripheral vision. All these findings suggest a condition known as pituitary dwarfism, or growth hormone deficiency.",Pituitary dwarfism,N,"The differential for this patient could include hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, constitutional growth delay, familial short stature, and diabetes insipidus.

However, his thyroxine level is normal, ruling out hypothyroidism. His low Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and normal Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) point towards growth hormone deficiency. However, his excessive thirst, increased urination, and nocturnal headaches are symptoms of diabetes insipidus. The lack of changes in his clothing or shoe size over the past year and the headaches suggest the possibility of a pituitary tumor causing both growth hormone deficiency and diabetes insipidus.

This condition is often associated with low levels of hormones that are regulated by the pituitary gland, such as TSH and growth hormone (reflected by the low IGF-1 level). Additionally, the presence of headaches and visual disturbances are classic signs of a pituitary tumor. Polyuria and polydipsia are signs of diabetes insipidus, which can also be caused by pituitary disorders. Overall, the boy's symptoms and the laboratory findings point towards a problem with the pituitary gland, most likely a pituitary adenoma.",Pituitary adenoma,Y,"The patient's symptoms - short stature, frequent bumps into obstacles (suggesting vision problems), increased thirst and urination, and nocturnal headaches - suggest a pituitary problem, more specifically, a growth hormone deficiency and diabetes insipidus, both of which can be caused by a pituitary tumor. The presence of a pituitary tumor is further suggested by the boy's nocturnal headaches and vision problems (likely due to the tumor's pressure on the optic chiasm). Additionally, the laboratory results show a low level of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is produced in response to growth hormone and is often used as a surrogate marker for growth hormone levels. Given the combination of symptoms and these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary tumor causing both growth hormone deficiency and diabetes insipidus.",Pituitary Tumor,Y,"The prior probability of growth hormone deficiency is about 1 in 4000 in children. However, this child has several signs and symptoms suggestive of this condition, such as short stature (with the child being in the 5th percentile for height) and the lack of change in clothing or shoe size over the past year, which would likely increase the posterior probability to around 10%.

The child's frequent thirst and urination could suggest diabetes insipidus, a condition that can be associated with growth hormone deficiency and can increase the posterior probability of growth hormone deficiency to 20%.

The child's lab results also support this diagnosis. The abnormally low levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) are a strong indicator of growth hormone deficiency, likely increasing the posterior probability to around 80%.

Lastly, the patient's mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis, a condition that can be associated with pituitary problems in some cases. While this doesn't directly indicate growth hormone deficiency, it might marginally increase the probability.

Taking all of these factors together, growth hormone deficiency appears to be the most likely diagnosis for this patient.",Growth Hormone Deficiency,N
"A 45-year-old woman presents to the physician with a history of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis.

Serum epinephrine is also elevated, which fits with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient has high levels of calcitonin and parathormone, which are hormones related to calcium metabolism, and this is consistent with the patient's hypercalcemia. These findings, in addition to the patient's diffuse and firm thyromegaly, suggest that the patient might have Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN), a condition characterized by tumors in more than one endocrine gland. There are three types of MEN, and given this patient's elevated calcitonin levels, pheochromocytoma, and thyromegaly (suggestive of medullary thyroid carcinoma), the most likely diagnosis is Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A).",Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2A,Y,"The differential diagnoses for this patient includes: pheochromocytoma, thyroid storm, hyperthyroidism, primary hyperparathyroidism, and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).

Thyroid storm and hyperthyroidism could account for her thin appearance, anxiety, thyromegaly, and tremors. However, her symptoms of bone pain and hypercalcemia, along with elevated parathormone levels, suggest primary hyperparathyroidism. But one disease that could explain all these findings is Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 2. MEN2 is a genetic disorder that leads to the development of multiple tumors in various endocrine glands. In MEN2, there are commonly pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas (which secrete calcitonin), and hyperparathyroidism. This would also explain the elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines (pheochromocytoma), calcitonin (medullary thyroid carcinoma), and parathormone levels (hyperparathyroidism).

The patient also has diffuse thyroid swelling with elevated serum calcitonin, suggesting medullary thyroid cancer. Furthermore, the presence of elevated serum parathormone and hypercalcemia suggests hyperparathyroidism. These three conditions together (pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and hyperparathyroidism) are indicative of a condition called Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), a rare inherited disorder that leads to the growth of tumors in different endocrine glands. The patient's elevated epinephrine levels and hyperglycemia are also in line with the presence of pheochromocytoma, one of the components of MEN 2.",Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2,N,"This patient's presentation suggests multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A). The elevated 24-hour urinary vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and metanephrines, along with the symptoms of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis, point to a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes catecholamines. Additionally, the patient's hypercalcemia, elevated parathyroid hormone, and bone pain suggest hyperparathyroidism. The diffuse and firm thyromegaly with the patient's symptoms of weight loss, anxiety, and fine tremors suggest medullary thyroid carcinoma, which can secrete calcitonin and cause symptoms similar to hyperthyroidism. MEN 2A is characterized by the combination of pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, and parathyroid disease. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms and lab findings, MEN 2A is the most likely diagnosis.",Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2A,Y,"The prior probability of Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) could be quite low in the general population. However, this patient's presentation of headache, palpitations, episodic diaphoresis, hypertension, thyroid swelling, and bone pain is concerning for multiple endocrine pathologies, thereby increasing the probability of MEN2.

MEN2 is characterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. The diffuse and firm thyromegaly in this patient could be due to medullary thyroid carcinoma, increasing the posterior probability to around 20%.

The symptoms of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, along with the lab finding of elevated urinary VMA and metanephrines, are suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor that often causes episodic symptoms, significantly raising the posterior probability to 60%.

The presence of hypercalcemia along with an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level suggests primary hyperparathyroidism, which raises the posterior probability of MEN2 even further, possibly up to around 90%.

The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image.

This strongly suggests a diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, which is endemic in Africa and commonly presents as a jaw mass in children. Burkitt's lymphoma is associated with the Epstein-Barr virus, so this is the microorganism most likely associated with his condition.",Epstein-Barr virus,Y,"The rationale for this case begins with a differential diagnosis that could explain the symptoms and signs observed. The primary considerations for a swelling of the jaw in a child could include bacterial infection (like actinomyces), tuberculosis, a neoplastic process (like osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma), Burkitt lymphoma, or a fungal infection (like histoplasmosis).

However, in this case, the patient's history of immigration from Nigeria, unresponsiveness to antibiotic treatment, and the clinical picture of a prominent, firm, immobile mass that has distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek strongly suggest Burkitt lymphoma, which is endemic in certain parts of Africa, including Nigeria.

Burkitt lymphoma typically presents as a rapidly enlarging mass, often involving the jaw or abdomen. It is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a microorganism that has been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.

Therefore, given the patient's demographic background, presentation, and lack of response to antibiotics, Epstein-Barr virus would be the most likely associated microorganism in this case.",Epstein-Barr virus,Y,"This patient presents with a long-standing, poorly responsive jaw mass that has distorted local anatomy. The lack of systemic symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, night sweats) argues against an acute infectious process. Instead, this clinical presentation along with the recent immigration from Nigeria raises suspicion for a chronic granulomatous disease process, such as actinomycosis or tuberculosis. However, without having an image for histopathologic analysis, it is hard to definitively identify the microorganism involved. If the image revealed sulfur granules, the microorganism would likely be Actinomyces israelii, a common cause of cervicofacial actinomycosis. On the other hand, if the image showed caseating granulomas, the microorganism would be Mycobacterium tuberculosis, consistent with scrofula or tuberculous lymphadenitis.",Cannot determine without image,N,"Without the image or a more detailed description of the biopsy results, it's difficult to deduce the specific pathogen involved. However, the clinical presentation seems to suggest a chronic, unresponsive infection that causes bony destruction and inflammation, which is suggestive of a granulomatous disease. In the context of immigration from a region like Nigeria, where tuberculosis is endemic, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a potential suspect. Another possibility could be Actinomyces israelii, which can cause cervicofacial actinomycosis characterized by chronic and indurated jaw swelling. However, without the image or a description of the histopathologic analysis, this remains speculative.",Inconclusive without image,N,"To answer this question accurately, I'd need to see the mentioned image showing the histopathologic analysis, which will guide our inference about the causative organism.

However, given the information in the question, we can make a Bayesian inference with the provided details. Based on the endemic location (Nigeria), the chronic, non-resolving nature of the mass, and the antibiotic resistance, mycobacterial infection (like Mycobacterium tuberculosis or non-tuberculous mycobacteria) could be considered.

Rationale:
Let's suppose the prior probability of a Mycobacterium infection in a case of an unresolving jaw mass is 5%. Given that the patient has come from Nigeria, where TB and other mycobacterial infections are common, we can increase the posterior probability to 20%. The antibiotic resistance would further increase this to 40%, as Mycobacterium species are often resistant to many conventional antibiotics. The chronic, non-resolving nature of the mass would further increase this probability to 60%. Therefore, we can reasonably infer that a Mycobacterium species may be responsible for this patient's condition.",Mycobacterium species,N

What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?""",Mesothelioma,Tuberculosis,N,Tuberculosis,N,Tuberculosis,N,Tuberculosis,N,Tuberculosis,N,,"The patient has a history of long-term smoking and employment in a textile factory, both of which are risk factors for lung diseases, including cancer. She is presenting with fatigue, weight loss, a non-productive cough, and shortness of breath, all symptoms that could be indicative of lung cancer. The chest x-ray shows nodular pleural lesions and a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the right side, further supporting the suspicion of a malignant process. The findings from the thoracentesis - turbid fluid, low glucose, relatively high lactate dehydrogenase, and moderate protein - are typical of exudative effusions, which can be caused by malignancy. Taken together, these clinical features strongly suggest a malignancy, likely lung cancer, as the underlying cause of her effusion.",Lung Cancer,Y,"The differential for this patient includes congestive heart failure, lung cancer, tuberculosis, and mesothelioma. Given the patient's long history of smoking and working in a textile factory (which potentially exposes her to asbestos), lung cancer and mesothelioma are top considerations. Furthermore, her recent travel to India also raises the possibility of tuberculosis.

The patient's pleural fluid analysis is indicative of an exudative effusion (based on Light's criteria: pleural fluid LDH >2/3 the upper limit of normal serum LDH, or pleural fluid protein >0.5 the serum protein), which points towards a pathology involving the lung parenchyma or the pleura itself rather than systemic conditions like congestive heart failure.

Among the exudative causes, tuberculosis usually presents with lymphocytic exudates and a much lower glucose level (<30 mg/dL) than our patient has. Congestive heart failure, on the other hand, typically presents with a transudative effusion, and this patient's symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis.

The presence of nodular pleural lesions on the chest x-ray, weight loss, non-productive cough, and fatigue are all concerning for malignancy. Given her significant smoking history and textile exposure, mesothelioma, a tumor of the pleura often associated with asbestos exposure, is a strong possibility. Lung cancer could also present similarly, but mesothelioma is more strongly associated with the pleural findings noted here.",Mesothelioma,Y,"This patient has a long history of cigarette smoking and work in a textile factory, which are risk factors for both lung cancer and mesothelioma, respectively. Her clinical features of cough, fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath, as well as the chest x-ray findings of nodular pleural lesions and a moderate-sized pleural effusion, all point to malignancy. The pleural fluid analysis showing low glucose, high lactate dehydrogenase, and high protein is also suggestive of an exudative process, which is more common in malignancies. Therefore, considering the risk factors and clinical presentation, the most likely cause of this patient's effusion is malignancy.",Malignancy,Y,"This patient's presentation of a non-productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, shortness of breath, and pleural effusion are suggestive of malignancy, particularly given her history of prolonged smoking and work in a textile factory, which raises the risk for lung cancer and mesothelioma. The dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base indicate fluid accumulation, and the chest x-ray findings further point to a pleural effusion with nodular pleural lesions, which are often associated with malignancies. The pleural fluid analysis shows signs of an exudative effusion (LDH more than 2/3 the upper limit of normal serum LDH, protein more than 0.5 the serum protein, or glucose less than 60 mg/dL), which is typically seen in conditions such as malignancy, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. However, the lack of a significant leukocyte count makes infection less likely. Considering her specific occupational and smoking history, and the presence of nodular pleural lesions on chest x-ray, the most likely underlying cause of the patient's effusion is malignant pleural mesothelioma.",Malignant pleural mesothelioma,Y,"To answer this question, we first consider the prior probabilities of different diseases that could cause a pleural effusion, including lung cancer, heart failure, tuberculosis, and other infections.

Starting with lung cancer: the patient has several risk factors that increase the prior probability. These include her long history of smoking (47 years, one pack daily), her advanced age, her occupational exposure as a seamstress in a textile factory (which can include exposure to asbestos, increasing risk of mesothelioma), and her recent weight loss. Therefore, we could reasonably set the prior probability of lung cancer at around 60%.

The next step is to update this probability given the results from the thoracentesis and chest x-ray. The x-ray showed nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion, which is consistent with a malignancy such as lung cancer. The pleural fluid analysis shows relatively high protein (3.8 g/dL) and lactate dehydrogenase (248 U/L), as well as relatively low glucose (59 mg/dl). These findings suggest an exudative effusion, which is more common in malignancies and infections rather than heart failure or other non-inflammatory conditions. The relatively low leukocyte count (4,000/mm3) decreases the likelihood of an infection, including tuberculosis (especially considering the patient's travel history to India). These findings can increase the posterior probability of lung cancer to around 80%.

Lastly, the patient's symptoms such as non-productive cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath are also consistent with lung cancer, as is her noted physical appearance of being thin (potentially indicating cachexia associated with cancer). These factors can further increase the posterior probability of lung cancer to around 85-90%.",Lung Cancer,Y
"A 66-year-old man with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes presents to the clinic with elevated liver function tests from baseline. He has a blood pressure of 136/92 mm Hg and a heart rate of 69/min. On physical examination, his heart sounds are regular and lung sounds are clear. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, fenofibrate, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril. Of these medications, which could contribute to the patient’s transaminitis?",Simvastatin,"Simvastatin, fenofibrate, and lisinopril.",Y,"Simvastatin, fenofibrate, and hydrochlorothiazide.",Y,"Simvastatin, fenofibrate, lisinopril",Y,Simvastatin and fenofibrate,Y,Simvastatin,Y,,"The patient's liver function tests are elevated from the baseline, suggesting a hepatotoxic effect. Among his medications, simvastatin and fenofibrate are known to potentially cause hepatotoxicity. Both these drugs are used to manage his high cholesterol. Simvastatin, a statin, is well known to cause elevated liver enzymes and, rarely, severe liver injury. Fenofibrate, a fibrate, also can cause a rise in liver enzymes and hepatotoxicity. Therefore, these two drugs may be contributing to the patient's elevated liver function tests.","Simvastatin, Fenofibrate",Y,"The differential diagnosis for transaminitis, or elevated liver enzymes, in this patient includes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol-induced liver injury, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune hepatitis among other causes.

Given the information provided, it's unlikely this patient has viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis as there's no mention of symptoms suggesting these conditions. Similarly, there's no information on alcohol use, so we can't definitively determine alcohol-induced liver injury. NAFLD could be a possibility due to the patient's metabolic syndrome, however, we are specifically asked about the patient's medication.

Now focusing on the medication list, we need to consider if any of these drugs are known to cause hepatotoxicity. Simvastatin and fenofibrate, both lipid-lowering agents, have been associated with transaminitis. They can potentially lead to drug-induced liver injury which is one of the common causes of elevated liver function tests. Similarly, metformin, a medication for diabetes, has been reported to cause liver injury, but it's rare. The other medications (hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril) are less likely to cause liver injury.

In this context, with a patient on multiple drugs, the challenge is to identify which drug is the offending agent. However, simvastatin and fenofibrate are more commonly associated with hepatotoxicity compared to the other medications.","Simvastatin, Fenofibrate",Y,"This patient's elevation in liver function tests could be caused by one of his medications. Both statins (simvastatin) and fibrates (fenofibrate) can potentially cause liver injury, manifesting as an asymptomatic increase in liver enzymes, or transaminitis. Simvastatin, in particular, is a commonly used statin associated with a mild elevation in aminotransferase levels that usually resolves even with continued therapy. More serious liver injury with these drugs is rare but possible. Given the patient's current medication regimen, simvastatin and fenofibrate are the most likely causes of his transaminitis.","Simvastatin, Fenofibrate",Y,"Transaminitis, or elevated liver function tests, can be caused by various medications. Among the drugs listed, simvastatin, a statin, is known to potentially cause hepatotoxicity. Statins, used for lowering cholesterol, can sometimes lead to abnormal liver enzyme levels. Although this side effect is relatively rare, it can occur. It's important to monitor liver enzyme levels when a patient is on this type of medication. Similarly, fenofibrate, a fibrate also used to control cholesterol levels, has been associated with potential liver damage. Given this patient's history of high cholesterol and the associated treatments, it's plausible that these two medications may contribute to his transaminitis.","Simvastatin, Fenofibrate",Y,"This is a classic Bayesian inference problem where we are given a prior (baseline) information about the patient's medication and we are asked to update our beliefs (probabilities) based on new evidence (the patient has elevated liver function tests).

Prior probabilities: The patient is taking several medications, all of which have a certain probability of causing transaminitis. Without considering the specific patient case, the probabilities of causing transaminitis for each drug are as follows: simvastatin (5%), metformin (1%), fenofibrate (2%), hydrochlorothiazide (1%), aspirin (1%), glyburide (1%), and lisinopril (1%).

Likelihood of new evidence: The patient has elevated liver function tests. This evidence can be interpreted as an increase in the probability of certain drugs causing transaminitis. The degree to which this evidence affects the probabilities depends on the known side effects of each drug. Simvastatin and fenofibrate are both known to potentially cause transaminitis. Given the new evidence, the probabilities for these two drugs could increase to: simvastatin (10%) and fenofibrate (5%).

Posterior probabilities: These are calculated by combining the prior probabilities and the likelihood of the new evidence. This is usually done by multiplying the two, but in this case, we can compare the updated probabilities to identify the most likely cause of the patient's transaminitis. Based on the updated probabilities, simvastatin has the highest probability (10%).",Simvastatin,Y

These clinical features are typical for a condition called lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory dermatosis that affects the anogenital region in postmenopausal women.",Lichen Sclerosus,Y,"This patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest a few possible diagnoses: lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, atrophic vaginitis, and vulvar cancer.

Lichen sclerosus and lichen planus both present with itching and changes in the appearance of the vulva, including white patches and thin skin. However, lichen planus usually involves redness and inflammation, which is not described in this case.

Atrophic vaginitis is commonly seen in postmenopausal women due to a decrease in estrogen levels, leading to thinning and drying of the vaginal tissues. Symptoms include itching, burning, and discomfort during sex, similar to this patient's symptoms.

Vulvar cancer can also present with vulvar itching and changes in the color or texture of the vulvar skin, but it would typically also involve a lump or ulcer, which is not mentioned in this case.

The severe vulvar itching, along with the appearance of the skin (dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions) and atrophy of the labia minora, the retracted clitoris, and the pale and wrinkled perianal skin, are most consistent with lichen sclerosus.",Lichen sclerosus,Y,"This patient's symptoms of severe vulvar itching, severe pain during intercourse, and physical examination findings of dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora are characteristic of Lichen sclerosus.

The failure to achieve symptom relief with lubricants suggests that the issue is not merely due to vaginal dryness or atrophic vaginitis, increasing the posterior probability to 45%.

His pulse is 95/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3.

The most notable part of his blood results is a Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) of 68 fL, which is considered low, suggesting microcytic anemia. The most common causes of microcytic anemia include iron deficiency anemia and anemia of chronic disease (now more commonly referred to as anemia of inflammation). Given the patient's history of noticing blood in his stools on three separate occasions, this points towards gastrointestinal bleeding as the source of blood loss. Chronic blood loss, especially from the gastrointestinal tract, can lead to iron deficiency anemia because iron is lost along with the blood cells. Furthermore, this patient has end-stage renal disease which could be contributing to his anemia via reduced erythropoietin production, however this would typically lead to a normocytic anemia. Therefore, the presence of microcytic anemia along with gastrointestinal bleeding suggests that the most likely cause of this patient's bleeding is a gastrointestinal source leading to iron deficiency anemia.",Gastrointestinal bleeding,Y,"The differential for this patient's bleeding includes gastric ulcer, colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, hemorrhoids, anal fissure, and esophageal varices. Given the patient's age, history of alcohol use, and the presence of anemia with a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), there is a high suspicion for gastrointestinal bleeding. His anemia is microcytic (MCV < 80 fL), which is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, commonly caused by chronic gastrointestinal blood loss.

Now let's narrow it down:

Gastric ulcers and esophageal varices are more associated with alcohol abuse, but they usually present with acute upper GI bleeding (e.g., hematemesis, melena), not occult blood loss.
Hemorrhoids and anal fissures would likely be detected on rectal exam, which is unremarkable in this case.
Colorectal cancer typically presents with a change in bowel habits, and although possible, there is no mention of this in the patient's history.
Angiodysplasia is associated with chronic kidney disease (which the patient has), and often results in intermittent bleeding and iron deficiency anemia.
Diverticular disease is another possibility given the patient's age, but it tends to cause bright red bleeding per rectum which is not reported here.
Based on the above, the most likely cause of this patient's anemia and gastrointestinal blood loss is angiodysplasia.",Angiodysplasia,Y,"This patient has several symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations on exertion, and pale conjunctivae which are common symptoms of anemia. The patient also has a low hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), confirming a picture of microcytic anemia. One of the most common causes of microcytic anemia is iron deficiency, often due to chronic blood loss. The fact that this patient has noticed blood in his stools on multiple occasions over the past few months strongly suggests gastrointestinal bleeding as the likely cause of his anemia. This could be from a variety of sources such as peptic ulcer disease, malignancy, or angiodysplasia, but given the patient's age, malignancy would be a key concern.",Gastrointestinal bleeding,Y,"This patient's presentation with microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume of 68 �m_, where the normal range is 80-96 �m_), fatigue, shortness of breath, and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (blood in stools) is suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia often presents with a microcytic, hypochromic anemia, and common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and pallor. Chronic gastrointestinal blood loss is one of the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia in adult males. Therefore, it is likely that the source of this patient's iron deficiency and thus anemia is chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, potentially due to conditions such as peptic ulcer disease or colon cancer.",Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding,Y,"The prior probability of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding as the cause of this patient's bleeding, given his symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations, is significant.

The finding of pale conjunctivae, suggesting anemia, further increases the probability to 75%. The presentation of a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) suggests that this anemia is of the microcytic variety, which is often associated with chronic blood loss, usually from the GI tract, so the probability rises to 85%. This patient likely has a GI source of blood loss.",Gastrointestinal bleeding,Y
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness.

She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block.

The episode was short and recovery was rapid and complete, with immediate return of normal cognitive function. She has no significant medical history, and is otherwise healthy. Additionally, she was under stress due to her work. This is characteristic of a vasovagal syncope, which is a common cause of fainting. Vasovagal syncope is often triggered by pain or emotional stress and can be associated with prodromal symptoms such as nausea, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, pallor, and visual changes. The patient's ECG showing an incomplete right bundle branch block is likely incidental and does not explain the patient's symptoms.",Vasovagal syncope,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes seizure disorders (such as epilepsy), syncopal episodes (like vasovagal syncope), cardiac arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, or panic attack. Given the context that the patient was in a potentially stressful or anxiety-provoking situation (being tattooed) when she developed symptoms of diaphoresis and pallor followed by loss of consciousness, this scenario is suggestive of a vasovagal syncope. Seizures are usually associated with a postictal state, which includes confusion and drowsiness after the seizure episode, but this patient was alert and fully oriented immediately after the event, which is more indicative of a syncope. Cardiac arrhythmias are less likely given the incomplete right bundle branch block on ECG, which is often a normal variant and not typically associated with syncope. Hypoglycemia would typically cause more prolonged symptoms and is less likely without a history of diabetes or other metabolic disorder. Panic attacks usually don't lead to loss of consciousness. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a vasovagal syncope.",Vasovagal syncope,Y,"This young woman experienced a transient loss of consciousness (syncope) accompanied by jerky movements of the limbs. This event was preceded by symptoms suggestive of autonomic activation (i.e., pallor and diaphoresis). The rapid return to baseline neurological function after the event also suggests syncope, as seizures (which could also cause transient loss of consciousness and convulsive activity) are typically followed by a postictal period of confusion. The absence of other neurological signs or symptoms and the normal neurological examination further support the diagnosis of syncope. Her episode occurred during a stressful event, and emotional stress is a well-known precipitant of vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope, the most common type of syncope. This is often triggered by emotional stress or pain, which seems probable given the fact that she was being tattooed. Therefore, her symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of vasovagal syncope.",Vasovagal syncope,Y,"This patient experienced a syncopal event with specific characteristics suggesting a vasovagal syncope. She was seated and under possible stress due to her job, which could have led to a significant emotional or physical trigger. The diaphoresis and paleness are indicative of a vagal response preceding the event. The brief, generalized, jerky movement of the limbs is consistent with convulsive syncope, which can sometimes occur due to cerebral hypoperfusion and does not necessarily indicate a seizure disorder. Her quick recovery and lack of post-ictal confusion or drowsiness also favor syncope over seizure. Additionally, incomplete right bundle branch block found on her ECG is a common finding in healthy young adults and is likely incidental. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is vasovagal syncope.",Vasovagal syncope,Y,"The prior probability of a Vasovagal Syncope (also known as neurocardiogenic syncope or reflex syncope) in a young, healthy individual like this patient is about 35%. The symptoms occurred in a setting of emotional distress (getting a tattoo and high stress at work), which increases the likelihood of a vasovagal syncope to about 50%. The patient experienced a short loss of consciousness followed by a quick and complete recovery, which is typical of vasovagal syncope, raising the posterior probability to 70%. The absence of abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary and neurological examination further strengthens the probability of vasovagal syncope to about 85%.

Her symptoms, coupled with jaundice and findings of fragmented erythrocytes and ring-shaped inclusions in erythrocytes on blood smear, are highly suggestive of malaria. The ring-shaped inclusions are likely to be trophozoites, a stage in the life cycle of Plasmodium species, which cause malaria. Despite taking chloroquine as prophylaxis, it is important to note that some Plasmodium species, such as Plasmodium falciparum, are resistant to chloroquine, especially in certain geographical areas including India. Therefore, the most likely cause of infection in this patient is malaria, most likely due to a chloroquine-resistant strain such as Plasmodium falciparum.",Chloroquine-resistant malaria,Y,"The differential for this patient includes malaria, dengue fever, typhoid fever, and leptospirosis. However, the key to this case is the travel history and the specific findings on blood smear. Malaria is endemic in India and the finding of ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes is classic for a Plasmodium infection, the parasite responsible for malaria. While she did take chloroquine, there are forms of malaria that are resistant to this medication, and she might have also not complied fully with the medication regimen. Jaundice and a decreased hemoglobin concentration could also be seen in malaria due to hemolysis of infected red blood cells. The other diagnoses in the differential would not typically present with these specific blood smear findings. Therefore, the most likely cause of the infection in this patient is malaria.",Malaria,Y,"The patient recently returned from India and has fever, headache, muscle pain, jaundice, and a blood smear with ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. These symptoms and the findings on her blood smear are suggestive of malaria. In particular, the presence of the ring-shaped inclusion bodies is characteristic of Plasmodium falciparum, the species of malaria that is most common and most deadly. Moreover, chloroquine resistance is common among Plasmodium falciparum in certain areas, including India. This suggests that the prophylactic chloroquine she took may not have been effective.",Plasmodium falciparum,Y,"The patient's travel history to India, high-grade fever, headache, muscle pain, jaundice, and the presence of ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes on blood smear are all indicative of malaria. Malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, and is prevalent in many parts of India. Chloroquine is a medication used for malaria prophylaxis, but its effectiveness can vary depending on the region and the presence of drug-resistant strains. The presence of fragmented erythrocytes suggests possible hemolytic anemia, which can occur in severe malaria due to the rupture of infected erythrocytes. Therefore, the most likely cause of infection in this patient is malaria, most likely due to Plasmodium falciparum, which is known to cause the ring-shaped inclusion bodies seen on the smear.",Malaria,Y,"The prior probability of Malaria is already high given the patient's recent travel to India, a region where Malaria is endemic. We could estimate this at around 30%. The patient did take chloroquine, which should reduce the risk, but we don't know the exact adherence to prophylaxis protocol, and chloroquine resistance is also a known issue, particularly in India, which could affect the effectiveness of the drug.

The patient's presentation of high-grade fever, headache, and muscle pain can be associated with various conditions but are certainly compatible with Malaria, perhaps bringing our estimate up to 40%. The observed jaundice indicates some form of liver involvement, which is also consistent with a Malaria infection, especially in severe cases, raising the probability further to about 50%.

The definitive clue here comes from the blood smear results. Fragmented erythrocytes and occasional ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes are characteristic findings in Malaria. This should greatly increase the probability of Malaria, to, say, around 95%. Given the symptoms, the patient's travel history, and most importantly the characteristic findings in the blood smear, the patient's infection is most likely caused by Malaria.",Malaria,Y

This protozoan infection can persist for weeks to months without treatment and can cause a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic to severe dysentery and weight loss.",Amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica infection),N,"This patient's symptoms are suggestive of an infection with the protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica. Considering the prior probability of amebiasis in general population is low, let's say around 1% but factoring in the information provided:

She recently returned from Costa Rica, a country where this infection is more common. This increases our posterior probability to let's say around 15%.

Her symptom of persistent diarrhea with a significant number of stools per day is suggestive of an enteric infection, further increasing the probability to around 40%.

Additionally, the colonoscopy findings of dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots is indicative of the characteristic 'flask-shaped' ulcers in amebic colitis, raising the posterior probability to around 80%.

Given the combination of her symptoms, travel history, and colonoscopy findings, an infection with Entamoeba histolytica is the most likely cause of her symptoms.",Amebiasis (Entamoeba histolytica infection),N
"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Schizotypal personality disorder,Schizophrenia,N,Schizophrenia,N,Schizophrenia,N,Delusional disorder,N,Schizophrenia,N,,"This patient has been exhibiting a persistent pattern of social withdrawal, eccentric behavior, and peculiar beliefs, which started during adolescence and has lasted for over a year, which is suggestive of a personality disorder. He does not have hallucinations or delusions, which rules out schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. His preoccupation with peculiar beliefs (e.g., ""breath of a demon"" being the cause of a breeze in a room), social withdrawal, and eccentric behavior, as well as his emotional coldness (evident from his laborious speech and lack of eye contact) fit the criteria for Schizotypal Personality Disorder, which is a Cluster A personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5).",Schizotypal Personality Disorder,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: Schizophrenia, Social Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Schizotypal Personality Disorder, and Autism Spectrum Disorder.
Schizophrenia usually presents with positive symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), negative symptoms (e.g., apathy, lack of emotion, poor or nonexistent social functioning), and cognitive symptoms (e.g., disorganized thoughts, difficulty concentrating and/or following instructions, difficulty completing tasks, memory problems). However, the patient does not have hallucinations, disorganized thought or behavior which makes schizophrenia less likely.
Social Anxiety Disorder is characterized by a significant amount of fear, embarrassment, or humiliation in social performance-based situations, to a point where these situations are avoided or endured with a significant amount of distress. The patient's anxiety around others and avoidance of social situations could suggest this diagnosis, however, his belief in paranormal phenomena and ""signs of their presence"" suggests a thought disorder.
Major depressive disorder is characterized by a persistent and pervasive low mood that is accompanied by low self-esteem and by a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities. This patient does not display low mood, low self-esteem, or anhedonia, making this less likely.
Autism Spectrum Disorder is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts. The patient does show some features of ASD like avoidance of eye contact, social isolation, and special interests but the onset in late teens and lack of any note about developmental delays or childhood behaviors does not support this diagnosis.
Schizotypal Personality Disorder is characterized by severe social anxiety, thought disorder, paranoid ideation, derealization, transient psychosis, and often unconventional beliefs. The patient has severe social anxiety, unconventional beliefs (paranormal phenomena and signs of demon presence), and thought disorder (evidenced by his beliefs), making Schizotypal Personality Disorder the most likely diagnosis.",Schizotypal Personality Disorder,Y,"This young man's presentation is consistent with Schizotypal Personality Disorder. This disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of social and interpersonal deficits, including reduced capacity for close relationships. Additionally, these individuals often have cognitive or perceptual distortions and eccentric behavior. Their speech can be vague, overelaborate, or stereotyped. They often have odd beliefs or engage in magical thinking, as demonstrated by the patient's belief in the ""breath of a demon."" Symptoms typically begin in early adulthood, as seen in this case.",Schizotypal Personality Disorder,Y,"This patient has a history of poor social interactions, unusual interests (paranormal phenomena), and the belief in occurrences that are not based on reality (e.g., the ""breath of a demon""). His mother reports difficulties fitting in and lack of friends, which suggests impaired social interactions. He also shows signs of paranoia and social anxiety. His preoccupation with unusual topics and beliefs in unprovable phenomena are in line with delusional disorders. The avoidance of eye contact and laborious speech may also suggest difficulties in social communication. However, considering that these symptoms have been present for over 3 years (since his mid to late teens), a diagnosis of schizophrenia would be less likely given that it typically presents with more severe symptoms such as hallucinations and disorganized speech. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with schizotypal personality disorder, which is characterized by social anxiety, eccentric behavior, suspicious or paranoid ideation, and often, odd beliefs leading to interpersonal difficulty.",Schizotypal personality disorder,Y,"The prior probability for a diagnosis of schizophrenia is 1.1% (as per lifetime prevalence estimates). The patient's unusual interest in paranormal phenomena and signs of their presence, like a breeze in an enclosed room being the ""breath of a demon"", increases the probability of delusional disorder to 15%. The patient's tendency to dress in black and wear a long coat even during summer, his social difficulties and isolation, as well as his preference for solitary activities (like playing online games), further increases the probability of a schizotypal personality disorder to 40%. However, he has been exhibiting these symptoms over the past 3 years, and his symptoms significantly impact his academic and social life. This pushes the probability of a diagnosis of schizophrenia higher, to about 60%. The lack of overt hallucinations or disorganized behavior does temper this probability, but the overall pattern of chronic social impairment and eccentric behavior with delusional ideation suggests schizophrenia as the most likely diagnosis.",Schizophrenia,N
"A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of diplopia and ocular pain when reading the newspaper. She also has a 3-month history of amenorrhea, hot flashes, and increased sweating. She reports that she has been overweight all her adult life and is happy to have lost 6.8-kg (15-lb) of weight in the past 2 months. Her pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 148/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist palms and a nontender thyroid gland that is enlarged to two times its normal size. Ophthalmologic examination shows prominence of the globes of the eyes, bilateral lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and an inability to converge the eyes. There is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles. Visual acuity is 20/20 bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows a fine resting tremor of the hands.

These signs and symptoms are indicative of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that results in hyperthyroidism and is often associated with ophthalmopathy. The hyperthyroid state can explain her weight loss, increased sweating, tachycardia, hypertension, and tremor. The symptoms of Graves' ophthalmopathy include pain, redness, diplopia, and lid retraction, which are present in this patient. Her ocular complaints are most likely a result of this condition.",Graves' Ophthalmopathy,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease), primary amenorrhea due to other causes, menopause, pituitary adenoma, and other thyroid disorders.

The patient's symptoms of weight loss, increased sweating, moist palms, tachycardia, hypertension, and enlarged thyroid gland strongly suggest hyperthyroidism. Additionally, her symptoms of diplopia, ocular pain, and prominent globes are suggestive of Graves' ophthalmopathy, a common extrathyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease. The fact that there is no pain on movement of the extraocular muscles, yet an inability to converge the eyes, further supports this. The presence of amenorrhea and hot flashes could be misinterpreted as menopause; however, these can also occur in cases of severe hyperthyroidism due to changes in the hormonal balance. The fine resting tremor and deep tendon reflexes with a shortened relaxation phase are additional manifestations of hyperthyroidism.",Graves' disease,Y,"The constellation of symptoms including diplopia (double vision), ocular pain, weight loss, increased sweating, increased heart rate, high blood pressure, an enlarged thyroid gland, prominence of the eyes (exophthalmos), fine tremors, and shortened relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes strongly suggest hyperthyroidism. This is a condition caused by an overactive thyroid gland producing excessive thyroid hormones. In particular, the eye findings can be a result of Graves' ophthalmopathy, a condition commonly associated with Graves' disease, an autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism. The ocular manifestations occur due to the inflammation and swelling of the muscles and tissues around the eyes, leading to the characteristic features seen in this patient.",Graves' ophthalmopathy,Y,"This patient presents with classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including weight loss, tachycardia, hypertension, fine resting tremor, and shortened relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. The presence of an enlarged thyroid gland also supports this diagnosis. The ocular signs of lid retraction, conjunctival injection, and inability to converge the eyes, along with no pain on movement of extraocular muscles, are suggestive of Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is associated with Graves' disease - an autoimmune condition that is a common cause of hyperthyroidism.

The distant heart sounds might be related to hyperinflated lungs, a common physical finding in COPD due to air trapping.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease caused by her history of heavy smoking.",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Y,"The differential for this patient includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, and heart failure. Given her long history of smoking, chronic bronchitis and emphysema (both components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD) are high on the list. Chronic bronchitis is associated with a productive cough, which she has, particularly in the morning. Emphysema typically presents with dyspnea on exertion and distant heart sounds due to hyperinflation of the lungs, both of which this patient has. Asthma typically presents in younger individuals and is associated with a reversible obstruction, and lung cancer would typically present with more severe symptoms such as weight loss and hemoptysis which she does not report. Pulmonary hypertension and heart failure are less likely given the lack of associated symptoms such as peripheral edema and the absence of heart murmurs, gallops, or rubs on examination.

The distant heart sounds can be a result of hyperinflation of the lungs, which is a common feature of emphysema, a component of COPD. Additionally, the wheezing and rhonchi heard on auscultation further point towards obstructive airway disease. The chronicity of her symptoms (2 years) also fits with the slowly progressive course of COPD.",Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,Y,"This patient's 40-year history of smoking, chronic cough productive of phlegm, fatigue, and exertional dyspnea are suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), particularly chronic bronchitis, which is defined by a productive cough for three months in two consecutive years.

Physical exam findings like scattered wheezing and rhonchi throughout both lung fields, which are common in COPD, can further raise the probability to 90%. Distant heart sounds might suggest a hyperinflated thorax, again pointing towards COPD, increasing the probability to perhaps 95%.

Precocious puberty can be central (where the issue is in the brain, typically the pituitary gland) or peripheral (where the issue lies in the gonads or adrenal glands). In this case, she has a pelvic ultrasound showing an ovarian mass, which indicates that the source of her symptoms is likely peripheral and caused by the mass producing estrogen, leading to the precocious puberty. Therefore, this patient most likely has an estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor.",Estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: precocious puberty, adrenal tumor, ovarian tumor, or hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) dysfunction. The patient's excessive hair growth and advanced Tanner stage at a young age suggest precocious puberty. However, the absence of a family history of precocious puberty makes a genetic cause less likely. The presence of an ovarian mass on ultrasound suggests that the precocious puberty could be secondary to this mass. The elevated estrogen level supports this, as ovarian tumors can often produce estrogen. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is an ovarian tumor causing precocious puberty.",Ovarian tumor,Y,"This child exhibits signs of precocious puberty, as indicated by the advanced Tanner stage development and the appearance of axillary and pubic hair, which is unusual for her age. Given the absence of family history of precocious puberty and the presence of an ovarian mass, it is highly probable that this puberty is peripheral (or gonadotropin-independent) in origin. The elevated estrogen level further supports this. Ovarian tumors, including granulosa cell tumors, can lead to the production of estrogen, which in turn can result in precocious puberty. Therefore, given these clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is an estrogen-secreting ovarian tumor, likely a granulosa cell tumor.",Granulosa cell tumor,Y,"The patient is experiencing precocious puberty, as evidenced by the presence of pubic and axillary hair, along with Tanner stage 4 development at an unusually young age. The presence of an ovarian mass in conjunction with elevated estrogen levels suggests that this puberty is being caused by the mass, which is likely producing excess estrogen. The most likely type of tumor in prepubertal girls is a granulosa cell tumor, which is known to secrete estrogen and cause isosexual precocity, which refers to the development of secondary sexual characteristics corresponding to the patient's sex.

Given the presentation and the findings of retinal abnormalities in the neonate, one possibility to consider is congenital rubella syndrome. This syndrome can result from maternal infection with the rubella virus, especially when it occurs early in pregnancy, as in this case. Congenital rubella syndrome can result in a number of abnormalities including hearing loss, vision problems, intellectual disabilities, growth retardation, and cardiac abnormalities. Among the potential cardiac defects, the most common one associated with congenital rubella syndrome is patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), but other defects like pulmonary artery stenosis and septal defects can also occur.",Patent Ductus Arteriosus,Y,"This infant's mother's symptoms of fever, rash, muscle pain, swollen and tender lymph nodes suggest infection during pregnancy. The differential for these maternal symptoms includes: rubella, toxoplasmosis, CMV, syphilis, and HIV (TORCH syndrome). However, the described retinal ""salt-and-pepper"" retinopathy is characteristic of congenital rubella. In addition to these findings, congenital rubella is also associated with heart defects, most commonly patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary artery stenosis.",Patent ductus arteriosus,Y,"Based on the provided information, it seems like the mother had a rubella infection during pregnancy, which is known to cause congenital rubella syndrome in the fetus. One of the classic findings in congenital rubella syndrome is ""salt and pepper"" retinopathy, which could be the unshown findings mentioned. One of the most common heart defects associated with congenital rubella syndrome is patent ductus arteriosus.

Rationale:
The mother's symptoms of a mild fever, rash, muscle pain, and tender lymph nodes during the second month of gestation suggest an infection with the Rubella virus. This infection, when it occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the newborn. Features of CRS can include cataracts, hearing loss, ""salt-and-pepper"" retinopathy, and various heart defects, among other complications. One of the most common cardiac anomalies seen in CRS is patent ductus arteriosus.",Patent Ductus Arteriosus,Y,"It seems there was a missing piece of information in the final question: the specific findings on retinal examination of the newborn. The retinal findings could imply congenital infections such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, or syphilis, which could be linked with the mother's symptoms during pregnancy. The heart defects associated with these infections will depend on the specific pathogen involved. If the symptoms point to congenital rubella, then patent ductus arteriosus or pulmonary artery stenosis are possible. Without this information, the rationale and the answer can't be accurately given.

However, given the information you provided, I will make an assumption and provide a possible answer:

Assuming the retinal findings suggest ""salt and pepper"" retinopathy and given the symptoms of the mother during the second month of gestation, the diagnosis would likely be congenital rubella syndrome. A congenital heart defect often associated with this condition is patent ductus arteriosus.

Rationale:
The mother's symptoms during pregnancy (fever, rash, muscle pain, swollen lymph nodes) align with the classic signs of a rubella infection. If contracted during pregnancy, rubella can cause a number of severe complications, including congenital rubella syndrome in the newborn. The retinal ""salt and pepper"" retinopathy is a classic ocular manifestation of congenital rubella syndrome. In terms of congenital heart defects, patent ductus arteriosus is the most common heart defect associated with congenital rubella syndrome.",Patent ductus arteriosus,Y,"I'm sorry, but without the described image or a description of the retinal findings, I can't proceed with a Bayesian inference. However, I can tell you that the mother's symptoms suggest a possible infection during pregnancy, potentially rubella, which is known to cause congenital rubella syndrome. This condition is associated with several congenital heart defects, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and pulmonary artery stenosis.

Let's suppose the image shows 'Salt and Pepper' retinopathy, a characteristic finding of congenital rubella syndrome. We would use this information to further refine our Bayesian inference as follows:

Rationale:
The prior probability of congenital rubella syndrome is relatively low in developed countries due to widespread vaccination, but for the sake of argument, let's say it's around 1%. The mother's symptoms of fever, rash, and tender lymph nodes during pregnancy suggest a viral infection, which increases the posterior probability of congenital rubella syndrome to 20%. The presence of 'Salt and Pepper' retinopathy in the neonate, a hallmark sign of congenital rubella syndrome, significantly increases the probability further to 80%. The presence of congenital heart defects in congenital rubella syndrome is relatively high, around 50%. Therefore, given all the information, it's highly likely the neonate may have a congenital heart defect related to congenital rubella syndrome.",Congenital Heart Defect,N

The valgus stress test places stress on the medial side of the knee, primarily testing the integrity of the medial collateral ligament (MCL). A positive test (increased laxity) compared to the other knee would suggest an injury to this structure.

He has a negative Lachman's test and posterior drawer test, which rules out injury to the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, respectively. However, the patient's right knee is more lax upon valgus stress test when compared to his left knee. The valgus stress test primarily checks for medial collateral ligament (MCL) integrity.

The absence of laxity on the Lachman's and posterior drawer tests, which test the integrity of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), respectively, indicates that these structures are likely intact. The absence of swelling or effusion also points against a meniscus injury or an injury to either of the cruciate ligaments, as these typically cause knee effusion. Therefore, based on these clinical findings, the patient likely has an injury to his MCL.",Medial collateral ligament (MCL),Y,"This patient's valgus stress test was positive, which indicates an injury to the structures that resist the valgus force, namely the medial collateral ligament (MCL).

The lack of laxity on the Lachman's and posterior drawer tests indicate that the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, respectively, are likely intact.

On speculum exam, a 1.4 cm, erythematous exophytic mass with ulceration is noted on the posterior wall of the upper third of the vagina. What is the most probable histopathology of this mass?",Squamous cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,,"The patient's history of smoking, HPV infection, and LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion) puts her at a high risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of vaginal cancer. Her presenting symptom of post-coital bleeding and the discovery of an exophytic mass with ulceration on the vaginal wall are characteristic of this type of cancer. The lack of follow-up care and continued risk factors such as smoking and untreated HPV infection likely contributed to the progression from CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) to invasive cancer.",Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,"The differential for a postmenopausal woman with post-coital bleeding and a mass on vaginal examination includes cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, vaginal cancer, and vulvar cancer. Given the location of the mass, in the upper third of the vagina, cervical or vaginal cancer is more likely. The history of LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), high-risk HPV (human papillomavirus) strains, and lack of follow-up screenings in the past 11 years increases the likelihood of cervical cancer. However, the description of the lesion as ""exophytic"" (protruding) and ""ulcerative"" suggests a more advanced disease state, and the direct visualisation of the lesion in the upper third of the vagina may suggest vaginal cancer instead. The patient's smoking history also contributes to the risk of developing either cervical or vaginal cancer. However, the history of HPV and lack of follow-up Pap smears are significant risk factors for cervical cancer specifically, and the disease can extend to the upper vagina, which may explain the lesion's location. Thus, the histopathology is most likely to be squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of cervical cancer, which is also common in vaginal cancer.",Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,"This patient has a significant risk factor for vaginal cancer, which is a positive history for high-risk HPV strains and a history of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL). Furthermore, she has a long history of smoking, another important risk factor for vaginal cancer. Additionally, her symptoms of post-coital bleeding and the physical examination finding of an erythematous, exophytic, ulcerated mass strongly suggest malignancy. Given her risk factors and clinical presentation, the most likely histopathological finding would be squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of vaginal cancer.",Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,"The patient in question has a significant risk profile for developing cervical cancer: a history of LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), positive high-risk HPV strains, smoking, and absence of follow-up Pap smears. The vaginal mass, with its specific characteristics, in this context, is highly suggestive of an invasive form of cervical cancer. The most common type of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, which can present with bloody post-coital vaginal discharge and a visible tumor mass, as in this case.",Squamous cell carcinoma,Y,"In order to address this question using a Bayesian inference, we first need to establish some prior probabilities based on the information given and the most likely conditions that could cause her symptoms. In this case, the most probable diagnoses would be cervical/vaginal cancer, polyps, or possibly cervical/vaginal infections.

The prior probability for cervical cancer in women who smoke and have high-risk HPV is approximately 10%. The patient's history of LSIL and positive high-risk HPV test significantly increases the likelihood of cervical cancer, raising the posterior probability to 40%. Her failure to attend follow-up Pap smears would have provided an opportunity for early detection and intervention, further increasing the probability to 60%. The presentation of an erythematous exophytic mass with ulceration in the vagina is highly suggestive of cancer, particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) due to the patient's smoking history and high-risk HPV status. This brings the final probability for SCC to around 80%.

Polyps or infections might still be possibilities, but the probabilities are significantly lower given the presenting signs and history. For example, a polyp could also cause bleeding but is less likely to present as an erythematous exophytic mass, so the probability remains relatively low at around 10%. Similarly, while infections can cause bleeding and some physical changes, they are less likely to result in an exophytic mass, keeping their probability also low at around 10%.

Therefore, based on the information given and the likelihoods deduced through Bayesian inference, the most probable histopathology of this mass is squamous cell carcinoma.",Squamous cell carcinoma,Y
"A 62-year-old woman has been receiving amoxicillin for acute sinusitis for 12 days. She develops a macular rash on her neck, back, and torso. The amoxicillin is therefore changed to cephalexin for an additional week. The rash resolves, but she returns complaining of fatigue, flank pain, and fever that has persisted despite the resolution of the sinusitis. She has a history of essential hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and gastric reflux. She has been on a stable regimen of lisinopril, simvastatin, and omeprazole. Today, her vital signs reveal: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure 145/90 mm Hg, regular pulse 75/min, and respirations 16/min. The physical examination is unremarkable. Serum urea and creatinine are elevated. Urinalysis shows leukocyturia, but urine bacterial culture is negative. A urine cytospin stained with Hansel’s solution reveals 3% binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute interstitial nephritis,Interstitial nephritis,Y,Interstitial nephritis,Y,Interstitial nephritis,Y,Interstitial nephritis,Y,Interstitial nephritis,Y,,"The patient was on amoxicillin, and then switched to cephalexin, both of which are types of antibiotics. She developed a rash while on amoxicillin, which resolved, but then developed fatigue, flank pain, and fever after switching to cephalexin. Additionally, her serum urea and creatinine are elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction. The presence of binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm in her urine, alongside leukocyturia, suggests an inflammatory response in the renal tubules. Taken together, these findings are characteristic of a drug-induced interstitial nephritis, a form of renal injury that can be caused by certain medications, including antibiotics like cephalosporins.",Drug-induced interstitial nephritis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient can include urinary tract infection (UTI), pyelonephritis, acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), glomerulonephritis, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Given her history, it seems unlikely that the patient has UTI or pyelonephritis, as the urine culture is negative for bacteria. Glomerulonephritis and ATN usually occur after a more significant event, such as severe infection, autoimmune disease, or significant kidney injury, which the patient's history does not suggest.

The patient's recent history of drug rash due to amoxicillin and the resolution of the rash after stopping the medication are suggestive of a drug-induced allergic reaction. Furthermore, the recent switch to another antibiotic (cephalexin), along with symptoms of fatigue, flank pain, fever, elevated serum urea and creatinine (indicating impaired renal function), and leukocyturia (white blood cells in the urine) - all align with a diagnosis of drug-induced Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN). This diagnosis is further supported by the urine cytospin showing binucleated cells with eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm - a finding consistent with AIN.

So, this patient most likely has Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN), likely drug-induced.",Acute Interstitial Nephritis,Y,"The patient had recently taken two different antibiotics, and now presents with fatigue, flank pain, fever, and laboratory findings including elevated serum urea and creatinine, leukocyturia, and eosinophilic, granular, binucleated cells in her urine. These findings suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), a condition often caused by medications such as antibiotics, especially penicillins and cephalosporins like amoxicillin and cephalexin. AIN usually presents with non-specific symptoms like fatigue, fever, and flank pain. Leukocyturia (white blood cells in the urine) is often present, but a negative urine bacterial culture indicates that this isn't due to a urinary tract infection. The presence of eosinophils in the urine (eosinophiluria) is particularly suggestive of AIN, although it's not always present. Binucleated cells can also be seen in AIN.",Acute Interstitial Nephritis,Y,"The patient's history of taking amoxicillin followed by cephalexin suggests a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction, which can lead to AIN. The initial macular rash on the neck, back, and torso could have been a manifestation of a drug allergy. The subsequent development of fatigue, flank pain, and fever, along with elevated serum urea and creatinine, suggests renal involvement. The presence of leukocyturia and eosinophilic granular cytoplasm in binucleated cells on urine cytospin staining further supports the diagnosis of AIN. AIN is characterized by interstitial inflammation and infiltration of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, in the renal interstitium.",Acute Interstitial Nephritis,Y,"The prior probability of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is 5%. The recent use of amoxicillin, which is known to be a cause of drug-induced AIN, increases the posterior probability of AIN to 20%. The patient's symptoms including fever, flank pain, and leukocyturia, which are common in AIN, further increase the posterior probability to 40%. The presence of eosinophiluria, identified by Hansel's staining, is a hallmark of AIN and brings the posterior probability up to 70%. The persistence of symptoms and negative urine culture after the resolution of sinusitis suggests a non-infectious cause, which supports AIN, bringing the posterior probability to 90%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is acute interstitial nephritis.",Acute interstitial nephritis,Y
"A 74-year-old female is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-week history of increasing weakness and chills. She also notes difficulty breathing for the last three days. Eight weeks ago, she underwent left hemicolectomy for adenocarcinoma of the colon. She subsequently developed a severe urinary tract infection, was treated in the intensive care unit for four days, and was discharged from the hospital three weeks ago. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis with lumbar pain, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years. She does not drink alcohol and has never used illicit drugs. Current medications include warfarin, metformin, lisinopril, and aspirin. She appears lethargic and has a large conjunctival hemorrhage in her left eye. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 126/79 mm Hg. Cardiac auscultation reveals a new holosystolic murmur over the apex. Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the upper quadrants and a well-healed 12-cm paramedian scar. There are multiple tender nodules on the palmar surface of her fingertips. Funduscopic examination shows retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. An ECG shows atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block. What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's condition?",Enterococcus faecalis infection,Septic emboli,N,Sepsis,N,Sepsis,N,Endocarditis,Y,Sepsis,N,,"The key clinical features in this case include a recent history of surgery and severe urinary tract infection, current symptoms of lethargy, chills, difficulty breathing, fever, and new cardiovascular findings such as a holosystolic murmur and atrial fibrillation. The physical examination also highlights multiple tender nodules on the fingertips (Osler nodes), retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots), and a large conjunctival hemorrhage. All of these signs suggest systemic embolism, and the presence of a new heart murmur may indicate valvular involvement. Considering the patient's history and presentation, the most likely underlying etiology is infective endocarditis. It's a severe infection of the heart valves or endocardium that can cause systemic signs due to septic emboli, which aligns well with the observed symptoms.",Infective Endocarditis,Y,"The differential for this patient includes endocarditis, systemic infection, a malignancy-related condition, or a coagulation disorder. The patient has a new holosystolic murmur over the apex and multiple tender nodules on the palmar surface of her fingertips, suggestive of Osler's nodes, and retinal hemorrhages with pale centers, suggestive of Roth's spots. These are all classic signs of infective endocarditis. The fact that she was treated in the intensive care unit for a severe urinary tract infection and has atrial fibrillation (which could lead to thromboembolism) could have potentially created conditions for bacterial spread and colonization on the heart valves, leading to infective endocarditis. The large conjunctival hemorrhage in her left eye can be a sign of septic emboli, another common symptom in endocarditis. The patient's history of recent hospitalization and surgery, combined with the findings on physical examination, makes infective endocarditis the most likely diagnosis.",Infective Endocarditis,Y,"This patient presents with several signs consistent with infective endocarditis: new holosystolic murmur, fever, lethargy, chills, retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots), and tender nodules on her fingertips (Osler nodes). Her recent hospital stay, including time in intensive care, and her history of cancer and type 2 diabetes could have increased her risk for infection. The conjunctival hemorrhage could also suggest a systemic infection leading to coagulation issues, which would be consistent with infective endocarditis. The atrial fibrillation and right bundle branch block shown on ECG could be associated with cardiac complications due to infective endocarditis.",Infective endocarditis,Y,"The new holosystolic murmur at the apex, fever, and multiple tender nodules on the fingertips (Osler's nodes) strongly suggest infective endocarditis. The retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots) are also a characteristic sign of this condition. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and the use of warfarin increase the risk of forming nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and the severe urinary tract infection and subsequent ICU stay increase the chance of a secondary bacterial infection seeding those vegetations. Her recent colonic surgery and her uncontrolled diabetes are risk factors for bacteremia and septicemia, which might seed a potential nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis with bacteria, leading to infective endocarditis.",Infective endocarditis,Y,"The prior probability of infective endocarditis is 1% given the patient's age. However, this patient has several risk factors, which adjust the probabilities. A new holosystolic murmur over the apex increases the probability of infective endocarditis to 15%. The presence of a large conjunctival hemorrhage and retinal hemorrhages with pale centers (Roth spots) increases the probability further to 40%. The tender nodules on her fingertips, known as Osler nodes, a classic sign of infective endocarditis, elevate the probability further to 60%. Furthermore, her recent hospitalization with a severe infection, and the subsequent need for an invasive procedure (catheterization), and her longstanding atrial fibrillation (which increases the risk of blood stasis and clot formation, providing a possible nidus for infection) all increase the likelihood of infective endocarditis to 75%. In addition, her fever and chills, signs of systemic infection, combined with the noted physical findings and history, increase the posterior probability of infective endocarditis to approximately 90%. Therefore, this patient most likely has infective endocarditis.",Infective Endocarditis,Y
"A 23-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for knee pain. The patient states it started yesterday and has been steadily worsening. She recently joined a volleyball team to try to get into shape as she was informed that weight loss would be beneficial for her at her last physical exam. She states that she has been repetitively pivoting and twisting on her knee while playing volleyball. The patient has a past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is currently taking oral contraceptive pills. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/88 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals an obese woman with facial hair. Physical exam is notable for tenderness that is mediated with palpation over the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. Her BMI is 37 kg/m^2. The rest of the exam of the lower extremity is not remarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pes anserine bursitis,Patellar tendinitis,N,Shin splints.,N,Medial tibial stress syndrome.,N,Meniscal tear,N,Patellar tendinitis,N,,"The patient presents with pain in her knee that has been worsening since it started, and she has been participating in a sport that involves repetitive pivoting and twisting on the knee. This, combined with her obesity, indicates that she is putting excess strain on her knees. The location of the tenderness on her knee, the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella, is the common site for pes anserine bursitis, a condition often seen in obese individuals and in activities with sudden changes of direction. There are no indications of infection or systemic disease, making local overuse the most likely cause.",Pes anserine bursitis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, medial collateral ligament (MCL) tear, meniscus tear, patellar dislocation, patellar tendonitis, or medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints). The patient's history of recent engagement in a sport that requires repetitive pivoting and twisting on the knee, such as volleyball, makes injuries such as ACL, MCL, or meniscus tear possible. However, physical exam findings such as tenderness localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella are more consistent with medial tibial stress syndrome, often referred to as shin splints. This condition is often seen in those who are new to a sport or have recently increased their activity level. It is typically exacerbated by activity and relieved with rest. Obesity, as seen in this patient, is also a risk factor. Despite her past medical history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, it doesn't seem directly related to her knee pain.",Medial Tibial Stress Syndrome,N,"The patient presents with knee pain that started after she joined a volleyball team and started repetitive pivoting and twisting movements on her knee. Her physical exam is notable for tenderness localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just inferior to the patella. These findings are consistent with pes anserine bursitis, a condition common in athletes (especially those involved in activities with sudden changes in direction), and in overweight individuals. Given her recent increase in physical activity, her obesity (BMI 37 kg/m^2), and the localizing signs of inflammation at the pes anserinus (the conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles located at the medial knee), pes anserine bursitis is the most likely diagnosis.",Pes anserine bursitis,Y,"The patient's presentation suggests overuse of the knee in the setting of new physical activity. Her symptoms of pain worsened by pivoting and twisting, as well as tenderness on palpation over the medial aspect of the tibia just below the patella, are indicative of pes anserinus bursitis. This is an inflammation of the bursa located between the shin bone (tibia) and the tendons of the hamstring muscle at the inside of the knee. It often occurs due to repetitive or prolonged activities that strain the pes anserinus tendons such as sports that involve a lot of running or sudden direction changes. Obesity, as in this patient, is also a known risk factor for the development of pes anserinus bursitis.",Pes anserinus bursitis,Y,"The initial or prior probability of a diagnosis in this case could be considered broad, given the common complaint of knee pain. However, considering the patient's recent history of increased physical activity with repeated pivoting and twisting movements on the knee, a condition related to overuse or acute injury becomes more likely. Let's say this raises the possibility of medial collateral ligament (MCL) strain to a 20% likelihood. The presence of pain localized to the medial aspect of the tibia just below the patella, the anatomical location of the MCL, raises this probability further to, say, 50%. Finally, taking into account the patient's elevated BMI, which can contribute to an increased risk of injury, this could push the posterior probability of MCL strain even higher to around 70%. Thus, based on this Bayesian analysis, an MCL strain is the most likely diagnosis.",Medial collateral ligament strain,N
"A 53-year-old man is brought to the emergency department following an episode of loss of consciousness 1 hour ago. He had just finished micturating, when he fell down. His wife heard the noise and found him unconscious on the floor. He regained consciousness after 30 seconds and was able to talk normally with his wife immediately. There was no urinary incontinence. On arrival, he is alert and oriented. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. An electrocardiogram shows no abnormalities.

This is a common scenario for a condition called micturition syncope, which is a type of neurally mediated syncope. Syncope refers to a brief loss of consciousness, or fainting, which is often related to insufficient blood flow to the brain. In the case of micturition syncope, the act of urinating can lead to a sudden drop in blood pressure, causing temporary insufficient blood supply to the brain, resulting in a brief loss of consciousness. The fact that the patient regained consciousness quickly, and had no urinary incontinence or abnormal findings on cardiopulmonary and neurological examinations, supports this diagnosis.",Micturition syncope,Y,"The differential for this patient includes vasovagal syncope, postural hypotension, arrhythmia, transient ischemic attack, seizure, and certain metabolic conditions like hypoglycemia. However, the patient's lack of urinary incontinence or other postictal symptoms makes a seizure unlikely. The patient also regained consciousness quickly and did not have any neurologic abnormalities, which makes a transient ischemic attack unlikely. Metabolic conditions like hypoglycemia are ruled out by the normal serum concentrations of glucose and creatinine. The patient's episode of loss of consciousness occurred post-micturition, a common scenario in vasovagal syncope, and his electrocardiogram was normal, which makes an arrhythmia less likely. Thus, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is vasovagal syncope.",Vasovagal syncope,Y,"The patient had a transient loss of consciousness after micturition, without any associated neurological deficits, incontinence, or post-ictal phase, which are typically seen in seizures.

Micturition syncope is a type of situational syncope that occurs during or after urination. The exact mechanism is not completely understood but it's thought to involve a combination of vasodilation in the lower limbs after the act of standing for urination, alongside the decreased return of venous blood to the heart due to the straining. This results in a transient decrease in blood flow to the brain, causing a brief loss of consciousness. The fact that the patient quickly regained consciousness, had no incontinence, and displays no abnormal findings on examination or in his test results further supports this diagnosis.",Micturition syncope,Y,"The prior probability of a micturition syncope, which is a type of situational syncope that occurs during or after micturition, is fairly low at 2%. However, given that the man fainted immediately after urinating, this raises the posterior probability to 15%. The fact that he regained consciousness after 30 seconds and didn't present any abnormal neurological findings further increases the probability to 25%. Furthermore, the absence of urinary incontinence (which might indicate a seizure) and the lack of abnormal findings on his ECG (which could suggest a cardiac cause of syncope) increase the likelihood of a micturition syncope to 50%. Finally, the fact that his blood glucose, creatinine, and electrolyte levels were all normal (which could suggest an endocrine or metabolic cause of syncope) pushes the final probability of a micturition syncope to around 65%.

This, coupled with the presence of hemorrhages underneath his fingernails (splinter hemorrhages), and tender, red nodules on his fingers (Osler's nodes) indicates infective endocarditis. The presence of a pre-existing bicuspid aortic valve would predispose him to this condition. The most common causal organisms of infective endocarditis are viridans group streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, but in a person with a history of congenital heart disease, such as a bicuspid aortic valve, viridans group streptococci are the most common.",Viridans group streptococci,Y,"The differential for this patient includes conditions associated with fatigue, dyspnea, fever, and night sweats, such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, and other infections. However, given his history of a bicuspid aortic valve and new onset of systolic murmur, cardiac involvement such as infective endocarditis should be strongly considered. The presence of splinter hemorrhages (hemorrhages underneath fingernails) and Osler's nodes (tender, red nodules on fingers) further support this diagnosis.

Infective endocarditis can be caused by a number of organisms, but the most common are usually bacteria that inhabit the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract. In patients with native valves (such as a bicuspid aortic valve), the most common organisms are Streptococcus viridans or Staphylococcus aureus. Given the absence of any noted high-risk behaviors (e.g., intravenous drug use) that would increase the likelihood of S. aureus, the most likely organism in this case is Streptococcus viridans.",Streptococcus viridans,Y,"This patient's symptoms of fever, night sweats, fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, combined with the physical findings of a systolic murmur (suggestive of his known bicuspid aortic valve) and Janeway lesions (the hemorrhages underneath his fingernails) and Osler's nodes (the tender, red nodules on his fingers) are all highly suggestive of infective endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart, most often affecting the heart valves. The most common causal organisms of infective endocarditis vary, but the most common in the general population is Staphylococcus aureus, especially in a patient without a history of intravenous drug use.",Staphylococcus aureus,N,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, low-grade fevers, and night sweats combined with his history of a bicuspid aortic valve suggest the possibility of infective endocarditis. Bicuspid aortic valve is a known risk factor for endocarditis. The findings of hemorrhages underneath the fingernails (splinter hemorrhages) and the tender, red nodules on his fingers (Osler's nodes) are classic peripheral stigmata of infective endocarditis. The most common cause of infective endocarditis is Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in those with a history of valve disease. Additionally, Streptococcus viridans is also a common cause in those with preexisting valve disease.

However, this patient is also a smoker and uses alcohol socially. This suggests a possibility of poor oral hygiene, which increases the risk of Streptococcus viridans endocarditis since this organism is a part of normal oral flora and may enter the bloodstream through damaged oral mucosa. Also, it's worth noting that S. viridans tends to be the more common pathogen in subacute infective endocarditis, which appears to fit this patient's clinical picture better (his symptoms have been ongoing for 2 months).",Streptococcus viridans,Y,"This patient's presentation strongly suggests infective endocarditis. Given the fact that he has a bicuspid aortic valve, a well-known predisposing cardiac condition, the likelihood of infective endocarditis increases significantly.

The prior probability of Staphylococcus aureus causing endocarditis might be 25% in the general population. Given that he has a predisposing cardiac condition (bicuspid aortic valve), this increases the posterior probability to around 35%. The fact that he is presenting with both systemic signs of infection (fatigue, fevers, and night sweats) and local signs of vascular phenomenon (hemorrhages under his fingernails, known as splinter hemorrhages, and tender, red nodules on his fingers, known as Osler's nodes) increases the probability of Staphylococcus aureus as the causative organism to around 50%.

This patient has no history of intravenous drug use, which would make Staphylococcus aureus more likely, but he does have a history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol can be a risk factor for endocarditis due to Streptococcus viridans, but given the severity of the symptoms and the presence of systemic signs, it's more likely to be Staphylococcus aureus, especially given that this bacteria tends to be more virulent.

Thus, the overall probability that the causative organism is Staphylococcus aureus is above 50%.",Staphylococcus aureus,N

This is suggestive of a psychotic disorder, possibly schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Following admission and initiation of therapy, he develops motor abnormalities, specifically a tremor that improves with activity and difficulty walking. This indicates a side effect of the antipsychotic medication likely given to him to manage his psychiatric symptoms. These side effects are typical of typical (first-generation) antipsychotics, like haloperidol, and are commonly termed extrapyramidal symptoms.",Antipsychotic medication side effects,Y,"The differential for this patient includes neurologic diseases such as Parkinson's, side effects from antipsychotic medications, illicit drug use, or metabolic disturbances. His initial presentation is highly suggestive of a psychiatric disorder, possibly a manic episode of Bipolar Disorder or Schizophrenia, given his grandiosity, pressured speech, and possible delusions of persecution. His recent start of therapy and subsequent development of motor symptoms is suggestive of side effects from treatment. Neuroleptic medications, such as antipsychotics used to treat manic symptoms or psychosis, can cause extrapyramidal side effects, including conditions like Parkinsonism, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. This patient's improvement of tremor with activity is not consistent with Parkinson's disease but aligns with medication-induced Parkinsonism which is a reversible condition once the medication is stopped or adjusted. Thus, the most likely cause of his new-onset difficulty walking and tremor is medication-induced Parkinsonism.",Medication-induced Parkinsonism,Y,"This patient initially presents with symptoms such as pressured speech, labile affect, delusions of grandeur, and paranoid delusions which are consistent with a manic or psychotic episode. His symptom profile, negative toxicology screen, and age makes a primary psychiatric disorder like Bipolar or Schizophrenia likely. The new onset difficulty walking and tremor that improves with activity following initiation of therapy suggests a side effect from the treatment of his psychiatric symptoms. Based on the presentation, it's likely that he was started on antipsychotic medication for his psychotic symptoms and the new symptoms are a result of medication-induced Parkinsonism, a common side effect of antipsychotics. This condition presents with bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor that improves with activity (unlike Parkinson's disease, which worsens with activity).",Medication-induced Parkinsonism,Y,"This patient's symptoms of pressured speech, labile affect, and grandiose delusions indicate a psychiatric disorder, most likely bipolar disorder in a manic episode or schizophrenia. His symptoms are severe enough that he has been admitted to the hospital and started on therapy. The development of difficulty walking and a tremor that improves with activity suggests a side effect from the antipsychotic medication he is likely receiving. These symptoms are characteristic of parkinsonism, which is a well-known side effect of many typical and atypical antipsychotic medications. This type of drug-induced parkinsonism occurs as these medications block dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway of the brain, which is responsible for movement coordination.",Antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism,Y,"The prior probability for drug-induced parkinsonism is estimated to be about 3%. The patient's symptoms have dramatically changed, and he has developed motor issues (difficulty walking and a tremor), which increases the posterior probability to 15%. However, a key clue lies in the fact that the patient's tremor improves with activity. This is characteristic of drug-induced parkinsonism and not of classic Parkinson's disease, thus further increasing the posterior probability to 50%. Given that these symptoms appeared after he was admitted to the hospital and began therapy, it's reasonable to assume that he was started on antipsychotic medication to manage his symptoms of pressured speech, labile affect, and grandiose delusions. Antipsychotics, particularly first-generation ones, are known to potentially cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which includes symptoms like the ones the patient has developed. This brings the posterior probability of drug-induced parkinsonism up to 80%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's new symptoms is drug-induced parkinsonism.",Drug-induced parkinsonism,Y
"A 28-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of increasing abdominal pain for 2 days. The pain is diffuse and constant, and she describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. She has also had numbness in her lower extremities for 12 hours. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus, migraine with aura, and essential tremor. She appears uncomfortable. She is oriented to place and person only. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 123/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended abdomen with no tenderness to palpation. Bowel sounds are decreased. Muscle strength and sensation is decreased in the lower extremities. There is a tremor of the right upper extremity. Urinalysis shows elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Primidone,Acute intermittent porphyria,Y,Acute intermittent porphyria,Y,Acute intermittent porphyria,Y,Porphyria,Y,Acute intermittent porphyria.,Y,,"The patient presents with abdominal pain, lower extremity numbness, and a distended abdomen. These symptoms, together with the finding of elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in her urine, are suggestive of acute intermittent porphyria. This condition is a genetic disorder that affects the production of heme, a component of hemoglobin. Acute attacks, which can be precipitated by certain medications, fasting, or stress, may cause neurological symptoms and abdominal pain due to the buildup of porphyrin precursors, aminolevulinic acid, and porphobilinogen.",Acute intermittent porphyria,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes diabetic ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal obstruction, porphyrias, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, her presentation of abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and neuropathy in a patient with a history of chronic conditions suggest an acute porphyria. The finding of elevated aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen levels in the urine further supports this diagnosis as these substances are increased in acute porphyria attacks. Diabetic ketoacidosis is unlikely as she does not exhibit other common symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and increased thirst. Gastrointestinal obstruction is less likely as there is no acute tenderness on palpation and she does not describe symptoms such as vomiting, which are common in obstructions. Guillain-Barre syndrome is also less likely given her lack of a preceding infection, and although it can cause neuropathy, it wouldn't account for her abdominal pain or the biochemical findings. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an acute porphyria attack.",Acute porphyria attack,Y,"This patient presents with abdominal pain, mental disorientation, lower extremity neuropathy, and a right upper extremity tremor, along with a history of migraine and essential tremor. The laboratory finding of elevated aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in her urine suggests a disorder of heme synthesis. These findings are characteristic of acute intermittent porphyria, which often presents with neurovisceral attacks that include abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and changes in mental status. This patient's symptoms are likely due to acute intermittent porphyria.",Acute intermittent porphyria,Y,"This patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, neuropathy, and psychiatric symptoms (confusion), along with the findings of elevated aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen in the urine, are indicative of an acute porphyria attack. Porphyria is a group of rare, inherited disorders that involve abnormalities in heme biosynthesis. Aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen are precursors in the heme synthesis pathway that accumulate due to the enzymatic defects in this pathway. The most common acute porphyria is Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP). Attacks can be precipitated by certain medications, hormonal changes, and stressors. Given the patient's history of type 1 diabetes, it is also possible that poor glycemic control could have acted as a stressor triggering the attack. The presence of essential tremor and migraines can be a result of porphyria or separate comorbid conditions.",Acute Porphyria Attack,Y,"The prior probability of Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) in a young woman presenting with neurological and abdominal symptoms can be considered around 5%. The presence of abdominal pain and neurological symptoms including numbness and confusion, raises the posterior probability to 20%. In addition, her urinalysis shows elevated levels of aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen, which are highly indicative of a porphyria, specifically AIP, further increasing the probability to 70%. Considering the patient's age, gender, and symptom profile along with the urinalysis results, it is highly likely that the symptoms are due to an episode of Acute Intermittent Porphyria.",Acute Intermittent Porphyria,Y
"One week after undergoing sigmoidectomy with end colostomy for complicated diverticulitis, a 67-year-old man has upper abdominal pain. During the surgery, he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells. His postoperative course was uncomplicated. Two days ago, he developed fever. He is currently receiving parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. He is oriented to person, but not to place and time. Prior to admission, his medications included metformin, valsartan, aspirin, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg. Examination shows jaundice of the conjunctivae. Abdominal examination shows tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding; bowel sounds are hypoactive. Laboratory studies show:

He has been receiving parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter, a known risk factor for bloodstream infection. He shows signs of systemic inflammation (fever and leukocytosis) and infection (orientation to person, but not place or time). His lab results show evidence of liver involvement, with an elevation in his aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, with a greater proportion being direct (conjugated), suggesting impaired excretion of bilirubin into the bile ducts or from the bile ducts into the intestine. The elevated liver enzymes indicate liver damage. His recent surgery, the presence of a central venous catheter, and these symptoms together point towards a potential diagnosis of sepsis, likely secondary to a liver abscess or cholangitis, since he has fever and increased liver enzymes. However, the fact that there's tenderness in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, jaundice, and the liver function test abnormalities are indicative of cholecystitis, inflammation of the gallbladder. The most likely diagnosis in this patient, therefore, is acute cholecystitis.",Acute cholecystitis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes acute cholecystitis, acute hepatitis, liver abscess, sepsis from a different source, and drug-induced liver injury. His recent surgery and central venous catheter use increase his risk for infection. His current presentation of fever, upper abdominal pain, jaundice, and laboratory findings suggestive of cholestasis (elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin) and hepatocellular injury (elevated aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) are most consistent with acute cholecystitis. The fact that his symptoms started several days after surgery also fits with acute cholecystitis, which can be triggered by recent surgery. His age, diabetes, and recent transfusion are risk factors for acute cholecystitis. Hepatitis would typically present with more systemic symptoms and higher transaminase levels. A liver abscess could present similarly but is less likely given the absence of a known source of infection and his relatively well-appearing state. Sepsis from another source or drug-induced liver injury would typically not cause localized right upper quadrant pain.",Acute cholecystitis,Y,"The patient in question has recently undergone surgery and is exhibiting symptoms of upper abdominal pain, fever, disorientation, jaundice, and a raised leukocyte count. Furthermore, the laboratory results show elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin, all of which are indicative of liver dysfunction. Given his recent surgery and the parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter, these findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of cholangitis or potentially cholecystitis. However, the relative lack of gallbladder-specific symptoms (like Murphy's sign) and the presence of a central venous catheter make cholangitis more likely, particularly catheter-associated bloodstream infection leading to a bacterial cholangitis. This situation is plausible as he could have been colonized with a pathogen that subsequently entered his bloodstream and infected the biliary tract.",Bacterial Cholangitis,N,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of acute cholecystitis. The abdominal pain localized to the right upper quadrant, the recent surgery with blood transfusion, the parenteral nutrition, and the high leukocyte count all point to an acute inflammatory process. Furthermore, the abnormal liver function tests - particularly the elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), along with elevated bilirubin - suggest a hepatobiliary origin of this inflammation. While the direct bilirubin is also elevated, the ratio is more in line with intrahepatic processes such as acute cholecystitis. Furthermore, fever and leukocytosis support a diagnosis of infection. The use of parenteral nutrition increases the risk of cholecystitis due to gallbladder stasis and subsequent biliary sludge. His confusion may also be a sign of sepsis, further highlighting the possibility of acute cholecystitis.",Acute cholecystitis,Y,"The patient has had recent surgery with blood transfusion and is currently receiving parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter. The prior probability of cholangitis in this context could be estimated to be 10%.

The fever (38.9C or 102F) and jaundice seen in this patient increase the posterior probability of cholangitis to 25%. This is because fever and jaundice are part of Charcot's triad (fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant pain), which are common symptoms seen in cholangitis.

The abnormal liver function tests (increased aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels) further increase the likelihood of cholangitis to 60%.

Finally, the presence of right upper quadrant tenderness, another part of Charcot's triad, increases the posterior probability of cholangitis to around 85%.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is cholangitis.",Cholangitis,N

These symptoms are suggestive of an infection, more specifically postpartum endometritis, which is inflammation of the endometrial lining of the uterus. Postpartum endometritis is typically caused by a bacterial infection that occurs after childbirth, particularly after prolonged labor or a difficult delivery, both of which were present in this case.",Postpartum endometritis,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: endometritis, urinary tract infection (UTI), puerperal sepsis, wound infection, and atonic postpartum hemorrhage. She has a tender uterus and fever which is typically seen in endometritis. Frequent urination may be a symptom of UTI, but it's also a common occurrence after delivery as the body eliminates excess fluid carried during pregnancy. The presence of minor bibasilar crackles on pulmonary examination may indicate fluid overload but isn't specific for any of the conditions in the differential. Given that she is two days postpartum, the increased urinary frequency, and the absence of other specific signs for conditions like UTI or wound infection, endometritis becomes the most likely diagnosis. Endometritis usually occurs within 2-3 days after delivery, especially in cases where the labor was prolonged, which matches the patient's presentation.",Endometritis,Y,"The patient is a postpartum woman with symptoms including fever, tachycardia, uterine tenderness, and urinary frequency. The most likely diagnosis in this setting is postpartum endometritis, which is an infection of the decidua (endometrium after delivery). Risk factors for postpartum endometritis include cesarean delivery (though the patient in this case had a vaginal delivery), prolonged rupture of membranes, and prolonged labor. The pathogenesis usually involves ascending infection from the lower genital tract. While a urinalysis has been ordered to assess for possible urinary tract infection, the constellation of symptoms more specifically points to postpartum endometritis.",Postpartum endometritis,Y,"This patient recently delivered a large baby, which is a risk factor for postpartum complications, such as endometritis (infection of the lining of the uterus), typically caused by ascending infection from the lower genital tract, especially in the setting of prolonged labor. Symptoms usually begin within the first two days after delivery, and include fever, uterine tenderness, and malodorous lochia. Decreased bowel sounds may be a reflection of generalized ileus due to systemic illness. Furthermore, urinary frequency can be attributed to postpartum diuresis which commonly occurs as the body eliminates excess fluid accumulated during pregnancy. The minor bibasilar crackles might be an incidental finding, likely related to postpartum fluid shifts. Thus, this patient most likely has endometritis.",Endometritis,Y,"The prior probability of postpartum endometritis, given that she is in the postpartum period, is quite high - around 5%. This woman has a fever (increasing the probability to around 20%) and uterine tenderness (increasing it further to around 40%). The fact that she had a prolonged labor and delivered a large baby, both of which are risk factors for endometritis, increases the probability even further to around 70%. Her increased urinary frequency does not significantly change the probability, as it can be a symptom of a variety of postpartum conditions. The pending laboratory studies and urinalysis may offer additional insight, but given her symptoms and risk factors, postpartum endometritis is the most likely diagnosis.",Postpartum Endometritis,Y
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing blurring of vision in both eyes. She says that the blurring has made it difficult to read, although she has noticed that she can read a little better if she holds the book below or above eye level. She also requires a bright light to look at objects. She reports that her symptoms began 8 years ago and have gradually gotten worse over time. She has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide and lisinopril. When looking at an Amsler grid, she says that the lines in the center appear wavy and bent.

When she looks at an Amsler grid, the lines in the center appear wavy and bent, which can indicate damage to the central part of the retina, the macula. These symptoms, along with the patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (both of which can lead to damage of the blood vessels in the retina) suggest a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The fundoscopy would likely show changes consistent with this diagnosis, such as drusen (yellow deposits under the retina), areas of atrophy, or new blood vessel formation.",Age-related macular degeneration,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: cataracts, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, presbyopia, and retinal detachment. This patient has symptoms of blurring vision, difficulty in reading that improves with changing the level of the book and requiring a bright light to look at objects which could indicate macular degeneration. The distorted vision or metamorphopsia and wavy lines on Amsler grid is characteristic for macular degeneration. Further, the long-term presence of her symptoms (8 years) that have gradually worsened, as opposed to an acute or sudden onset, also supports macular degeneration. Unfortunately, the image is not available, but if it showed drusen (yellow deposits beneath the retina), or neovascular changes, this would confirm macular degeneration.",Macular degeneration,Y,"Unfortunately, without the actual image of the retina, it is impossible to give a definitive diagnosis. However, based on the symptoms provided such as gradually worsening blurred vision, need for bright light, difficulty in reading unless the book is held below or above eye level, and distorted lines on the Amsler grid - these symptoms suggest a diagnosis of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is also more common in older patients, patients with hypertension, and diabetes, all of which are present in this patient.",Age-related macular degeneration,Y,"The patient's symptoms of blurring vision that is worse at certain angles, her need for bright light, and her reporting that lines on the Amsler grid appear wavy all suggest an issue with the macula, which is responsible for central vision and discerning detail. These symptoms along with the chronic progression of the condition are suggestive of macular degeneration. Moreover, the risk of developing macular degeneration is known to increase with age and conditions like hypertension and diabetes, both of which this patient has. The image from the fundoscopy would likely show drusen (small yellow deposits) under the retina if macular degeneration was the correct diagnosis, but unfortunately, it's not included in the provided data.",Macular degeneration,Y,"Unfortunately, I can't see the image of the retina as a language model AI. But based on the information given, the posterior probabilities can be worked out in the following manner:

The prior probability of macular degeneration in this population is about 10%. Macular degeneration would cause blurriness in the central visual field and distortions in lines that should be straight, a symptom called metamorphopsia. Seeing wavy lines on an Amsler grid, which this patient does, increases the probability of macular degeneration to 40%. The patient's long-standing visual changes and need for bright light to see (implying difficulty with contrast) further increases the likelihood to 60%. The slow progression over many years is consistent with the dry form of age-related macular degeneration, further increasing the probability to 80%. Thus, without seeing the retinal image, we can still reasonably conclude that this patient most likely has age-related macular degeneration.",Age-related macular degeneration,Y
"A 61-year-old diabetic woman is brought to the emergency department with the complaint of multiple bouts of abdominal pain in the last 24 hours. She says that the pain is dull aching in nature, radiates to the back, and worsens with meals. She also complains of nausea and occasional vomiting. She has been hospitalized repeatedly in the past with similar complaints. Her temperature is 37° C (98.6° F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. On physical exam, dark hyperpigmentation of the axillary skin is noted. Her blood test report from last month is given below:

Her HbA1c level suggests poorly controlled diabetes. These findings, along with her history of multiple similar episodes, suggest pancreatitis. High triglyceride levels (>500 mg/dL) and uncontrolled diabetes are recognized risk factors for pancreatitis. The pain pattern described � dull and radiating to the back � is consistent with this condition. The hyperpigmentation in her axilla could be a sign of insulin resistance, a condition that's associated with both diabetes and pancreatitis.",Pancreatitis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, peptic ulcer disease, and myocardial infarction. Considering her presenting symptoms of dull aching abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a history of similar symptoms, acute pancreatitis seems likely. Further, the pain worsens with meals, which is a common characteristic of pancreatitis.

Her chronic hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides: 675 mg/dL, normal: <150 mg/dL) can precipitate acute pancreatitis, especially when the level is above 500 mg/dL. The patient also has poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c: 9.1%, normal: <5.7% for non-diabetics) which can be both a cause and a consequence of chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, the dark hyperpigmentation of the axillary skin may suggest the development of diabetes-related complications.

Her other lab findings including liver function tests (Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate aminotransferase) and kidney function tests (serum Creatinine, BUN) are within normal limits, so acute cholecystitis, peptic ulcer disease, and myocardial infarction become less likely.

In conclusion, this patient's presenting symptoms along with a history of poorly controlled diabetes and significantly elevated triglyceride levels most likely point to a diagnosis of pancreatitis.",Pancreatitis,Y,"This patient presents with recurrent abdominal pain, especially after meals, nausea, and occasional vomiting. These are typical signs of pancreatitis. The high triglyceride level is especially noteworthy; hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known cause of pancreatitis, particularly when levels exceed 500 mg/dL, as in this patient's case. Furthermore, pancreatitis can be recurrent with high levels of triglycerides. The dark hyperpigmentation in axillary areas may also suggest poorly controlled diabetes, which is consistent with the high HbA1c level. This patient, therefore, most likely has hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis.",Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis,Y,"This patient has a history of diabetes and has very high triglyceride levels, both risk factors for pancreatitis. The abdominal pain that worsens with meals, nausea, vomiting, and recurrent episodes are highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. Furthermore, the presence of hyperpigmentation in her axilla could be a sign of hemochromatosis, a condition that is associated with secondary causes of pancreatitis. High serum iron levels lead to iron deposition in various organs, including the pancreas, leading to pancreatic damage and chronic pancreatitis. It's worth noting that although alcohol is the most common cause of chronic pancreatitis, hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride levels > 1000 mg/dL) and other factors such as genetic disorders can also lead to this condition.",Chronic pancreatitis,N,"The prior probability of chronic pancreatitis in a person with diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia is around 5%.

Her symptoms of weakness, confusion, and dark brown urine are suggestive of a syndrome that commonly occurs during refeeding in malnourished patients. As calories are reintroduced, insulin levels increase, driving glucose into cells and causing a shift in electrolytes. Phosphorus is used in the production of ATP (a key energy molecule in the body), and this sudden high demand for phosphorus can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, a condition known as refeeding syndrome. Rapid shifts in fluids and electrolytes can cause serious complications such as cardiac failure, respiratory failure, and even death. The dark brown urine could be due to rhabdomyolysis, another complication of severe malnutrition and refeeding, which can occur due to muscle breakdown when the body is searching for nutrients. This results in a large release of myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can be harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure.",Refeeding Syndrome,Y,"The differential for this patient includes refeeding syndrome, dehydration, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, and rhabdomyolysis. The presence of dark brown urine is often associated with rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue, leading to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood, including the protein myoglobin which can cause kidney damage. Weakness and confusion can be due to electrolyte imbalances or kidney damage. Considering this patient's malnourished state, the sudden shift to a relatively high calorie intake might have stressed her starved body, leading to rapid utilization of available nutrients and electrolytes and causing rhabdomyolysis. Therefore, the most likely cause of her symptoms is rhabdomyolysis.",Rhabdomyolysis,N,"This patient has a low BMI indicating severe malnourishment due to anorexia nervosa. She is currently undergoing refeeding in the hospital. The sudden intake of calories in a malnourished patient can cause a shift of electrolytes, leading to what is known as refeeding syndrome. Phosphorus is one of the main electrolytes that gets depleted in this process, leading to symptoms such as weakness and confusion. The presence of dark brown urine may indicate rhabdomyolysis, a serious condition where muscle tissue breaks down rapidly, releasing myoglobin into the bloodstream which can damage the kidneys. This can occur due to severe electrolyte imbalances including low phosphorus levels.",Refeeding syndrome,Y,"The patient's presentation strongly suggests refeeding syndrome. After a prolonged period of starvation, such as in anorexia nervosa, the body shifts to using fat and protein for energy, depleting intracellular stores of electrolytes. When nutritional replenishment begins, insulin secretion increases, which promotes cellular uptake of glucose along with phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. This shift can lead to severe, even fatal, electrolyte and fluid imbalances. One of the characteristic features is hypophosphatemia which can lead to muscle weakness and confusion. Additionally, dark brown urine can be a sign of rhabdomyolysis, which may be caused by hypophosphatemia.",Refeeding syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of refeeding syndrome, which can occur when reintroducing nutrition to severely malnourished patients, is roughly 1% in the general population. However, given that this patient is being treated for anorexia nervosa, the likelihood of refeeding syndrome is increased to 15%. Furthermore, the symptoms described�weakness and confusion�are commonly seen in patients suffering from refeeding syndrome due to electrolyte disturbances, raising the posterior probability to 40%. The mention of dark brown urine may indicate myoglobinuria as a result of rhabdomyolysis, a potential complication of refeeding syndrome, which increases the posterior probability to 65%. Taken together, these factors suggest that the patient's symptoms are likely due to refeeding syndrome.",Refeeding Syndrome,Y

A key clue in this case is the positioning of the right leg, which is slightly shortened, flexed, adducted, and internally rotated. This is typically seen in a posterior dislocation of the hip. A hip dislocation is a serious injury often caused by significant forces such as in a motor vehicle accident. Femoral neck fracture is also possible, but it often presents with external rotation rather than internal rotation of the hip.

This is a severe injury often caused by high-energy trauma, like a car accident, and requires immediate medical attention to prevent complications, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The mechanism of injury (rear-end collision) and the pattern of pain and deformity (right groin pain, altered leg position) are consistent with this diagnosis.",Hip dislocation,Y,"The mechanism of injury, coupled with the patient's specific symptomatology, is indicative of a particular type of hip injury. The patient was involved in a rear-end collision, a common scenario for hip dislocations due to the forces involved in such accidents. Moreover, her clinical presentation of the right leg being shortened, flexed, adducted, and internally rotated is a classic presentation of a posterior hip dislocation. The high-energy impact of the accident forces the hip joint to move backwards out of the socket, causing the leg to assume this characteristic position.

This organism is part of the normal skin flora but can overgrow in certain conditions such as high humidity and high temperature, leading to the formation of hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules that do not tan in the sun.",Pityriasis Versicolor,Y,"The differential diagnosis for hypopigmented macules includes vitiligo, pityriasis alba, tinea versicolor, post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, leprosy, and sarcoidosis.
Given the patient's age, the longstanding nature of her lesions, the absence of scaling (which is often present in tinea versicolor), and the absence of other symptoms that might suggest a systemic disease like sarcoidosis or leprosy, vitiligo and pityriasis alba become more likely.

However, vitiligo often tends to have a more stark contrast with the surrounding skin, and the lesions are usually completely devoid of pigment (making them appear white, not just lighter than the surrounding skin). Additionally, vitiligo often has a predilection for areas around body orifices and the joints, which is not described in this case.

On the other hand, pityriasis alba is a common condition that usually presents in children and adolescents as well-demarcated, hypopigmented, slightly scaly patches on the face and upper extremities. While this patient's rash is not on her face or arms, it's possible that it could present atypically on her chest and abdomen.

Nevertheless, the history and presentation most strongly fit tinea versicolor, a common superficial fungal infection that causes hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules with fine scales, especially in warm and humid climates, which may fit the patient's Latin American origin. The lesions can be quite variable in color, from light tan to dark brown to pink, and they tend to be more noticeable after sun exposure because they don't tan as the surrounding skin does.",Tinea Versicolor,Y,"This patient presents with hypopigmented macules that have been present for a couple of years, are light-colored and do not tan with sun exposure. This presentation is suggestive of Tinea Versicolor, a common superficial fungal infection often caused by the yeast Malassezia furfur. This yeast is a part of normal skin flora, but can overgrow in certain conditions and cause these hypopigmented, often slightly scaly, patches. It is typically harmless but can be a cosmetic concern due to the discoloration.",Tinea Versicolor,Y,"This young woman presents with hypopigmented macules on her chest and abdomen that have been present for a couple of years and don't tan with sun exposure. This presentation is consistent with tinea versicolor, also known as pityriasis versicolor. Tinea versicolor is a common superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia species, a yeast that is part of the normal skin flora. When overgrowth occurs, the yeast interferes with the normal pigmentation of the skin, leading to hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules that may coalesce into patches. These patches often do not tan in the sun, resulting in a more pronounced appearance in people with darker skin or in the summer months.",Tinea versicolor,Y,"The prior probability of Tinea Versicolor is around 1% in the general population. The presence of hypopigmented macules on the chest and abdomen, increases the posterior probability of Tinea Versicolor to 25%. The patient's statement that these areas do not tan like the rest of her skin when exposed to sun further increases the probability to 60%. The fact that she's been noticing this rash for the last 2 years, a timeline consistent with Tinea Versicolor, raises the probability to 80%. This patient most likely has Tinea Versicolor.",Tinea Versicolor,Y
"A 28-year-old man presents for severe abdominal pain and is diagnosed with appendicitis. He is taken for emergent appendectomy. During the procedure, the patient has massive and persistent bleeding requiring a blood transfusion. The preoperative laboratory studies showed a normal bleeding time, normal prothrombin time (PT), an INR of 1.0, and a normal platelet count. Postoperatively, when the patient is told about the complications during the surgery, he recalls that he forgot to mention that he has a family history of an unknown bleeding disorder. The postoperative laboratory tests reveal a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Hemophilia A,Factor XI deficiency,Y,Von Willebrand Disease,Y,Hereditary bleeding disorder,N,Von Willebrand disease,Y,Hemophilia,Y,,"The patient has a family history of an unknown bleeding disorder, and the postoperative laboratory tests reveal a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) while other tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and platelet count remain normal. PTT is used to assess the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation, including the function of clotting factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen). Therefore, a disorder associated with a normal PT but prolonged PTT would indicate a possible defect in the intrinsic pathway or common pathway, excluding factor VII which is part of the extrinsic pathway measured by PT. Considering these factors, the patient's bleeding disorder could be related to Hemophilia A or B (Factor VIII or IX deficiency respectively), or a deficiency in other factors such as Factor XI or XII. However, Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) are the most common severe inherited coagulation factor deficiencies. Since this patient underwent surgery (a significant hemostatic challenge), it would be reasonable to assume that he has one of the more severe inherited bleeding disorders, Hemophilia A or B. Given Hemophilia A is more common, it is statistically the most likely diagnosis.",Hemophilia A,Y,"The differential diagnosis for a patient with a prolonged PTT (partial thromboplastin time) and a normal PT (prothrombin time) includes hemophilia A, hemophilia B, von Willebrand's disease, and a deficiency in factors XI, XII, or IX. The patient's history of unexplained, severe intraoperative bleeding and a family history of an unknown bleeding disorder suggests a hereditary coagulation factor deficiency.

Hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders characterized by deficiencies in factor VIII and IX, respectively. von Willebrand's disease is a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, which can lead to factor VIII deficiency because von Willebrand factor carries and stabilizes factor VIII. A deficiency in factors XI, XII, or IX would also prolong the PTT, but these are less common.

Given that the patient has normal PT and platelet count but an increased PTT, this suggests a disorder of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) is the most common severe bleeding disorder, followed by Hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). Given the higher prevalence, the patient is more likely to have hemophilia A.",Hemophilia A,Y,"This patient's laboratory findings of normal PT and platelet count with a prolonged PTT suggest a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The intrinsic pathway involves several clotting factors including VIII, IX, XI, and XII. The normal bleeding time excludes platelet-related disorders, and the normal PT excludes factor VII and fibrinogen-related disorders which are part of the extrinsic and common pathways. Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) are X-linked recessive disorders that commonly present with deep tissue, joint, and postoperative bleeding, as seen in this patient. Given the severity of the bleeding and the lack of any other specific clinical pointers, it is not possible to definitively differentiate between hemophilia A and B, but Hemophilia A is more common.",Hemophilia A or B,Y,"This patient's history and laboratory findings suggest an underlying coagulation disorder. The normal PT and INR values indicate that the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways are functioning properly, as these pathways are tested by these specific assays. The prolonged PTT suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common pathway, since PTT measures the functionality of these pathways. The intrinsic pathway includes factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII, so deficiencies in any of these could be the cause. Given the severity of bleeding during surgery, this is more suggestive of a severe disorder such as hemophilia, which involves factor VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B). Hemophilia is a X-linked recessive disorder and is often noted in males with a family history of bleeding disorders, as described in this patient's history.",Hemophilia,Y,"The Bayesian inference steps for diagnosing this patient's bleeding disorder could be described as follows:

Prior probability: The prior probability of a bleeding disorder (e.g. hemophilia) is unknown but significantly increases considering the family history of an unknown bleeding disorder.

The presence of a normal PT and INR and a prolonged PTT suggest an issue with the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which includes factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Since the PT is normal, we can infer that the extrinsic pathway, which includes factor VII, is functioning correctly. This helps narrow down the possible disorders and increases the posterior probability of an intrinsic pathway disorder such as hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or B (factor IX deficiency).

The fact that massive and persistent bleeding occurred during surgery, requiring a blood transfusion, is also indicative of a severe clotting disorder, such as hemophilia. The severity of the bleeding might suggest a severe form of hemophilia, increasing the posterior probability of this diagnosis.

Based on this information, Hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX deficiency) are the most likely diagnoses. However, Hemophilia A is approximately 4-6 times more common than Hemophilia B. Given this, the Bayesian inference would suggest that the probability of the patient having Hemophilia A is higher.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient, considering his clinical history and laboratory results, is Hemophilia A.",Hemophilia A,Y
"A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also has noted severe night sweats, which require a change of clothes and bed linens the next day. His medical history is significant for long-standing hypertension. He received a kidney transplant 6 years ago. His current medications include amlodipine, metoprolol, furosemide, aspirin, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate. His family history is significant for his sister, who died last year from lymphoma. A review of systems is positive for a 6-kg (13.2-lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. His vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple painless lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is palpated on the right side. Abdominal examination is significant for a spleen of 16 cm below the cost margin on percussion.

The presence of splenomegaly and an elevated LDH, a nonspecific marker of cell turnover, further points towards a diagnosis of lymphoma. It's important to note that he received a kidney transplant 6 years ago. Post-transplant patients are at a significantly increased risk for malignancies, including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), due to the necessary chronic immunosuppression to prevent organ rejection. PTLDs can range from benign polyclonal proliferation to malignant monomorphic disorders like non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Given this patient's clinical presentation and history, it's most likely that he has developed a PTLD.",Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes various forms of lymphoma, leukemia, and other malignancies that can cause lymphadenopathy, as well as infections such as HIV or tuberculosis that may cause similar symptoms. However, several key factors make lymphoma the most likely diagnosis: his recent unintentional weight loss, night sweats, and painless lymphadenopathy, along with splenomegaly and a high LDH level are all characteristic of lymphoma. Furthermore, his history of a kidney transplant is also relevant. Immunosuppressive drugs, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate, which he is taking to prevent transplant rejection, can increase the risk of lymphoma. This is known as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), a type of lymphoma that can occur in people who have had organ transplants. Moreover, a family history of lymphoma further increases his risk.

The onset of symptoms after his kidney transplant may also indicate post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), a condition that can occur due to immunosuppressive therapy (tacrolimus, mycophenolate) which is used to prevent transplant rejection. PTLD can present as a variety of conditions, ranging from benign lymphoid hyperplasia to aggressive forms of lymphoma. This patient's sister's history of lymphoma further supports the likelihood of this diagnosis.",Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder,Y,"This patient's presentation of fever, weight loss, night sweats (B symptoms), and generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, along with elevated LDH suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma. His kidney transplant status indicates that he has been on immunosuppressive therapy for a significant period of time. Immunosuppressive therapy, specifically with drugs such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate, increases the risk of developing lymphoproliferative disorders. This, combined with his family history of lymphoma, supports the likely diagnosis of a lymphoproliferative disorder, probably a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An unremarkable peripheral blood smear suggests that this is not a leukemia (which would show abnormal cells in the peripheral blood). The final diagnosis would need to be confirmed by lymph node biopsy.",Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Y,"We start with our prior probabilities. The likelihood of a kidney transplant recipient having lymphoma is 2% to 5% due to immunosuppression. However, we now have additional data to update this prior probability.

The patient has systemic symptoms (night sweats, weight loss, fever), which are known as B symptoms and are associated with lymphomas. This increases our posterior probability to around 15%.
The patient has multiple painless lymphadenopathy. Painless lymphadenopathy, especially in multiple sites, increases the likelihood of lymphoma, increasing the posterior probability to around 30%.
The patient has splenomegaly. Splenomegaly is another symptom of lymphoma, which increases our posterior probability to around 45%.
Finally, the patient has a significantly raised LDH level. Elevated LDH levels can be a sign of tissue damage, including damage caused by rapidly proliferating cells like cancerous cells. This final piece of information would increase our posterior probability to around 70%.

If you could provide the photograph or a more detailed description of the lesion, I would be better able to provide an accurate response.",,N,"In the absence of a provided photograph, we'll have to deduce the diagnosis based on the available description. The differential for a patient with a neck mass includes lipoma, sebaceous cyst, branchial cleft cyst, thyroglossal duct cyst, metastatic lymphadenopathy, and abscess.

Given this patient's history of colon cancer, a key consideration is metastatic disease. However, metastatic cancer would usually present as a hard, non-mobile, and possibly painful mass. This man's nodule is firm, mobile, and painless, which is more consistent with benign conditions such as a lipoma or sebaceous cyst.

The inability to pinch the skin over the nodule could be suggestive of a lipoma or a sebaceous cyst. Lipomas are soft, however, and typically present in areas of fatty tissue, while sebaceous cysts tend to be firm and present in areas of large sebaceous gland density like the neck. Given the consistency and location of the mass, the most likely diagnosis is a sebaceous cyst.",Sebaceous cyst,N,"Without an actual photograph or detailed description of the lesion, it is challenging to provide an accurate diagnosis. However, given that the nodule is firm, mobile, painless, and the skin over the nodule cannot be pinched, a likely diagnosis could be a lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors made up of fat tissue, and they are typically soft, mobile, and painless. However, without visual confirmation, the differential diagnosis could include other conditions like a sebaceous cyst, epidermoid cyst, or potentially metastasis given his history of colon cancer. Still, metastatic disease typically presents as multiple, hard, and immobile nodules rather than a single, firm, and mobile one.",Lipoma,N,"Since no photograph or further description of the lesion is provided, I am unable to accurately assess the characteristics of the lesion and give a probable diagnosis. However, based on the provided information, I can make a hypothetical rationale and answer.

Rationale:
The patient's nodule is located at the nape of his neck and is firm, mobile, and painless. These characteristics suggest a benign growth. Additionally, the fact that the skin over the nodule cannot be pinched could suggest it is a lipoma, which is a benign fatty tumor that occurs in the subcutaneous tissue, often ""slipping"" away under the fingers when trying to pinch the skin above it. Lipomas are common in middle-aged adults and can appear anywhere on the body, but frequently occur on the neck and shoulders.",Lipoma,N,"The prior probability of metastatic disease in a patient with a history of colon cancer is relatively high, let's assume it at around 20%. The presence of a firm, painless nodule on the nape of the neck, which is often a location of lymph nodes, increases the posterior probability of metastatic disease to 40%. The skin over the nodule cannot be pinched, which is another common feature of cancerous lymph nodes, further increasing the probability to 60%. Considering his history of colon cancer, the probability is further increased to around 80%.

Fractures could suggest a history of child abuse, but they could also be indicative of a more systemic issue, particularly when paired with other findings such as hearing impairment. Additionally, the diet of mainly cereal and pasta suggests a lack of dietary variety and therefore potential nutrient deficiencies. One nutrient deficiency that could account for these symptoms is Vitamin D deficiency, as Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption and bone health.

The dental abnormalities could be a feature of dentinogenesis imperfecta, which is often associated with certain types of osteogenesis imperfecta.

The ECG findings, including convex ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V6, are characteristic of anterior wall myocardial infarction, which is typically due to occlusion of the left anterior descending artery. The echocardiogram showing anterolateral hypokinesis (decreased movement of the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle) and an ejection fraction of 45% further confirm the diagnosis and indicate systolic dysfunction, which often results from necrosis of the myocardium due to ischemia. The mechanism underlying this patient's illness is likely atherosclerotic plaque rupture with subsequent thrombosis, causing obstruction of the coronary blood flow leading to myocardial ischemia and infarction.",Atherosclerotic plaque rupture,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Given the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and heavy smoking, there is a high probability of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, the symptomatology of sudden onset, severe chest pain radiating to his arm and neck, associated with nausea and dyspnea, is highly suggestive of an acute MI.

The ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in V1-V6 suggests an acute anteroseptal MI, which usually results from occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. This is further supported by the echocardiographic finding of anterolateral hypokinesis, which represents diminished motion of the anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle, areas supplied by the LAD.

Hypotension and bilateral rales on chest auscultation suggest the presence of pulmonary edema secondary to acute left ventricular failure. This can occur when the pumping function of the heart is compromised, such as during an acute MI, leading to increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation and fluid extravasation into the alveoli.

Retrograde blood flow into the left atrium on echocardiogram suggests some degree of mitral regurgitation, which can occur due to papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture secondary to ischemia in the setting of an acute MI. Papillary muscles, which are responsible for preventing regurgitation of blood into the left atrium by holding the mitral valve flaps in place, receive their blood supply from the LAD as well, and are thus susceptible to damage in the event of an LAD occlusion.

So, to summarize, this patient's symptoms and findings are most consistent with an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction secondary to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, leading to anterolateral left ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary edema, and mitral regurgitation.",Acute myocardial infarction,Y,"This patient's presentation is indicative of a severe myocardial infarction, specifically anterior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as suggested by the ECG changes and the chest pain radiating down the left arm and up the left side of the neck. The presence of rales suggests pulmonary edema due to decreased left ventricular function, which is confirmed by the reduced ejection fraction and the finding of anterolateral hypokinesis on echocardiography. The mechanism of this patient's illness is most likely a thrombotic occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, which supplies blood to the anterior wall and the anterolateral part of the left ventricle. The occlusion leads to myocardial ischemia and, if not promptly treated, infarction in the territory supplied by the occluded artery. This leads to impairment of cardiac function, causing retrograde blood flow into the left atrium and pulmonary congestion, as seen by the presence of bilateral rales.",Thrombotic occlusion in LAD,Y,"This patient's chest pain with radiation to the left arm and neck, along with the difficulty in breathing and nausea, suggest a possible myocardial infarction (MI), a condition commonly associated with risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking, all of which this patient has. His low blood pressure and regular pulse also indicate cardiogenic shock, a possible complication of MI. On auscultation, bilateral rales (crackles) may signify pulmonary edema, a result of left-sided heart failure. ECG findings of ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V6 indicate an anterior wall MI, which corresponds to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory. An echocardiogram showing anterolateral hypokinesis, retrograde blood flow into the left atrium, and a reduced ejection fraction further supports left ventricular dysfunction due to MI. The most likely mechanism of this patient's illness is the formation of an atheromatous plaque in the coronary artery (most likely the LAD given the ECG findings), which ruptured, leading to the formation of a thrombus, occlusion of the blood vessel, ischemia, and necrosis of the heart muscle supplied by the affected artery.",Coronary artery occlusion,Y,"The man's presentation, as outlined in the problem, is strongly indicative of an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The Bayesian analysis begins with a prior probability for AMI. Considering the patient's demographic (age, sex), lifestyle (smoking), and medical history (diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia), the prior probability for AMI is quite high.

The patient presents with characteristic symptoms of chest pain radiating to the left arm and neck, along with difficulty breathing and nausea. These symptoms are all characteristic of AMI, which further increases the posterior probability of AMI.

Then we have some clinical findings. The low blood pressure and high heart rate (tachycardia) can be indicators of cardiogenic shock, a possible complication of a severe myocardial infarction.

The physical examination finding of rales in the lungs may indicate fluid accumulation due to left-sided heart failure, another possible complication of AMI. The ECG changes (ST-segment elevations in V1-V6) are also indicative of a large area of myocardial ischemia, typically seen in AMI.

Finally, the echocardiogram findings of anterolateral hypokinesis (reduced movement of the heart wall) and retrograde blood flow into the left atrium suggest severe impairment in the heart's ability to pump blood, which can result from a significant myocardial infarction.

Each of these factors increases the posterior probability of AMI and its complications. Taken together, these suggest that the likely mechanism of the patient's illness is a severe myocardial infarction leading to heart failure and potential cardiogenic shock.",Acute myocardial infarction,Y
"A 54-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painful skin lesion on her right leg for 1 month. It initially started out as a small red spot but has rapidly increased in size during this period. She remembers an ant bite on her leg prior to the lesion occurring. She was treated for anterior uveitis 8 months ago with corticosteroids. She has Crohn's disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Current medications include insulin, mesalamine, enalapril, and aspirin. She returned from Wisconsin after visiting her son 2 months ago. Her temperature is 37.6°C (98°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 126/88 mm Hg. Examination shows pitting pedal edema of the lower extremities. There is a 4-cm tender ulcerative lesion on the anterior right leg with a central necrotic base and purplish irregular borders. There are dilated tortuous veins in both lower legs. Femoral and pedal pulses are palpated bilaterally. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pyoderma gangrenosum,Cutaneous larva migrans,N,Lyme disease,N,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Y,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Y,Erysipelas,N,,"This patient's presentation of a painful skin lesion on the leg that started as a small red spot and has rapidly grown, along with pitting pedal edema of the lower extremities and dilated tortuous veins in both lower legs, are highly suggestive of venous insufficiency. These signs, in combination with the ulcerative lesion with a necrotic base and purplish irregular borders, point to a diagnosis of venous stasis ulcer. Venous stasis ulcers are a complication of venous insufficiency, a condition where the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart.",Venous stasis ulcer,N,"The differential for this patient includes: deep venous thrombosis, chronic venous insufficiency, cellulitis, stasis dermatitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and peripheral arterial disease. The features of her clinical presentation such as the painful skin lesion with a central necrotic base and purplish irregular borders, the rapid increase in size of the lesion, and her history of Crohn's disease, suggest the possibility of pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis, which can be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease. The dilated tortuous veins and pedal edema in both lower legs could suggest chronic venous insufficiency, however, venous insufficiency often leads to stasis dermatitis and venous leg ulcers, but these tend to have a more gradual onset and the ulcers are generally shallow and not painful. Therefore, given the patient's history and the clinical features of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum.",Pyoderma gangrenosum,Y,"This patient's tender ulcerative lesion with a central necrotic base and irregular purplish borders, in the context of chronic venous insufficiency (indicated by the presence of dilated, tortuous veins and pitting pedal edema), suggests a diagnosis of a venous leg ulcer. Venous ulcers are the most common type of leg ulcer, accounting for up to 70% of all cases, and are often a complication of long-standing venous insufficiency. They typically develop along the medial distal leg, which seems to align with the location mentioned in the case, and often present as irregular, shallow, painful ulcers with a ruddy base. Additionally, it's important to note that her recent travel and diabetes may increase her risk for certain types of skin infections, but the clinical picture provided fits best with a venous ulcer.",Venous leg ulcer,N,"This patient with Crohn's disease and type 2 diabetes presents with a chronic ulcerative lesion, venous dilation, and pitting pedal edema. These findings suggest the presence of a venous ulcer, which typically occurs in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency. This condition is characterized by the inability of the veins to effectively return blood from the lower extremities back to the heart, causing pooling of blood and increasing venous pressure. Over time, the increased pressure can lead to skin changes such as dark pigmentation, eczema, and eventually ulcer formation. The ulcers are typically painful and may have an irregular border, as in this patient. The necrotic base is indicative of poor tissue perfusion and inadequate wound healing, which is also common in individuals with diabetes.",Venous ulcer,N,"Step 1: Start with a prior probability
Our initial prior probability for different diagnoses is usually based on the base rates of the condition, but without that information, let's initially assume each of the potential diagnosis - venous stasis ulcer, arterial ulcer, infected insect bite, pyoderma gangrenosum, etc., all start with a 20% chance.

Step 2: Incorporate new evidence to update our probabilities
The patient has a history of Crohn's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with Crohn's disease, so this evidence increases the posterior probability of pyoderma gangrenosum to say, 40%.

Step 3: Further update our probabilities with additional evidence
She has a rapidly progressing, painful ulcerative lesion with a necrotic base and purplish borders. These features are characteristic of pyoderma gangrenosum, which would further increase the posterior probability of this diagnosis, let's say, to 60%.

Step 4: Incorporate more evidence
The presence of lower extremity edema and tortuous veins is consistent with chronic venous insufficiency, which is a risk factor for venous stasis ulcers. However, venous ulcers are typically not as painful and do not progress as rapidly, and therefore this information may decrease the posterior probability of venous ulcer and keep the probability of pyoderma gangrenosum high, around 60-70%.

So, based on this Bayesian inference, the most likely diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum.",Pyoderma gangrenosum,Y

This history, along with the absence of contractions and the presence of recurrent variable decelerations in fetal heart rate, is highly suggestive of placental abruption, which is when the placenta prematurely detaches from the uterine wall. This condition can compromise fetal blood supply and cause severe maternal bleeding. An additional risk factor for placental abruption is a previous cesarean section.",Placental abruption,N,"The differential for this patient includes: abruptio placentae, uterine rupture, placenta previa, vasa previa, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The sudden onset of vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and loss of contractions in a patient with a history of cesarean delivery is suggestive of uterine rupture. Abruptio placentae would be accompanied by painful contractions and coagulopathy. Placenta previa and vasa previa would be associated with painless bleeding.

She has a history of previous cesarean delivery, which is a significant risk factor for placental abnormalities in subsequent pregnancies. Her current symptoms, especially coupled with the recurrent variable decelerations in fetal heart rate, suggest abruptio placentae. This condition is characterized by premature separation of the placenta from the uterus, leading to a compromise in fetal blood supply and severe abdominal pain in the mother. Hence, the most probable diagnosis is abruptio placentae.",Abruptio placentae,N,"This patient's presentation of vaginal bleeding, cessation of contractions, and severe abdominal pain in the setting of a previous cesarean delivery is concerning for placental abruption. Moreover, recurrent variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate suggest acute fetal distress, which is often seen in placental abruption. Uterine contractions may cause shearing forces that separate the placenta from the uterine wall, which can be worsened by a previous scar in the uterus from a cesarean section. This may lead to bleeding (hemorrhage) and deprivation of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus, leading to fetal distress.",Placental abruption,N,"The prior probability of placental abruption in a typical pregnancy might be around 1%. However, in this patient, the sudden onset of vaginal bleeding and abdominal pain raises the probability to 20%.

The fact that she reports extreme pain during a straight leg raise test is indicative of nerve root irritation. This presentation is very typical of a herniated lumbar disc, which can irritate nearby nerve roots, leading to the symptoms described as radicular pain or sciatica (radiating pain along the course of a spinal nerve due to inflammation or mechanical irritation). Other symptoms can include numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness in the affected leg.

However, the sudden onset of pain during exercise, the radiation of the pain down the leg and into the foot, along with the positive straight leg raise test, are classic signs of a lumbar disc herniation. The straight leg raise test is a common test for lumbar disc herniation, which can cause sciatica. The intact light touch and pin-prick sensation throughout suggests that the nerves are not entirely compromised, which would be more in line with a herniated disc rather than a complete nerve impingement or severe spinal condition. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a herniated disc.",Herniated disc,Y,"The patient presents with sudden-onset lower back pain that is radiating down the side of her leg and into her foot, symptoms that are typically associated with sciatica. Sciatica is often caused by irritation of the root(s) of the lower lumbar and lumbosacral spine. The pain typically increases with maneuvers such as a straight leg raise test that stretch the sciatic nerve, suggesting nerve root compression, commonly caused by a lumbar disc herniation.

While she did go camping recently and another member fell ill, her stool test results are normal, which suggests she didn't pick up a bacterial, parasitic, or viral infection from that experience. In addition, her blood test results do not indicate an infection or inflammation. IBS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes for the symptoms have been ruled out. In this case, her symptoms and the absence of other indicators of illness align with a diagnosis of IBS.",Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Y,"The differential diagnoses for a patient presenting with chronic diarrhea and abdominal discomfort include irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), infection (such as giardia from the camping trip), celiac disease, and microscopic colitis.

Since she has chronic diarrhea that's been going on for the past four months, along with lower abdominal discomfort and cramping that is relieved by episodes of diarrhea, this is suggestive of IBS. IBS often presents with a sensation of urgency, mucus discharge, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation after bowel movements, all of which this patient is experiencing. Moreover, her laboratory investigations do not suggest an inflammatory condition; her ESR is normal, and her WBC count, while slightly elevated, does not specify whether it is a response to a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection.

Infections like giardia would be a consideration given her history of camping. However, giardiasis typically presents with watery, sometimes foul-smelling diarrhea, and is often associated with symptoms such as bloating, flatulence, and weight loss. Since she hasn't lost weight, and the other member of her camping party just fell ill recently (whereas her symptoms have been present for months), it is less likely to be an infectious cause.

Celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease often present with weight loss, and may have signs of malabsorption and nutrient deficiencies, none of which are apparent here. The stool examination was normal, which makes these less likely.

Microscopic colitis could also cause chronic diarrhea, but it often occurs in older patients, and is typically associated with autoimmune disorders, which she does not appear to have.

Therefore, based on her symptoms and the results of the lab tests, irritable bowel syndrome seems to be the most likely diagnosis.",Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Y,"This patient's chronic diarrhea, lower abdominal discomfort relieved by bowel movements, sensation of urgency and incomplete evacuation, and mucus discharge are characteristic of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is a functional bowel disorder and has a criteria of symptoms lasting for at least 3 days a month in the past 3 months.

These symptoms are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), particularly given the lack of weight change and unremarkable physical exam. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and bowel habit changes that are not explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. It's worth noting that the camping trip and illness in the group may raise suspicions about a potential infectious cause, but the normal routine stool examination helps rule this out. The slightly elevated WBC count may indicate some inflammation, but it is not significantly high enough to strongly suggest an infectious or inflammatory cause. The normal ESR further supports this conclusion. As the symptoms have been present for more than three months, it fulfills the Rome IV criteria for IBS.",Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in a relatively young, female patient presenting with chronic diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and associated symptoms such as urgency, mucus discharge, and feeling of incomplete evacuation could be around 10%.

Furthermore, the symptom relief with defecation and lack of nocturnal symptoms further increase the posterior probability of IBS to about 60%. The fact that laboratory studies are unremarkable (including stool examination and blood tests) is common in IBS and can increase the likelihood to 70%. Despite the history of camping and another ill individual, the patient's chronic symptomatology and absence of specific pathogenic indicators or alarm symptoms (e.g., weight loss, fever, blood in stools) reduce the likelihood of infectious causes. In this context, the patient most likely has irritable bowel syndrome.",Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Y

Abdominal ultrasound shows thickening of the bile ducts and focal bile duct dilatation. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Y,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Y,Primary biliary cirrhosis,N,Primary biliary cirrhosis,N,Primary biliary cirrhosis,N,Y,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of a cholestatic liver disease, characterized by fatigue, pruritus, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level. Scleral icterus and the findings on the abdominal ultrasound further point to a problem with bile flow. The history of ulcerative colitis is important because it is associated with a particular liver condition - Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. The presence of thickened and dilated bile ducts on ultrasound is a common finding in PSC. Other potential causes of a cholestatic pattern of liver injury (eg, viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis) are less likely given the negative antinuclear antibodies and antimitochondrial antibodies, lack of offending medications, and absence of a more prominent transaminitis.",Answer: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,T,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), hepatitis B or C, alcohol-related liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. Given his symptoms of fatigue and pruritus along with scleral icterus and elevated liver enzymes, a hepatobiliary disorder is likely. The negative anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) results make PBC and autoimmune hepatitis less likely. His history of ulcerative colitis (UC), along with bile duct changes (thickening and dilatation) seen on ultrasound, strongly suggests PSC. PSC is a cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. It is associated with inflammatory bowel disease, especially UC.",Answer: Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presenting symptoms of fatigue, pruritus (itching), and scleral icterus (yellowing of the white part of the eyes) are suggestive of cholestasis, a condition where bile cannot flow from the liver to the duodenum. The laboratory values are consistent with this suspicion: elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin can indicate liver disease and specifically cholestasis. His abdominal ultrasound showing thickening and dilation of the bile ducts further supports this. His history of ulcerative colitis is an important clue as individuals with inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing a condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is characterized by chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and strictures of the bile ducts, and can eventually lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. While Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are typically associated with primary biliary cholangitis (another type of cholestatic liver disease), their absence in this case along with the man's medical history and ultrasound findings supports the diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.",Answer: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of increasing generalized fatigue, severe pruritus, scleral icterus, and abnormal liver function tests (high alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT) along with evidence of bile duct thickening and dilatation on abdominal ultrasound suggest cholestatic liver disease. His history of ulcerative colitis is an important clue as this condition is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an autoimmune cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation, fibrosis, and stricturing of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. The elevated alkaline phosphatase, a cholestatic liver enzyme, is a common finding in PSC. Antimitochondrial antibodies are often associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, another cholestatic liver disease, but are negative in this case, which is consistent with the more likely diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis.",Answer: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,Y,"Rationale:

Step 1: Start with the prior probability. The prior probability of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in a random person is very low, given it's a rare disease, estimated at less than 1%.

Step 2: Condition on the patient's history of ulcerative colitis. Studies have shown that the risk of PSC is significantly increased in patients with ulcerative colitis, raising the posterior probability to around 5%.

Step 3: Factor in the current symptoms. The patient presents with generalized fatigue, severe pruritus, and scleral icterus, which are symptoms consistent with PSC, which could elevate the posterior probability to around 20%.

Step 4: Account for laboratory and imaging findings. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, specifically alkaline phosphatase, and ultrasound imaging shows thickening and dilation of the bile ducts. These findings further support a diagnosis of PSC, increasing the posterior probability to perhaps 80%.

Step 5: Consider that other common liver conditions were ruled out. Tests for anti-nuclear antibody and antimitochondrial antibodies were negative, which rules out autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis respectively. This further increases the posterior probability of PSC to, say, 95%.

In summary, considering all these factors, this patient likely has primary sclerosing cholangitis.",Answer: Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,Y

"A 40-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with a 5-month history of worsening bladder discomfort. Her discomfort is relieved by voiding. She voids 10–15 times per day and wakes up 2–3 times per night to void. She has not had any involuntary loss of urine. She has tried cutting down on fluids and taking NSAIDs to reduce the discomfort with minimal relief. Her past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder. She is sexually active with her husband but reports that intercourse has recently become painful. Current medications include lithium. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. Examination shows tenderness to palpation of her suprapubic region. Urinalysis shows:

A pelvic ultrasound shows a postvoid residual urine is 25 mL. A cystoscopy shows a normal urethra and normal bladder mucosa. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Interstitial cystitis,Interstitial cystitis,Y,Overactive bladder.,N,Overactive bladder,N,Interstitial cystitis,Y,Interstitial cystitis,Y,,"Rationale: This 40-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening bladder discomfort, which is relieved by voiding, and increased frequency of urination (both during the day and at night), without any involuntary loss of urine. She has also found intercourse to be recently painful. A urinary tract infection can be ruled out as there is no evidence of infection on urinalysis (no white blood cells, bacteria, or positive leukocyte esterase). The postvoid residual urine volume is normal, indicating that she doesn't have an obstructive pathology or issue with bladder emptying. Lastly, a cystoscopy reveals normal urethra and bladder mucosa. These clinical features along with the negative workup suggest a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis, a chronic condition causing bladder pressure, bladder pain and sometimes pelvic pain, commonly in middle-aged women.",Answer: Interstitial cystitis,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes urinary tract infection (UTI), overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, bladder stones, urinary incontinence, or a side effect from her lithium medication. The UTI and stones can be ruled out due to the absence of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, WBCs, and bacteria on urinalysis. Overactive bladder is usually associated with an urge to urinate but not pain, so it's less likely. Urinary incontinence typically presents with involuntary urine loss, which is not reported in this case. Lithium can cause polyuria, but this is not usually associated with bladder discomfort or pain. Lastly, interstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, is a chronic condition causing bladder pressure, bladder pain and sometimes pelvic pain, which can be relieved by voiding. Interstitial cystitis also can result in dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), which fits the patient's symptoms. Therefore, given the symptom profile and the findings from the investigations, the most likely diagnosis is interstitial cystitis.",Answer: Interstitial cystitis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with interstitial cystitis (IC). Interstitial cystitis, also known as painful bladder syndrome, is a chronic condition characterized by pain associated with the bladder, typically relieved upon voiding. Classic symptoms include increased urinary frequency and urgency without evidence of urinary tract infection, which we can see from the normal urinalysis and negative leukocyte esterase in this case. Painful intercourse (dyspareunia) is also a common symptom in interstitial cystitis. The fact that her symptoms are not relieved by reducing fluid intake or NSAIDs, along with the absence of other pathologies on imaging and cystoscopy, helps confirm the diagnosis.",Answer: Interstitial cystitis,Y,"Rationale:This patient's frequent urination, nocturia, suprapubic pain, and dyspareunia in the absence of urinary tract infection or other apparent urinary abnormalities is suggestive of interstitial cystitis (IC). IC, also known as bladder pain syndrome, is a condition resulting in recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and the surrounding pelvic region. The symptoms of IC vary greatly from person to person but may include increased urinary frequency, urgency, and bladder pressure or pain. The pain typically improves upon voiding, a characteristic feature noted in this patient's presentation. The pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) is also a common symptom in women with IC. The cystoscopy finding in IC is typically normal or nonspecific, as seen in this patient. It's important to note that IC is a diagnosis of exclusion, made after ruling out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.",Answer: Interstitial cystitis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of interstitial cystitis (IC) in the general population is quite low, roughly 2-7%. However, when we consider the patient's symptoms, the likelihood of IC increases.

The patient's symptom of bladder discomfort that's relieved by voiding increases the probability to about 20%. It's worth noting that this symptom alone isn't conclusive, as it's shared by other urinary conditions such as urinary tract infection (UTI) or bladder stones. However, the negative urinalysis suggests that UTI is less likely, and the normal cystoscopy implies that bladder stones are not present.

The high frequency of urination, both during the day and night, raises the probability of IC further to about 35%. While frequent urination can also be a symptom of conditions like diabetes or bladder overactivity, the absence of glucose in the urinalysis makes diabetes less probable.

The patient's experience of painful intercourse (dyspareunia) further increases the probability to about 60%. This symptom, while not exclusive to IC, is a common finding in IC patients and is not typically present in most other urinary disorders.

The final significant piece of evidence is the tenderness in the suprapubic region, which points to a bladder-originating problem and further increases the posterior probability of IC to about 75%.

Given the array of symptoms described, their common association with IC, and the exclusion of other potential diagnoses by testing, this patient most likely has interstitial cystitis.",Answer: Interstitial cystitis,Y
"A 55-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with a 2-month history of insidious onset of left shoulder pain. It only occurs at the extremes of her range of motion and has made it difficult to sleep on the affected side. She has noticed increasing difficulty with activities of daily living, including brushing her hair and putting on or taking off her blouse and bra. She denies a history of shoulder trauma, neck pain, arm/hand weakness, numbness, or paresthesias. Her medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which she takes metformin and glipizide. Her physical examination reveals a marked decrease in both active and passive range of motion of the left shoulder, with forwarding flexion to 75°, abduction to 75°, external rotation to 45°, and internal rotation to 15° with significant pain. Rotator cuff strength is normal. AP, scapular Y, and axillary plain film radiographs are reported as normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Adhesive capsulitis,Adhesive capsulitis,Y,Adhesive capsulitis,Y,Adhesive capsulitis,Y,Adhesive capsulitis,Y,Adhesive capsulitis,Y,,"Rationale: The woman's main complaint is of persistent shoulder pain that has worsened over time and restricted her range of motion. The pain occurs at the extremes of motion and impacts her sleep and daily activities. This type of gradual onset, along with difficulty in performing overhead activities, is suggestive of a joint issue. Also, the fact that she has a decrease in both active and passive range of motion indicates that it's not a muscular issue (as in a rotator cuff problem) but rather one that's affecting the joint itself. The X-ray results indicate that there isn't any visible joint abnormality or bone issue. The pain without preceding trauma, the restriction of both active and passive motion, and the lack of radiographic findings suggest adhesive capsulitis, also known as ""frozen shoulder."" This condition is often seen in individuals with diabetes, which this woman has.",Answer: Adhesive capsulitis,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: rotator cuff tear, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, cervical radiculopathy, and shoulder impingement syndrome. The fact that there is a marked decrease in both active and passive range of motion, and pain at the extremes of motion without a history of shoulder trauma or radiographic abnormalities suggest adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder. Rotator cuff tear would typically present with weakness and pain, but she has normal rotator cuff strength. Arthritis typically shows changes on imaging, which is not present in this case. Cervical radiculopathy would typically cause neck pain, numbness or weakness which she denies. Lastly, impingement syndrome is typically associated with pain during overhead activities, which isn't her primary complaint. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes is also relevant, as adhesive capsulitis is more common in patients with this condition.",Answer: Adhesive Capsulitis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms are suggestive of adhesive capsulitis, also known as ""frozen shoulder."" Key features of this condition include insidious onset of pain, progressive restriction of both active and passive range of motion in the shoulder, and significant discomfort with extremities of movement. It's often associated with conditions that cause systemic inflammation, such as diabetes mellitus, which is present in this case. While both active and passive range of motion are affected in adhesive capsulitis, the strength of the rotator cuff is typically maintained, as noted in this patient. The condition often goes undetected in radiographic studies, as it primarily involves the shoulder capsule and the soft tissues.",Answer: Adhesive capsulitis,Y,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with decreased range of motion in the shoulder joint that is not related to a known injury and is causing pain especially at the extremes of motion. This is not associated with any radiographic abnormalities or strength deficits, which might be expected in conditions such as a rotator cuff tear or shoulder impingement. One condition that can present in this manner, especially in patients with diabetes like this woman, is adhesive capsulitis, also known as ""frozen shoulder."" Adhesive capsulitis is characterized by insidious onset of shoulder stiffness and pain that typically worsens over time before eventually resolving. It's thought to be caused by inflammation and fibrosis of the joint capsule, leading to a progressive loss of both active and passive range of motion. Diabetes is a known risk factor for adhesive capsulitis.",Answer: Adhesive capsulitis,Y,"Rationale: Step 1: Consider the prior probability of a few potential diagnoses: Adhesive capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder) has a prevalence of about 3% in the general population, rotator cuff tear 5%, arthritis 20%, and other shoulder conditions at lower percentages.

Step 2: The patient is a 55-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a risk factor for Adhesive Capsulitis. This might raise the posterior probability of Adhesive Capsulitis from 3% to around 10%.

Step 3: The patient has a gradual onset of left shoulder pain at the extremes of her range of motion and difficulty with activities of daily living. There is no history of trauma, which would lower the likelihood of a traumatic rotator cuff injury. Adhesive Capsulitis typically presents with gradual onset of diffuse shoulder pain and decreased range of motion in all planes, which corresponds with this patient's presentation. This could raise the posterior probability of Adhesive Capsulitis to around 40%.

Step 4: The patient's physical exam findings reveal a decrease in both active and passive range of motion of the shoulder, further increasing the likelihood of Adhesive Capsulitis, which is characterized by these findings, to about 60%.

Step 5: Radiographs are reported as normal. In the early stages of Adhesive Capsulitis, plain radiographs are usually normal. This could increase the probability of Adhesive Capsulitis to 70%.

Conclusion: Based on the Bayesian reasoning and the given information, the most likely diagnosis is Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder).",Answer: Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder),Y
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Since infancy, he has frequently had large-volume stools that are loose and greasy. He was treated for otitis media twice in the past year. He has a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections since birth. He is at the 5th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows softening of the occipital and parietal bones. Scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi are heard throughout both lung fields. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",CFTR gene mutation,Cystic fibrosis,Y,Cystic Fibrosis,Y,Cystic fibrosis,Y,Cystic Fibrosis,Y,Cystic fibrosis,Y,,"Rationale: Step 1: The child's frequent large-volume, loose, and greasy stools are a key symptom indicating malabsorption. This could be caused by a variety of conditions, including cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, or pancreatic insufficiency.

Step 2: His history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and otitis media point towards an issue with his immune system, which could be indicative of cystic fibrosis, a disease known to affect both the respiratory and digestive systems.

Step 3: The fact that the child is at the 5th percentile for height and the 3rd percentile for weight could be due to the malnutrition that is associated with malabsorption, another strong indicator of cystic fibrosis.

Step 4: The findings on the physical examination, particularly the scattered expiratory wheezing and rhonchi heard in the lung fields, are indicative of lung disease, which is a common symptom in children with cystic fibrosis.

Step 5: The softening of the occipital and parietal bones, a condition known as craniotabes, is often seen in children with malabsorption issues due to the lack of adequate nutrients, which is common in cystic fibrosis.

Considering the patient's age, the history of recurrent respiratory infections, malabsorption symptoms, and poor growth, cystic fibrosis is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Cystic Fibrosis.,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, tropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, lactose intolerance, and malabsorption syndromes. However, certain details in this case help narrow down these possibilities. The boy's frequent, large-volume, greasy stools are indicative of steatorrhea, which occurs when the body is unable to properly absorb fat. This could be caused by conditions such as cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, or pancreatic insufficiency. His history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and recent otitis media hint toward an underlying condition that affects his immune response, with cystic fibrosis being a likely suspect.

Cystic fibrosis also matches his stunted growth, which is the 5th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight, as the condition often leads to malnutrition due to fat malabsorption. The softening of his occipital and parietal bones is a sign of rickets, which is caused by vitamin D deficiency - another result of malabsorption seen in cystic fibrosis. Finally, the expiratory wheezing and rhonchi heard throughout both lung fields could be a sign of chronic lung disease, a common symptom in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cystic fibrosis.",Answer: Cystic Fibrosis,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms and findings suggestive of cystic fibrosis. The frequent large-volume, loose, greasy stools indicate malabsorption of fat, which is a characteristic feature of cystic fibrosis. Recurrent respiratory tract infections and wheezing are also common in cystic fibrosis due to impaired mucociliary clearance and chronic airway inflammation. The growth parameters (low height and weight percentiles) are consistent with failure to thrive, which is another manifestation of cystic fibrosis. The softening of the occipital and parietal bones is suggestive of cranial bone thinning, which can occur due to vitamin D deficiency in cystic fibrosis patients.",Answer: Cystic fibrosis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms are indicative of cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. This gene codes for a chloride channel that helps regulate the movement of water and electrolytes in and out of cells, which affects the consistency of the body's secretions. CF commonly presents with recurrent respiratory infections due to abnormally viscous mucus in the airways, making it difficult to clear bacteria and leading to persistent infection and inflammation. The abnormal secretions can also block the ducts of the pancreas, causing malabsorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, which could account for the patient's symptoms of large-volume, greasy stools and poor growth. The softening of the occipital and parietal bones may be due to Vitamin D deficiency as a result of fat malabsorption, leading to rickets.",Answer: Cystic fibrosis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of cystic fibrosis in a child with recurrent respiratory infections and malnutrition might be around 15%. The presence of large-volume, greasy stools points towards malabsorption, a common feature in cystic fibrosis, increasing the posterior probability to about 35%. The fact that the child has been treated for otitis media twice in the past year and has a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections since birth further pushes the probability to around 60%. Finally, softening of the occipital and parietal bones indicates vitamin D deficiency, a common manifestation in cystic fibrosis due to malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins, raising the probability to around 85%. Based on the provided symptoms, the child likely has cystic fibrosis.",Answer: Cystic Fibrosis,Y

"A 23-year-old patient with a past medical history of anxiety and appropriately treated schizophrenia presents to the emergency department for a first time seizure. The patient was at home eating dinner when he began moving abnormally and did not respond to his mother, prompting her to bring him in. His symptoms persisted in the emergency department and were successfully treated with diazepam. The patient is discharged and scheduled for a follow up appointment with neurology the next day for treatment. The patient returns to his neurologist 1 month later for a checkup. Physical exam is notable for carpopedal spasm when his blood pressure is being taken. Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact and his gait is stable. What is the most likely explanation of this patient's current presentation?",P450 induction,Tetany,N,Hypocalcemia,N,Hypocalcemia,N,Hypocalcemia,N,Hypocalcemia,N,,"Rationale: The patient's carpopedal spasm during blood pressure measurement is a positive Trousseau sign, which is suggestive of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular irritability, leading to symptoms such as muscle cramping, spasms, and possibly seizures. Given this patient had a seizure with no other neurological findings and has now exhibited a positive Trousseau sign, hypocalcemia could be the underlying cause.",Answer: Hypocalcemia,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: hypocalcemia, tetany, anxiety, seizure disorder, and extrapyramidal symptoms from antipsychotic medication. The presence of carpopedal spasm is suggestive of hypocalcemia or tetany. This phenomenon can occur during the process of taking blood pressure, known as Trousseau's sign, where the occlusion of the brachial artery with a blood pressure cuff can lead to muscular spasm in patients with hypocalcemia. There is no indication that his antipsychotic treatment, anxiety, or a new onset seizure disorder could be responsible for this finding. Hence, the most likely explanation for this patient's current presentation is hypocalcemia.",Answer: Hypocalcemia,N,"Rationale: The carpopedal spasm described when the blood pressure cuff was inflated is indicative of latent tetany, which can be caused by hypocalcemia. The patient has no other neurological findings, so it is unlikely that his current presentation is due to a new or worsening neurological disease or seizure disorder. Hypocalcemia can cause neuromuscular irritability leading to symptoms such as carpopedal spasm, but it does not typically cause seizures or psychiatric symptoms. Therefore, while it may not explain the initial seizure, it does explain the current presentation.",Answer: Hypocalcemia,N,"Rationale: The patient's current presentation of carpopedal spasm during blood pressure measurement is most likely indicative of latent tetany, a condition often seen in hypocalcemia. This sign, also known as Trousseau's sign, is elicited when occlusion of the brachial artery with a blood pressure cuff leads to a reactive increase in muscular excitability. The neurologic check-up seems normal which is not usually the case if the spasms were due to a CNS disorder or epilepsy. Also, the presentation does not indicate signs of seizures or postictal state. Hypocalcemia itself could be due to various reasons such as vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, or malabsorption syndromes, which can be investigated further. In this case, the patient's psychiatric conditions or medications are not typically associated with hypocalcemia.",Answer: Hypocalcemia,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of hypocalcemia-induced tetany in the general population is quite low (let's assume 1%), but the presence of carpopedal spasm during blood pressure measurement, a sign known as Trousseau's sign, is highly suggestive of this condition, which might increase the posterior probability to 20%. Tetany, such as carpopedal spasm, can be due to hyperventilation, but there is no mention of hyperventilation in the clinical scenario, so the probability remains 20%. Since the patient is not noted to have other obvious causes of hypocalcemia like parathyroid gland issues, Vitamin D deficiency, renal disease, or malnutrition, the posterior probability does not increase further. However, considering the described scenario, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is indeed hypocalcemia, which can occasionally be found in patients without other obvious risk factors.",Answer: Hypocalcemia-induced tetany,N
"A 35-year-old male anesthesiologist presents to the occupational health clinic after a needlestick exposure while obtaining an arterial line in a patient with cirrhosis. In addition to a standard bloodborne pathogen laboratory panel sent for all needlestick exposures at his hospital, additional hepatitis panels are ordered upon the patient's request. The patient's results are shown below:

HIV 4th generation Ag/Ab: Negative/Negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Negative
Hepatitis C antibody: Negative
Anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb): Positive
Anti-hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM): Negative
Anti-hepatitis B core IgG antibody (HBc IgG): Positive

What is the most likely explanation of the results above?",Immune due to infection,Previous exposure to hepatitis B virus.,Y,Vaccinated,N,Past hepatitis B infection.,Y,Previous exposure to hepatitis B virus.,Y,Vaccination,N,,"Rationale: The results indicate that the anesthesiologist has been exposed to hepatitis B in the past, but is currently not infected, as suggested by the negative HBsAg and positive HBsAb and HBc IgG. The Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection, and its presence signifies that the person is infectious. The fact that this is negative means the person does not currently have an active infection.

The Anti-Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) indicates immunity to Hepatitis B. It is positive in this case, which means the person is immune to Hepatitis B, either from past infection or from vaccination.

The Hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM) is the first antibody to appear in response to an acute Hepatitis B infection, usually within 6 weeks after exposure. The fact that it is negative implies the absence of a recent infection.

The Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (HBc IgG) remains positive for life following a Hepatitis B infection, indicating past exposure to the virus. Given that this is positive and the IgM is negative, it means that the exposure to Hepatitis B was not recent.",Answer: Past Hepatitis B infection,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnoses for the serology findings of this patient include:

No past or present infection with hepatitis B.
Past infection with recovery and immunity.
Successful vaccination against hepatitis B.
False positive results.
Let's consider the patient's results one by one:

HIV 4th generation Ag/Ab: Negative/Negative - This means he does not have HIV.

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg): Negative - This indicates there is no active hepatitis B infection.

Hepatitis C antibody: Negative - This indicates there is no past or present infection with hepatitis C.

Anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb): Positive - This indicates that the patient has immunity to hepatitis B. This could be due to a past infection with subsequent recovery or due to successful vaccination.

Anti-hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM): Negative - This indicates that there is no recent hepatitis B infection.

Anti-hepatitis B core IgG antibody (HBc IgG): Positive - This indicates a past hepatitis B infection.

Given that the patient has positive HBsAb and positive HBc IgG with negative HBsAg and negative HBc IgM, the most likely explanation is that he had a past hepatitis B infection from which he recovered and now has immunity.",Answer: Past hepatitis B infection with recovery.,Y,"Rationale: The healthcare worker has experienced a needlestick injury and is understandably concerned about potential transmission of bloodborne viruses, such as HIV, hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). The test results provided give us important information about his immune status.

The negative HIV 4th generation Ag/Ab result means that he is not currently infected with HIV.

For hepatitis B, the negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) result indicates that he does not have an active HBV infection. The positive anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) result means that he has immunity to HBV, likely due to vaccination as the HBsAb is the antibody generated in response to the HBV vaccine.

The positive anti-hepatitis B core IgG antibody (HBc IgG) result is slightly confusing in this context. The presence of anti-HBc IgG typically indicates past exposure to HBV, but it can also be found in individuals vaccinated against HBV. The negative anti-hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM) result indicates that if there was a HBV infection, it's not a recent one (as HBc IgM is typically positive in acute infection).

The negative hepatitis C antibody result indicates that he has not been exposed to HCV.

Given these results, it seems that the healthcare worker has been immunized against HBV (indicated by the positive HBsAb) and does not have an active HBV infection (indicated by the negative HBsAg). The positive HBc IgG result could be due to past exposure or vaccination, but without symptoms or a positive HBsAg result, it is not indicative of an active HBV infection.",Answer: Immunized against Hepatitis B.,Y,"Rationale: These laboratory results suggest that the anesthesiologist has been immunized against hepatitis B. In an immunized person, one would expect to find a negative Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test (indicating that the person is not currently infected), and a positive Anti-hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) test (indicating that the person has immunity). The presence of the Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (HBc IgG) can be confusing, as it generally indicates past exposure to the hepatitis B virus. However, some hepatitis B vaccines contain parts of the hepatitis B core antigen, which could potentially lead to positive HBc IgG results without indicating a past infection.","Answer: Past hepatitis B infection, now immune",Y,"Rationale: The key here is to evaluate the status of the individual's exposure and immunity to Hepatitis B, given the reported laboratory results.

The individual tested negative for the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which means that he is not currently infected with Hepatitis B.

The Hepatitis B core IgM antibody (HBc IgM) result is negative, which indicates that there is no recent infection.

The positive result for the Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (HBc IgG) means that he has been exposed to the virus in the past.

The Hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) is positive, which indicates immunity to Hepatitis B.

Considering all these factors together, the most probable explanation is that the individual was previously infected with Hepatitis B but has since recovered and developed immunity to it.","Answer: Previous Hepatitis B infection, now immune.",Y
"Four days after admission to the hospital for anorexia nervosa, a 20-year-old woman has new-onset palpitations and paresthesias in all four limbs. Prior to admission, she was found unconscious by her parents on the floor of a residential treatment center. The patient was started on a trial of nutritional rehabilitation upon arrival to the hospital. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 47/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg. She is 160 cm tall and weighs 35 kg; BMI is 14 kg/m2. The patient appears emaciated. Examination shows lower leg edema. A 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard over the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. AN ECG shows intermittent supraventricular tachycardia and QTc prolongation. Serum studies show:
Day 2 Day 4
Potassium (mEq/L) 3.5 2.7
Calcium (mg/dL) 8.5 7.8
Magnesium (mEq/L) 1.2 0.5
Phosphorus (mg/dL) 3.6 1.5
What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""",Increased insulin release,Refeeding Syndrome,Y,Electrolyte imbalance,N,Electrolyte imbalance,N,Electrolyte imbalance,N,Refeeding syndrome,Y,,"Rationale: This patient presents with anorexia nervosa and has recently been started on nutritional rehabilitation. Her serum studies show decreasing levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, all of which are important electrolytes in the body. These findings, along with her new-onset symptoms such as palpitations and paresthesias, suggest she may be experiencing refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome is a potentially fatal condition that can occur during nutritional rehabilitation of severely malnourished individuals, due to rapid shifts in electrolytes as the body's metabolism shifts from a catabolic to an anabolic state.",Answer: Refeeding syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The patient's signs and symptoms - palpitations, paresthesias, low BMI, emaciation, lower leg edema, supraventricular tachycardia and QTc prolongation on ECG, as well as the decreases in potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus - are indicative of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome is a potentially lethal condition that can occur during re-nutrition of malnourished patients. The rapid shift from a catabolic to an anabolic state instigates a surge of insulin and decrease in glucagon secretion. This hormonal shift drives potassium, phosphate, and magnesium into the cells, depleting the levels in the bloodstream. Additionally, insulin-driven glucose uptake can exacerbate thiamine deficiency, leading to severe complications. Notably, the patient's presentation of palpitations and paresthesias, her reduced vital parameters, and abnormal ECG findings all point to this electrolyte and mineral imbalance caused by refeeding.",Answer: Refeeding Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: This patient has a history of anorexia nervosa and has recently been started on nutritional rehabilitation, which could increase her risk of developing refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome can occur when nutritional support is given to severely malnourished patients. This condition can lead to electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, which are shown by her serum studies on Day 4. These electrolyte imbalances can cause a variety of complications, including cardiac arrhythmias (as suggested by her new-onset palpitations, and ECG findings), neuromuscular abnormalities (such as paresthesia), and heart failure (as suggested by her lower leg edema and new murmur).",Answer: Refeeding syndrome,Y,"Rationale: This patient is undergoing refeeding for her anorexia nervosa. When a severely malnourished person begins to eat again, the demand for electrolytes by the cells increases significantly as the body starts to produce energy again. This leads to rapid shifts of electrolytes from the blood into the cells, causing a relative deficiency of these electrolytes in the blood, a phenomenon known as refeeding syndrome. The primary feature of refeeding syndrome is hypophosphatemia, as seen in this patient. Hypophosphatemia can lead to cardiac dysfunction, such as the QTc prolongation seen on this patient's ECG. The low potassium and magnesium values on day 4 further support this diagnosis, as these electrolytes are also commonly depleted during refeeding. The syndrome can also cause edema due to shifts in fluid balance, which may be the cause of this patient's lower leg edema.",Answer: Refeeding syndrome.,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a known case of anorexia nervosa and has been admitted for the same. In such patients, when nutritional rehabilitation is started, there can be a sudden shift of electrolytes and fluid which can lead to a syndrome called refeeding syndrome.

Refeeding syndrome is characterized by severe electrolyte and fluid shifts and can cause serious complications, including cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure. This is often seen in malnourished patients when they are started on nutritional supplementation.

The prior probability of Refeeding Syndrome for a patient with anorexia nervosa undergoing nutritional rehabilitation could be around 10%.

On Day 4, she exhibits new-onset palpitations, paresthesias, low pulse, low blood pressure, and edema - symptoms that indicate possible refeeding syndrome. This shifts the probability of Refeeding Syndrome to around 40%.

Furthermore, her ECG changes, including supraventricular tachycardia and QTc prolongation, are also consistent with electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, increasing the probability to 60%.

Lastly, the patient's laboratory results on Day 4 reveal significant decreases in potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels - all consistent with electrolyte shifts seen in Refeeding Syndrome. This further increases the posterior probability of Refeeding Syndrome to about 90%.",Answer: Refeeding Syndrome.,Y
"A 17-year-old boy comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of pain in his left wrist. That morning the pain increased and he started to have chills and malaise. Last week he had self-resolving left knee pain. He is otherwise healthy and has not had any trauma to the wrist. He recently returned from a camping trip to Minnesota. He is sexually active with one female partner, who uses a diaphragm for contraception. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F). Examination shows several painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on the dorsum of both wrists and hands; two lesions are present on the left palm. There is swelling and erythema of the left wrist with severe tenderness to palpation and passive movement. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated gonococcal infection,Lyme Disease,N,Lyme disease,N,Lyme disease,N,Lyme disease,N,Lyme disease,N,,"Rationale: This patient's history of travel to Minnesota, a state known to be endemic for ticks, combined with his recent camping trip, are suggestive of exposure to ticks. The painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on his hands and wrists may represent erythema migrans, a characteristic rash associated with Lyme disease. Additionally, his migratory joint pain (initially in the knee, now in the wrist) is another classic symptom of Lyme disease. Lastly, his generalized symptoms of malaise and chills can be seen in early disseminated Lyme disease.",Answer: Lyme disease,N,"The differential for this patient includes: reactive arthritis, gout, Lyme disease, bacterial or viral infection, and sexually transmitted infections such as gonococcal arthritis. The camping trip to Minnesota, a known endemic area, raises suspicion for Lyme disease, but he lacks a classic erythema migrans rash. The appearance of vesiculopustular lesions, however, along with wrist pain and recent sexual activity with a single partner, suggests gonococcal arthritis, which often manifests with a triad of dermatitis, tenosynovitis, and migratory polyarthralgia. Gonococcal arthritis should be suspected in sexually active young adults with monoarticular or oligoarticular arthritis. This patient most likely has gonococcal arthritis.",Answer: Gonococcal arthritis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of migrating polyarthralgia, fever, and vesiculopustular skin lesions suggest a diagnosis of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). This is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and typically affects sexually active individuals. This patient's sexual history and her partner's use of a diaphragm (which is not effective against STIs) support the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection. DGI often presents as a migratory polyarthralgia or polyarthritis, typically with associated fever and chills, as well as the distinctive skin lesions described.",Answer: Disseminated gonococcal infection,Y,"Rationale: The patient's history of a camping trip in Minnesota, a region where Lyme disease is prevalent, along with the symptoms of migrating joint pain, suggests that he might be suffering from Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which can cause a variety of symptoms including fever, chills, malaise, and arthritis. Although the classic ""bull's eye"" rash (erythema migrans) is not mentioned, it only appears in approximately 70-80% of infected individuals and its absence does not rule out the disease. The violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on his hands and wrists could suggest a concomitant infection with a sexually transmitted disease such as secondary syphilis, however, the joint pain and history of exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area make this less likely.",Answer: Lyme disease,N,"Rationale: In this scenario, we can approach the Bayesian inference analysis in a similar fashion. We can start by setting a prior probability of Lyme disease, given the symptoms and circumstances that we are presented with. Let's set it at 10% initially because the symptoms are relatively non-specific.

However, there are clues in the description that would significantly increase the posterior probability. First, the patient was camping in Minnesota, which is a known endemic area for Lyme disease. This increases the probability to 30%.

Second, the patient presents with a migrating musculoskeletal pain (left knee pain followed by left wrist pain), which is a common presentation of Lyme disease. This further increases the probability to 50%.

Third, the presence of painless violaceous vesiculopustular lesions on the dorsum of both wrists and hands could be suggestive of erythema migrans, a common sign of Lyme disease. This bumps the probability up to 70%.

Finally, his constitutional symptoms, including fever and malaise, are consistent with early disseminated Lyme disease, bringing the final posterior probability up to 80%. Therefore, it is most likely that the patient is suffering from Lyme disease.",Answer: Lyme disease,N
"A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by paramedics following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The patient complains of excruciating chest pain, which he describes as tearing. Further history reveals that the patient is healthy, taking no medications, and is not under the influence of drugs or alcohol. On physical examination, his heart rate is 97/min. His blood pressure is 95/40 mm Hg in the right arm and 60/30 mm Hg in the left arm. Pulses are absent in the right leg and diminished in the left. A neurological examination is normal. A chest X-ray reveals a widened mediastinum. What is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition?",Traumatic aortic dissection,Aortic dissection,Y,Aortic dissection,Y,Aortic dissection,Y,Aortic dissection,Y,Aortic dissection,Y,,"Rationale: The history of a high-speed motor vehicle collision and the severe, tearing chest pain described by this patient immediately bring to mind a traumatic injury to the chest. The fact that the patient has a significant discrepancy in blood pressure between the two arms, along with absent pulses in the right leg and diminished pulses in the left, suggests an interruption in the flow of blood, likely due to a vascular injury. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray is consistent with an aortic dissection, which is a tear in the wall of the aorta that allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall. This can result in diminished or absent pulses and different blood pressures in the arms or legs if the dissection extends to the branches of the aorta that supply these areas. Thus, an aortic dissection is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition.",Answer: Aortic dissection,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnoses for this patient include: aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, pneumothorax, and traumatic injury to the chest (such as rib fractures or lung contusion). The presence of a tearing chest pain, the discrepancy in blood pressures between the right and left arm, and the absence of pulses in the right leg are highly suggestive of aortic dissection. Aortic dissection often presents with severe chest pain that is described as ""tearing"" or ""ripping,"" and it can cause differences in blood pressure between arms or between arms and legs if the dissection extends into the arteries supplying those areas.

This is a condition where a tear develops in the inner layer of the aorta, causing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart. In this case, the tear seems to be in the ascending aorta or the aortic arch, which can affect the blood flow to the left arm and lower extremities, explaining the difference in blood pressures and the diminished pulses. The widened mediastinum on chest X-ray is a classic sign of aortic dissection.",Answer: Aortic dissection.,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of an aortic dissection is 1% in the general population. The patient's complaint of chest pain that he describes as ""tearing"" can be highly suggestive of aortic dissection, which would increase the posterior probability to 30%.

"A 32-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her obstetrician for a prenatal visit. She is 30 weeks pregnant. She reports some fatigue and complains of urinary urgency. Prior to this pregnancy, she had no significant medical history. She takes a prenatal vitamin and folate supplements daily. Her mother has diabetes, and her brother has coronary artery disease. On physical examination, the fundal height is 25 centimeters. A fetal ultrasound shows a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s presentation?",Rubella infection,Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),N,Intrauterine growth restriction,N,Intrauterine growth restriction,N,Intrauterine growth restriction.,N,Intrauterine growth restriction,N,,"Rationale: This patient is a 32-year-old pregnant woman at 30 weeks gestation presenting with fatigue, urinary urgency, and a fundal height that is lower than what would be expected at this point in her pregnancy (it should match her gestational age in weeks). The ultrasound findings show a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length which suggests symmetric fetal growth restriction. This generally suggests a long-standing issue has affected the growth of the fetus. Given that the patient's mother has diabetes, it's possible that the patient might also have undiagnosed gestational diabetes, which can sometimes result in growth restriction in the fetus if poorly controlled.",Answer: Gestational diabetes.,N,"Rationale: In this case, the differential diagnoses for reduced fetal size include intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), congenital infections, and chromosomal abnormalities. IUGR can be a result of placental insufficiency, maternal malnutrition, maternal illnesses (such as hypertension or diabetes), or certain medications. Congenital infections that can lead to reduced fetal size include TORCH infections (Toxoplasmosis, Other agents, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex). Certain chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome, can also result in smaller babies.

This patient presents with a proportional reduction in fetal size (head circumference, trunk, and limbs), which is more consistent with constitutional growth delay (the baby is small but proportional), rather than a specific cause such as a congenital infection or chromosomal abnormalities which often present with certain specific features.

Furthermore, the patient doesn't mention any symptoms suggestive of an infection nor any risk factors for chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., advanced maternal age). There's no mention of significant maternal disease, drug use, or malnutrition. However, it's mentioned that the patient's mother has diabetes and her brother has coronary artery disease. These familial factors could hint towards a genetic predisposition for metabolic issues which could impact fetal growth.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is constitutional growth delay due to genetic factors.",Answer: Genetic factors.,N,"Rationale: This patient's prenatal examination at 30 weeks gestation shows a fundal height that is less than expected (25 cm instead of the expected 30 cm, approximately). The ultrasound also reveals a proportionally smaller fetus. These findings suggest intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), a condition that can be caused by multiple factors, such as maternal, fetal, or placental abnormalities. Given this woman's family history of diabetes and the fact that she is experiencing symptoms of urinary urgency and fatigue, it is possible that she could have undiagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Although most women with GDM have macrosomic infants, it can occasionally lead to IUGR if there is concomitant placental insufficiency.",Answer: Gestational diabetes mellitus,N,"Rationale: The key findings in this case are the woman's pregnancy with a fundal height lower than expected for gestational age and a proportional reduction in all fetal measurements. This indicates that the fetus is smaller than average for its gestational age, known as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The cause for this can vary widely. Common causes of IUGR include chronic diseases in the mother (such as hypertension or kidney disease), infections during pregnancy, malnutrition, placental issues, and more. However, given the absence of any other concerning signs, symptoms or history in this case (like hypertension, signs of infection, substance use, etc.), and given the fact that the patient's mother has diabetes, it's reasonable to suspect that this patient may have undiagnosed gestational diabetes. Although fatigue and urinary urgency can be normal in pregnancy, they are also symptoms of diabetes. The fetus of a mother with uncontrolled diabetes is at a higher risk for macrosomia (being overly large). However, if the diabetes leads to vascular complications and impaired placental blood flow, this can cause IUGR. Therefore, considering the family history and symptoms, it is possible that undiagnosed gestational diabetes leading to placental insufficiency might be causing the IUGR in this case.",Answer: Gestational diabetes,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in this patient is approximately 3% given the prevalence in the general population. However, the mother is presenting with a fundal height (25 cm) that is less than expected for her gestational age (30 weeks), which increases the posterior probability of IUGR to around 25%. Further, the ultrasound showing a proportional reduction in head circumference, trunk size, and limb length increases the probability of IUGR to over 50%, as these are typical findings in cases of symmetric IUGR. This type of IUGR often suggests an early pregnancy or genetic cause. There is no significant medical history or medication use that would suggest another cause for these findings.",Answer: Intrauterine growth restriction,N
"A 71-year-old male presents to the emergency department after having a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. His son reports that he does not have a history of seizures but has had increasing confusion and weakness over the last several weeks. An electrolyte panel reveals a sodium level of 120 mEq/L and a serum osmolality of 248 mOsm/kg. His urine is found to have a high urine osmolality. His temperature is 37° C (98.6° F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/88 mm Hg. On examination he is disoriented, his pupils are round and reactive to light and accommodation and his mucous membranes are moist. His heart has a regular rhythm without murmurs, his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, the abdomen is soft, and his extremities have no edema but his muscular strength is 3/5 bilaterally. There is hyporeflexia of all four extremities. What is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone  SIADH ,Hyponatremia,N,SIADH,Y,Hyponatremia,N,Hyponatremia,N,Hyponatremia,N,,"Rationale: This patient presents with confusion, weakness, and a seizure, all of which can be associated with hyponatremia, or low sodium levels in the blood, which his lab results confirm. His high urine osmolality indicates that his kidneys are appropriately concentrating his urine in response to the perceived low sodium levels in his body, pointing towards a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) rather than a primary renal problem. This condition is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland or another source, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. Furthermore, the lack of any signs of volume depletion (like dry mucous membranes or low blood pressure) or volume overload (like edema or an elevated blood pressure) in the physical examination further supports a euvolemic hyponatremia like SIADH.",Answer: Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH),Y,"The differential for this patient includes: hyponatremic encephalopathy, cerebral vascular accident (stroke), brain tumor, metabolic encephalopathy, and seizure disorder. The laboratory results reveal a low serum sodium (hyponatremia) and high urine osmolality, which indicates that the body is improperly retaining water and excreting sodium - a condition known as Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH). This could be caused by various conditions like lung disease, CNS disorders, or certain medications, but the fact that no specific cause is mentioned in the history makes it less likely. The presence of neurological symptoms like confusion, weakness, and seizures, in conjunction with hyponatremia, aligns well with the diagnosis of hyponatremic encephalopathy. Other findings like normal mucous membranes (indicating adequate hydration status) and normal heart and lung examination findings further support this. It's also important to mention that the generalized weakness, disorientation, and seizures can be due to severe hyponatremia. Therefore, based on the provided information, the patient's symptoms are most likely caused by hyponatremic encephalopathy.",Answer: Hyponatremic encephalopathy.,N,"Rationale: This patient presents with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, confusion, weakness, disorientation, and a low serum sodium level with a high urine osmolality. These findings are suggestive of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is a condition where the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in water retention and low sodium levels (hyponatremia). This leads to an increased volume of urine that is highly concentrated. The confusion, disorientation, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia, while the generalized muscle weakness and hyporeflexia are signs of neurological impairment due to the electrolyte imbalance.",Answer: Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH),Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is suggestive of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This syndrome can be due to multiple causes, such as medications, lung disease, or central nervous system disorders, among others. The patient is hyponatremic (sodium level of 120 mEq/L) and hypo-osmolar (serum osmolality of 248 mOsm/kg) as would be expected in SIADH. The elevated urine osmolality is consistent with continued ADH activity causing water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, leading to concentrated urine despite the low serum osmolality. The hyponatremia could be the cause of his seizures, as low sodium levels can lead to neuronal edema and increased intracranial pressure, which can cause both seizures and the mental status changes seen in this patient. In addition, his generalized weakness and hyporeflexia could be associated with severe hyponatremia, due to effects on muscle excitability.",Answer: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH),Y,"Rationale: Starting with a prior probability, the likelihood of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH) in the general population is low, let's assume it to be around 1%. SIADH is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or another source, leading to water retention, hyponatremia, and hypo-osmolality.

The patient's lab results show a low serum sodium (120 mEq/L, normal range: 135-145 mEq/L), which increases the posterior probability of SIADH to 20%. In addition to hyponatremia, the patient also has a low serum osmolality (248 mOsm/kg, normal range: 275-295 mOsm/kg), which further increases the probability to 40%. SIADH also manifests as a concentrated urine with high urine osmolality despite the low serum osmolality. This patient's high urine osmolality further increases the probability of SIADH to 70%.

Clinical signs of hyponatremia include confusion, seizures, weakness, and in severe cases, coma, which this patient has been experiencing, increasing the likelihood of SIADH to 80%.

Given this patient's presentation, lab findings, and the increase in probability at each step, it is most likely that this patient has SIADH.",Answer: Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH),Y
"A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with palpitations, sweating, and blurry vision after playing volleyball on the beach. She denies chest pain and shortness of breath. She states that these episodes occur often, but resolve after eating a meal or drinking a sugary soda. Past medical history is unremarkable, and she takes no medications. Temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 18/min. Fingerstick blood glucose level is 42 g/dL. ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Urinalysis and toxicology are noncontributory. Appropriate medical therapy is administered and she is discharged with an appointment for a fasting blood draw within the week.

What is the most likely cause of this patient’s hypoglycemia?",Beta cell tumor of the pancreas,Insulinoma,Y,Insulinoma,Y,Insulinoma,Y,Insulinoma,Y,Insulinoma,Y,,"Rationale: This patient is experiencing symptoms of hypoglycemia (sweating, palpitations, blurry vision), that resolve with consumption of glucose-rich foods and drinks. Her glucose level was found to be low during one of these episodes and also during a fasting blood test. Simultaneously, her insulin levels and C-peptide levels are found to be elevated, indicating excess endogenous insulin production as the cause of her hypoglycemia. Proinsulin levels are normal, ruling out an insulinoma, which typically secretes both insulin and proinsulin. The negative test for sulfonylurea and IGF-2 rules out sulfonylurea use (a type of diabetes medication that can cause hypoglycemia) and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia respectively. Given this data, the most likely cause is an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumor called an insulinoma, which secretes insulin, leading to low blood sugar levels, and c-peptide, but not proinsulin.",Answer: Insulinoma.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes insulinoma, exogenous insulin use, sulfonylurea use, non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia, and autoimmune hypoglycemia. This patient's symptoms of hypoglycemia improving with consumption of food or sugary drink is suggestive of insulin-mediated hypoglycemia. Her labs reveal elevated insulin and C-peptide levels, while sulfonylurea and IGF-2 are negative, which rules out sulfonylurea use and non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia. Exogenous insulin use would result in high insulin but low C-peptide level which is not the case here. This patient's presentation and lab results are most consistent with insulinoma, a tumor of the pancreatic islet cells that leads to overproduction of insulin.",Answer: Insulinoma.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, and blurry vision which resolve after eating or drinking a sugary beverage, coupled with hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 70 mg/dL) suggests that she has been experiencing hypoglycemic episodes. Additionally, her symptoms present when she is engaging in prolonged physical activity, such as volleyball, which can further lower blood glucose. Her lab results show an elevated insulin level and an elevated C-peptide level in the presence of low blood glucose, which suggests endogenous hyperinsulinism, as both insulin and C-peptide are co-secreted by the pancreas in response to a high blood glucose level. Importantly, her sulfonylurea test is negative, ruling out medication as a cause of the increased insulin levels. Furthermore, her serum proinsulin is within normal limits, suggesting that her hyperinsulinism is not due to a proinsulin-secreting tumor (such as insulinoma, where proinsulin is usually elevated). This leaves the possibility of an insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cell tumor or hyperplasia, but these typically produce elevated proinsulin levels. However, the normal proinsulin levels might suggest a diagnosis of noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS), a rare cause of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia resulting from diffuse beta-cell hyperfunction.",Answer: Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome.,N,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of palpitations, sweating, and blurred vision, which improve after consuming a meal or sugary drink, are suggestive of hypoglycemia. Her labs confirm hypoglycemia with elevated insulin and C-peptide levels. Insulinoma, an insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreatic islets, is a common cause of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in adults. The increase in insulin will lead to hypoglycemia, and the increased insulin also leads to an increase in C-peptide, which is a byproduct of insulin production. Sulfonylureas, a class of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, can also cause hypoglycemia, but a sulfonylurea test was negative, making it unlikely to be the cause. IGF-2 can cause non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia, but it is also negative in this case. Therefore, the most likely cause of her hypoglycemia is an insulinoma.",Answer: Insulinoma,Y,"Rationale: Starting with a prior probability of endogenous hyperinsulinemia (which includes insulinoma as one of its common causes) at around 30%, considering this patient's episodes of hypoglycemia after physical activity and relief with food, we can increase the posterior probability to around 50%. The finding of a low blood glucose level (45 mg/dL) raises the probability to 60%. A higher than normal level of serum insulin at 20 microU/L (with normal being less than 6 microU/L) raises the probability further to around 80%. Additionally, a high C-peptide level at 0.8 nmol/L (normal being less than 0.2 nmol/L) in the context of hypoglycemia and elevated insulin suggests insulin secretion from beta cells of the pancreas, raising the probability to around 90%. The findings of a negative sulfonylurea and negative IGF-2 tests rule out other causes of hypoglycemia, making the diagnosis of insulinoma, a tumor of the beta cells of the pancreas, highly likely. This pushes the posterior probability to around 95%.",Answer: Insulinoma,Y
"Blood cultures are sent to the laboratory. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is started. Transesophageal echocardiography shows a large, oscillating vegetation attached to the tricuspid valve. There are multiple small vegetations attached to tips of the tricuspid valve leaflets. There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The left side of the heart and the ejection fraction are normal. What is the most likely causal organism of this patient's conditions?",Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus aureus,Y,Staphylococcus aureus,Y,Staphylococcus aureus,Y,Staphylococcus aureus,Y,Streptococcus viridans,N,,"Rationale: This patient has a vegetation on the tricuspid valve, which is an indication of endocarditis. Tricuspid valve endocarditis is typically associated with intravenous drug use. Among people who inject drugs, Staphylococcus aureus is the most common causative organism of infective endocarditis. Therefore, given the presentation, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely causative organism.",Answer: Staphylococcus aureus.,Y,"Rationale: The organisms that typically cause endocarditis can be divided into a few categories: viridans group streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and the HACEK group of organisms. In intravenous drug users or individuals with indwelling intravenous catheters, the most common organism is Staphylococcus aureus. The clinical scenario described does not give any indication of drug use or the presence of an indwelling catheter. Viridans group streptococci typically affect damaged or abnormal heart valves. Enterococci typically cause infection in individuals who have had previous genitourinary or gastrointestinal procedures. The HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella) is a less common cause of endocarditis. Given that this patient's infection is isolated to the tricuspid valve and there are no other specifics given, it is hard to pinpoint the most likely causal organism without more information. However, Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common causes of infective endocarditis overall, and it can affect the tricuspid valve.",Answer: Staphylococcus aureus,Y,"Rationale: The described presentation is suggestive of infective endocarditis, a condition characterized by infection of the heart valves, in this case, the tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve is less commonly involved than the left-sided valves unless there is a history of IV drug use, in which case the causative organism is commonly Staphylococcus aureus. However, given no such history is provided here, the most likely causative organism would be Streptococcus species or Staphylococcus epidermidis, commonly associated with native valve endocarditis. It should be noted that a definitive diagnosis would require culture data.",Answer: Streptococcus species,N,"Rationale: The patient's condition as described in the question shows signs of infective endocarditis affecting the right side of the heart, specifically the tricuspid valve. This condition is often associated with intravenous drug use and is usually caused by staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium, which is a common cause of right-sided endocarditis. This bacterium is known to form large vegetations on the heart valves, leading to valve damage and potentially causing regurgitation.",Answer: Staphylococcus aureus,Y,"Rationale: The patient's presentation suggests infective endocarditis. The prior probability of Staphylococcus aureus being the causal organism is approximately 30%. Given the clinical scenario, a tricuspid valve infection could suggest IV drug use, which increases the likelihood of Staphylococcus aureus to 70%. Moreover, the finding of large vegetations further suggests a highly virulent organism such as Staphylococcus aureus, pushing the probability upwards to around 90%. Hence, the most likely causal organism in this case is Staphylococcus aureus.",Answer: Staphylococcus aureus,Y
"A 71-year-old man presents to the primary care clinic with non-specific complaints of fatigue and malaise. His past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, non-seminomatous testicular cancer, and hypercholesterolemia. He currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and he currently denies any illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7°C (98.0°F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min. On examination, his physician notices cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, as well as splenomegaly. The patient comments that he has lost 18.1 kg (40 lb) over the past 6 months without a change in diet or exercise, which he was initially not concerned about. The physician orders a complete blood count and adds on flow cytometry. Based on his age and overall epidemiology, what is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,N,Lymphoma,N,Lymphoma,N,Lymphoma,N,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,N,,"Rationale: The patient presents with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue and malaise. He has significant weight loss over the past 6 months, which is often associated with malignancies. His physical examination shows cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, indicating a systemic disease that affects the lymphatic system. Given his age and clinical findings, a hematological malignancy is highly suspected. The test of choice for diagnosing hematologic malignancies is flow cytometry, which the physician ordered, further suggesting this direction. Among hematological malignancies, the most common in adults, particularly in the elderly, is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).",Answer: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient could include lymphoma, HIV/AIDS, metastatic cancer, leukemia, tuberculosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. This patient has non-specific symptoms like fatigue and malaise, along with cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, as well as splenomegaly. These symptoms and signs can be seen in both lymphoma and leukemia. The weight loss, though not specific, is a ""B"" symptom that can often be seen in lymphomas.

His age and overall epidemiology are also important considerations. The patient's past history of non-seminomatous testicular cancer could potentially suggest metastasis, however, metastasis is typically associated with focal rather than generalized lymphadenopathy.

Given his age, the likelihood of a disease like HIV/AIDS is less probable, even though it can cause similar symptoms. Tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus usually present with more specific symptoms and are less likely in this case.

Leukemia often presents with generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and weight loss. The type of leukemia common in his age group would be chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The complete blood count and flow cytometry tests that the doctor ordered would also be expected in the case of suspected leukemia, especially CLL.

In conclusion, based on his age, clinical symptoms, and the ordered tests, the most likely diagnosis would be chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",Answer: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms include fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and the physical examination reveals cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. All these findings are suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Age is also a significant factor, as lymphomas are more common in older adults. Given his history of non-seminomatous testicular cancer, it's also worth noting that a history of cancer can increase the risk of a secondary malignancy. The decision to conduct a complete blood count and flow cytometry is also indicative, as these tests can be used to diagnose and characterize lymphomas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is some form of lymphoma, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma being more common in the elderly.",Answer: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,N,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with symptoms of fatigue, malaise, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, which are all indicative of lymphoproliferative disorders. The presence of splenomegaly and significant weight loss makes a malignancy more likely. Given his age and the description of both cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy bilaterally, this raises suspicion for a disseminated disease such as lymphoma. The testicular cancer does increase the patient's risk for other malignancies, although there is no well-established link to lymphoma specifically. Considering the patient's age, the most common type of lymphoma in the elderly is non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Also, flow cytometry is a test that would be ordered to help confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma as it can identify the presence of abnormal populations of lymphocytes.",Answer: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is 30% for a man of this age with unexplained weight loss and fatigue. The presence of unexplained cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy in this patient increases the probability of CLL to 45%. Additional signs of splenomegaly further raises this likelihood to 60%. Given the patient's weight loss of 18.1 kg without a change in diet or exercise, the probability rises to 75%. The fact that his physician is performing flow cytometry, a test typically used to identify the clonal B-cell population characteristic of CLL, pushes the posterior probability up to 85%. Thus, CLL is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y
"A 5-year-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a well-child visit. His mother reports him to be doing well and has no concerns. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, he is noted to have a right upper extremity blood pressure of 150/80 mm Hg. 2+ radial pulses and trace femoral pulses are felt. Cardiac auscultation reveals a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2. A 2/6 long systolic murmur with systolic ejection click is heard over left sternal border and back. The point of maximal impact is normal What is the most likely diagnosis?",Coarctation of the aorta,Coarctation of the aorta,Y,Coarctation of the aorta,Y,Coarctation of the aorta.,Y,Aortic stenosis,N,Coarctation of the Aorta.,Y,,"Rationale: The child presents with high blood pressure in the upper extremity and weak femoral pulses, alongside a long systolic murmur and systolic ejection click. These findings suggest a vascular problem, specifically between the upper and lower body. The most likely diagnosis is Coarctation of the Aorta, a congenital condition that causes narrowing of the aorta, leading to high blood pressure proximal to the site of coarctation (in this case the upper body) and lower blood pressure distal to it (lower body).",Answer: Coarctation of the Aorta,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this child includes coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, aortic stenosis, or possibly a peripheral artery disease. However, given his age and the specific findings in his case such as hypertension in the upper body, diminished pulses in the lower body, and a systolic murmur with ejection click heard over the left sternal border and back, this most likely points towards coarctation of the aorta. In coarctation of the aorta, there is a narrowing of the aorta that can cause increased pressure proximal to the defect (resulting in hypertension in the upper extremities) and decreased pressure distal to the defect (resulting in weak or delayed femoral pulses). The murmur heard is due to turbulent blood flow across the narrowed segment of the aorta.",Answer: Coarctation of the aorta.,Y,"Rationale: This 5-year-old boy presents with a significant discrepancy in upper and lower extremity blood pressures and decreased femoral pulses. These findings suggest a proximal aortic obstruction, with the most likely diagnosis being coarctation of the aorta. The systolic murmur and ejection click further support this diagnosis, as these are often heard in cases of coarctation due to turbulent blood flow at the site of the aortic narrowing.",Answer: Coarctation of the aorta,Y,"Rationale: This child has hypertension, as evidenced by the high blood pressure reading in the upper extremity, and decreased femoral pulses. These findings suggest a vascular abnormality leading to a pressure gradient between the upper and lower body. The systolic ejection click and murmur along the left sternal border are indicative of a structural cardiac abnormality. The most likely diagnosis in this case is coarctation of the aorta, a congenital condition in which the aorta is narrowed, leading to hypertension in the upper body (due to increased resistance) and hypotension in the lower body.",Answer: Coarctation of the aorta,Y,"Rationale:  The initial or prior probability of a pediatric patient having a cardiovascular abnormality, such as coarctation of the aorta, is relatively low. However, in this case, the presence of hypertension in the right arm (a blood pressure of 150/80 mm Hg is significantly elevated for a 5-year-old) raises the likelihood or the posterior probability. Normally, hypertension is not common in children, and when it does occur, it can often be a sign of an underlying condition.

Furthermore, the presence of diminished femoral pulses compared to radial pulses suggests a significant difference in blood pressure between the upper and lower body. This difference in pulse strength and blood pressure is characteristic of coarctation of the aorta, which further increases the posterior probability of this condition.

The murmur heard in this patient is suggestive of turbulent blood flow, which is consistent with a structural abnormality in the cardiovascular system. The location of the murmur over the left sternal border and back also supports the diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta. Each of these clues from the physical examination further increases the probability of coarctation of the aorta.

In conclusion, this boy's elevated blood pressure, diminished femoral pulses, and characteristic heart murmur, when combined with the principles of Bayesian inference, point to the most likely diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta.",Answer: Coarctation of the aorta.,Y

"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department for sudden weakness. The patient states that he was at home enjoying his morning coffee when his symptoms began. He says that his left arm suddenly felt very odd and weak thus prompting him to come to the ED. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, COPD, hypertension, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and PTSD. He recently fell off a horse while horseback riding but claims to not have experienced any significant injuries. He typically drinks 5-7 drinks per day and his last drink was yesterday afternoon. His current medications include insulin, metformin, atorvastatin, lisinopril, albuterol, and fluoxetine. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 93% on room air. On physical exam, you note an elderly man who is mildly confused. Cardiopulmonary exam demonstrates bilateral expiratory wheezes and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border that radiates to the carotids. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with finger-nose exam mildly abnormal on the left and heel-shin exam within normal limits. The patient has 5/5 strength in his right arm and 3/5 strength in his left arm. The patient struggles to manipulate objects such as a pen with his left hand. The patient is given a dose of diazepam and started on IV fluids. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Lipohyalinosis,Wernicke's Encephalopathy,N,Stroke,Y,Stroke,Y,Stroke,Y,Stroke,Y,,"Rationale: The patient has sudden weakness in the left arm and mild confusion, which are concerning symptoms for neurological events. Considering the patient's history of diabetes, hypertension, and alcohol abuse, he is at high risk for cerebrovascular accidents or strokes. His blood pressure is significantly elevated, which further adds to this risk. His neurological exam also indicates a potential upper motor neuron lesion, with a decreased strength in one arm. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is a stroke, specifically, an ischemic stroke affecting the right side of his brain (as motor symptoms usually present contralaterally).",Answer: Ischemic stroke,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes conditions such as cerebrovascular accident (CVA or stroke), transient ischemic attack (TIA), alcohol withdrawal, peripheral neuropathy related to diabetes, or an electrolyte imbalance.

The fact that the patient's symptoms are acute, lateralized to one side of the body, and involve a sudden change in strength makes conditions that typically present more gradually (like diabetic neuropathy or electrolyte imbalance) less likely. The patient's presentation is not characteristic of alcohol withdrawal, which typically manifests with symptoms like tremors, anxiety, and hallucinations several hours after cessation or reduction of prolonged, heavy alcohol use.

The patient has several risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, including hypertension (as evidenced by his current blood pressure and medication), diabetes (given the patient is on insulin and metformin), alcohol abuse, and potentially atherosclerosis (suggested by the presence of a systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids). The sudden onset of weakness specifically in the left arm along with difficulty manipulating objects is suggestive of a cerebrovascular event affecting the right side of the brain, which controls the left side of the body.

His neurological exam shows that cranial nerves II-XII are intact but the finger-nose exam is mildly abnormal on the left. This finding indicates a possible issue with proprioception or coordination, which can be seen in cerebrovascular events. The mild confusion could also be a manifestation of a cerebrovascular event, as cognitive changes can occur depending on the area of the brain affected.

In the given clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is a cerebrovascular accident, or stroke.",Answer: Stroke,Y,"Rationale: This patient's sudden onset of unilateral arm weakness and clumsiness, along with mildly confused state, and a history of hypertension, diabetes, and alcohol abuse are concerning for an acute ischemic cerebrovascular event, commonly referred to as a stroke. The increased blood pressure and tachycardia may be secondary to the acute event or chronic due to his history of hypertension. Although alcohol withdrawal may also cause confusion and autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, hypertension), the focal neurologic deficits (weakness in the left arm and clumsiness in handling objects) point more towards a cerebrovascular event. A stroke can be caused by a clot obstructing blood flow to a portion of the brain, leading to symptoms that reflect the areas of the brain that are affected.",Answer: Stroke,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of sudden onset left arm weakness and mild confusion is concerning for an acute cerebrovascular event, such as a stroke. His history of multiple risk factors such as hypertension (evidenced by his high blood pressure), diabetes, and alcohol abuse further increase his likelihood of having a stroke. A stroke may occur when blood supply to a part of the brain is disrupted, often due to a blood clot, leading to ischemia and death of brain tissue. This can manifest in a variety of ways, depending on which part of the brain is affected. In this case, the weakness in his left arm and his mild confusion suggest that the area of the brain affected is responsible for motor control of the right arm and higher cognitive functions. This would suggest a right hemispheric stroke, as the brain's functions are largely contralateral (the left side of the body is controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain and vice versa). Importantly, this would be considered a medical emergency requiring immediate investigation and intervention.",Answer: Stroke,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of a stroke is about 2% in the general population, but considering the patient's risk factors, such as age, hypertension, and diabetes, it's likely higher in this case. Sudden onset of one-sided weakness is a classic symptom of a stroke, raising the posterior probability of a stroke to perhaps 50%. The patient's mild confusion could also be a symptom of a stroke, raising the probability further to 60%. Furthermore, alcohol abuse, which the patient is known for, increases the likelihood of stroke, pushing the probability up to about 75%. In addition, the patient's blood pressure is significantly high at the time of presentation, which could be an additional indicator of a stroke, raising the probability to around 85%. The patient's abnormalities on the finger-nose test on the left side, along with decreased strength in the left arm, are also typical signs of a stroke, pushing the probability up to about 95%. Despite other conditions that could present with similar symptoms, a stroke is the most likely diagnosis in this patient considering the sudden onset of symptoms and the presence of several risk factors.",Answer: Stroke,Y
"A 25-year-old male patient presents to your clinic in significant distress. He states he has excruciating, stabbing pain around the left side of his head, and his left eye will not stop tearing. These types of headaches have been occurring for the past week every morning when he awakens and last around 60 minutes. He denies any aura, nausea, or vomiting. He denies any other past medical history. What is this patient's diagnosis?",Cluster headache,Cluster headaches,Y,Cluster headache.,Y,Cluster headache.,Y,Cluster headache,Y,Cluster headaches,Y,,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of unilateral (one-sided) stabbing pain around the eye, accompanied by tearing and no nausea or vomiting, occurring typically in the early morning, are indicative of a specific type of headache. The severe pain and duration of around 60 minutes align well with a cluster headache. Cluster headaches are notorious for their intense pain, often described as ""stabbing"" or like a ""hot poker in the eye."" They are more common in men and are typically strictly unilateral. Additionally, they are known to occur in 'clusters', frequently waking individuals from sleep, and can last from 15 to 180 minutes.",Answer: Cluster headache,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes migraines, tension headaches, cluster headaches, and potentially some forms of neuralgias or sinusitis. The distinguishing features of his symptoms, however, are the unilateral, severe, stabbing nature of the pain around the eye, the presence of autonomic symptoms (tearing of the eye), and the timing and frequency of the headaches (typically occur at the same time each day, often waking the patient from sleep). These characteristics are consistent with a cluster headache.",Answer: Cluster headache,Y,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with severe unilateral headaches, occurring mostly in the morning, and associated with autonomic symptoms such as tearing in the left eye. The stabbing nature and timing of the pain are also very characteristic. These features are suggestive of a primary headache disorder, specifically Cluster Headache. Cluster headaches often occur in ""clusters"" or periods of frequent attacks, usually around the same time each day, and are typically of short duration but intense severity.",Answer: Cluster Headache,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with severe, stabbing, unilateral headaches that last about an hour and are associated with ipsilateral autonomic symptoms (tearing in the left eye), indicating a trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC). These are a group of primary headache disorders characterized by severe, unilateral headache pain with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. The most common form of TAC, which fits this patient's pattern of short-lasting attacks, is cluster headache. The absence of aura, nausea, or vomiting further supports this diagnosis, as these symptoms are more characteristic of migraines. Therefore, this patient likely has cluster headaches.",Answer: Cluster headaches,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of cluster headache is approximately 0.1%. The patient has symptoms consistent with cluster headache, including unilateral severe headache, autonomic features such as tearing from the same side eye, and the attacks of pain occurring typically in the early morning hours, which increases the posterior probability of cluster headache to 60%. The fact that his headaches have been occurring for the past week and last around 60 minutes further increases the probability to 85%. In the absence of any aura, nausea, or vomiting, the likelihood of migraine decreases, further supporting the diagnosis of cluster headache.",Answer: Cluster headache.,Y
"A 33-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of lower abdominal pain and severe burning with urination. Two years ago, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and was successfully treated with a combination of radiation and chemotherapy. She has systemic lupus erythematosus and finished a course of cyclophosphamide 3 weeks ago. She is sexually active with multiple male and female partners and uses a diaphragm for contraception. She has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 12 years. Current medication includes hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), pulse is 84/min, and blood pressure is 136/84 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation over the pelvic region. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count 7,400/mm3
Platelet count 210,000/mm3

Nitrites positive
What is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?""",Ascending infection,Urinary tract infection,Y,Urinary tract infection,Y,Urinary tract infection,Y,Urinary tract infection,Y,UTI,Y,,"Rationale: The patient's presentation of lower abdominal pain and severe burning with urination, along with the laboratory findings of a positive nitrites test and white blood cells in the urine, is indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The underlying mechanism is usually bacterial infiltration of the urinary tract. The primary pathogens involved in UTIs are bacteria from the bowel, particularly E. coli, which can ascend from the urethra into the bladder (causing cystitis) and sometimes up to the kidneys (causing pyelonephritis). The diaphragm use and her multiple sexual partners increase her risk of UTI due to the potential introduction and spread of bacteria.",Answer: Bacterial infiltration of urinary tract,Y,"Rationale:
The differential for this patient includes urinary tract infection (UTI), interstitial cystitis, sexually transmitted infection, bladder cancer, and lupus cystitis. Given the patient's history of multiple sexual partners, a sexually transmitted infection is possible, however, there's no mention of abnormal discharge which often accompanies such conditions. Interstitial cystitis could present with these symptoms, but it's typically a diagnosis of exclusion when other causes have been ruled out. Lupus cystitis can also cause these symptoms but it's less likely in this case since it is a less common manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus and is usually accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms. Bladder cancer could also present with these symptoms, especially considering her smoking history and previous radiation treatment for cervical cancer, but it usually presents with hematuria, and there is no significant amount of blood in her urine.

The presence of leukocytes (WBC 62/hpf), nitrites, and symptoms such as lower abdominal pain and dysuria strongly suggest a urinary tract infection. Nitrites in the urine are indicative of the presence of bacteria that can convert nitrates to nitrites, such as E. coli, which is the most common cause of urinary tract infections. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition is bacterial infection of the urinary tract.",Answer: Bacterial urinary infection,Y,"Rationale: The patient's presentation of lower abdominal pain, severe burning with urination, and tenderness in the pelvic region suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urine lab findings reinforce this, particularly with the positive nitrites, which are a common sign of bacterial infection, and the presence of numerous white blood cells in the urine (WBC 62/hpf), indicative of an inflammatory response. The patient's history of multiple sexual partners and use of a diaphragm for contraception may have increased her risk for UTIs. Diaphragms can promote bacterial growth and make it more difficult for the body to naturally clear bacteria from the urinary tract. Also, the patient's recent use of cyclophosphamide (an immunosuppressive drug) for systemic lupus erythematosus may have made her more susceptible to infection. The mechanism behind this patient's condition is likely bacterial invasion of the urinary tract, made more likely by her use of a diaphragm and recent immunosuppression.",Answer: Bacterial invasion of urinary tract,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms including lower abdominal pain, severe burning with urination, and positive nitrites in the urine suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The mechanism of UTI often involves bacteria (commonly E. coli) ascending the urethra to the bladder, leading to cystitis. This can cause dysuria, urgency, frequency and lower abdominal pain. The presence of white blood cells (WBC) in the urine is a response to the infection. Nitrites in the urine are also indicative of a bacterial infection, as many bacteria (including E. coli) convert dietary nitrates to nitrites. This patient's sexual activity, female gender, and recent treatment with cyclophosphamide (which can lead to bladder irritation and increased susceptibility to infection) are likely contributing factors.",Answer: Bacterial ascension of the urethra,Y,"Rationale:

Step 1: We start with considering the prior probability. Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are a common condition, especially in sexually active women. The prior probability of a UTI is quite high, especially in a patient presenting with burning on urination and lower abdominal pain. This indicates the infection might have spread to the kidneys, leading to a possible diagnosis of pyelonephritis.

Step 2: Her recent course of cyclophosphamide can potentially suppress her immune system, increasing her susceptibility to infections such as a UTI, further increasing the posterior probability of a UTI.

Step 3: The presence of nitrites in the urine indicates the presence of bacteria that convert nitrates to nitrites, and this is a classic sign of a bacterial UTI, increasing the posterior probability further.

Step 4: The large number of white blood cells in her urine (WBC 62/hpf) also indicate a bacterial infection, as these cells are part of the body's response to bacterial invasion.

Step 5: Lastly, her tender pelvic region on physical examination corroborates the conclusion of a urinary tract infection.

Given the symptoms, history, and lab findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition is bacterial infection of the urinary tract, possibly due to immune suppression from recent chemotherapy.","Answer:

"A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of syncope. He reports sudden onset of palpitations followed by loss of consciousness while carrying his groceries to his car. He is unable to recall any further details and does not have any chest pain or dizziness. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastroparesis, and osteoarthritis of the knees. Medications include lisinopril, metformin, and ondansetron as needed for nausea. He also takes methadone daily for chronic pain. Apart from an abrasion on his forehead, he appears well. His temperature is 37.2 °C (98.9 F), heart rate is 104/min and regular, and blood pressure is 135/70 mm Hg. While he is in the emergency department, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis that spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Results of a complete blood count, serum electrolyte concentrations, and serum thyroid studies show no abnormalities. Cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",Prolonged QT interval,Torsades de pointes,N,Arrhythmia.,N,Ventricular tachycardia.,N,Arrhythmia,N,Torsades de pointes,N,,"Rationale: This patient experienced syncope, which is characterized by a sudden, transient loss of consciousness, often due to insufficient cerebral blood flow. This is often associated with cardiovascular conditions, among others. The patient's history of sudden onset palpitations followed by loss of consciousness indicates an arrhythmic event. The telemetry data supports this, showing a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with changing QRS complexes (i.e., Torsades de Pointes) can occur due to various factors, but in this case, the patient's medication, methadone, is likely the cause. Methadone is known to prolong the QT interval and can induce Torsades de Pointes, leading to syncope.",Answer: Methadone-induced arrhythmia,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient's syncope includes conditions like cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and side effects from medications. The telemetry data shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, a condition known as Torsades de Pointes. Factors contributing to this condition can include electrolyte imbalances (which have been ruled out), structural heart disease, and medications that prolong the QT interval. The patient is on methadone, a known QT-prolonging medication, which is likely the contributing factor to the development of Torsades de Pointes and thus, the syncope.",Answer: Methadone use,N,"Rationale: This patient's syncopal episodes are associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, specifically torsades de pointes, which is seen as cyclic alterations of the QRS complex on telemetry. One of the common causes of torsades de pointes is drug-induced QT interval prolongation. In this case, the patient is taking methadone, which is known to prolong the QT interval and can precipitate torsades de pointes, especially in high doses or in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation. Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope is the methadone use.",Answer: Methadone use.,N,"Rationale:

This patient's sudden onset of palpitations followed by loss of consciousness (syncope) can be explained by a transient loss of cerebral blood flow secondary to ventricular tachycardia (VT). Telemetry revealed polymorphic VT, which could be torsades de pointes, a particular form of VT where the QRS complex appears to twist around the EKG baseline, and this condition is often transient and self-resolving, like in this patient. Several factors can cause torsades de pointes, including electrolyte imbalances, congenital long QT syndromes, and medications. In this patient, the most likely cause is his methadone use. Methadone is known to prolong the QT interval and can precipitate torsades de pointes, particularly at high doses or in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation.",Answer: Methadone use,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of Torsades de Pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, causing the syncope is moderate in a patient with a history of heart issues. However, the presentation of cyclic alteration of the QRS axis on telemetry increases the posterior probability substantially. The medication methadone, which this patient is taking, is known to prolong the QT interval, which can trigger Torsades de Pointes. This further increases the likelihood to a significant level. His other conditions and medications do not contribute as significantly to the posterior probability. This patient's syncope is therefore most likely due to Torsades de Pointes induced by the methadone he is taking.",Answer: Methadone-induced Torsades de Pointes.,Y
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with nausea and vomiting. The patient started experiencing these symptoms shortly after arriving home from going out to eat at a seafood restaurant. His symptoms progressed and now he reports having an odd metallic taste in his mouth, diffuse pruritus, and blurry vision. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 120/72 mmHg, pulse is 50/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals bradycardia and an inability of the patient to differentiate hot versus cold; no rash can be appreciated on exam. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms?",Ciguatoxin,Ciguatera poisoning,Y,Ciguatera poisoning,Y,Scombroid poisoning,N,Food poisoning,N,Scombroid poisoning,N,,"Rationale: The patient presented symptoms shortly after having a meal at a seafood restaurant, and these symptoms include nausea, vomiting, an odd metallic taste, pruritus (itchiness), blurry vision, bradycardia (slow heart rate), and difficulty differentiating hot versus cold. These are consistent with the symptoms of scombroid poisoning or histamine fish poisoning, which can occur after consumption of improperly stored or spoiled fish, especially certain types of fish like mackerel and tuna. The symptoms occur due to high levels of histamine and possibly other substances. Immediate onset of symptoms after eating fish and the presence of classic signs such as flushing, rash, and hypotension further support the diagnosis.",Answer: Scombroid poisoning,N,"Rationale:

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation could include: food poisoning, an allergic reaction, botulism, scombroid poisoning, or ciguatera poisoning.

Food poisoning is a possibility, but it usually presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain, which are not reported here. An allergic reaction could cause nausea, vomiting, and pruritus, but it wouldn't typically cause an odd metallic taste or altered temperature sensation. Botulism could cause blurred vision and bradycardia, but it is typically associated with home-canned foods, not seafood.

The symptoms of metallic taste, pruritus, and blurred vision, along with the cardiovascular and sensory changes, are more indicative of fish poisonings: scombroid and ciguatera. Scombroid poisoning, however, is often associated with the ingestion of dark meat fish like tuna or mackerel and would typically cause flushing and possibly a rash, which is not reported here.

Ciguatera poisoning, on the other hand, can cause nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and bradycardia, and a characteristic feature is the reversal of hot and cold sensation, which this patient presents with. This makes ciguatera poisoning the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Answer: Ciguatera poisoning,Y,"Rationale: This patient has recently consumed seafood and is now presenting with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, pruritus, blurry vision, and neurological changes including bradycardia and abnormal temperature sensation. These symptoms are consistent with ciguatera poisoning, which is a foodborne illness caused by consuming certain reef fish that have accumulated ciguatoxins produced by dinoflagellates. The toxin causes a variety of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and neurological symptoms, which can include the ones this patient is experiencing.",Answer: Ciguatera poisoning.,Y,"Rationale: The symptoms of nausea, vomiting, metallic taste, pruritus (itching), blurry vision, bradycardia, and temperature sensation abnormalities this patient experiences after eating at a seafood restaurant strongly suggest scombroid poisoning. Scombroid poisoning, also known as histamine fish poisoning, is an illness that occurs after consuming improperly stored fish, such as mackerel or tuna, which have high histamine content due to bacterial overgrowth and subsequent decarboxylation of histidine. The clinical presentation often includes symptoms that are similar to an allergic reaction, including flushing, pruritus, and gastrointestinal upset. The temperature sensation abnormalities and bradycardia are likely secondary to the histamine-mediated vasodilation and may not be seen in all cases of scombroid poisoning.",Answer: Scombroid poisoning,N,"Rationale:

The prior probability of seafood poisoning is relatively high due to the fact that the symptoms occurred shortly after the patient consumed seafood. We will start with a posterior probability of 50%. When seafood poisoning occurs, one common type is Ciguatera poisoning, which is associated with consuming contaminated reef fish and causes gastrointestinal symptoms, unusual sensations, and bradycardia. This raises the posterior probability to 65%. The presence of a metallic taste, pruritus, and visual disturbances, are also commonly seen in Ciguatera poisoning, which raises the probability further to 80%. Another characteristic symptom of Ciguatera poisoning is temperature reversal (where hot feels cold and cold feels hot), which he seems to have (an inability to differentiate hot versus cold), taking the posterior probability up to 95%. The absence of a rash does not exclude Ciguatera poisoning, thus the high probability remains. Given these symptoms and his recent seafood consumption, the most likely etiology of the patient's symptoms is Ciguatera poisoning.","Answer:

"A 43-year-old man comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath for 1 month. He has been using two pillows at night but frequently wakes up feeling as if he is choking. Five months ago, he underwent surgery for creation of an arteriovenous fistula in his left upper arm. He has hypertension and chronic kidney disease due to reflux nephropathy. He receives hemodialysis three times a week. His current medications are enalapril, vitamin D3, erythropoietin, sevelamer, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), respirations are 22/min, pulse is 103/min and bounding, and blood pressure is 106/58 mm Hg. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. There is jugular venous distention. A prominent thrill is heard over the brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula. There are crackles heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The abdomen is soft and nontender. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",High output heart failure,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,,"Rationale: The patient is experiencing symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath, waking up feeling as if he is choking, bilateral pitting pedal edema, and an S3 gallop. These are all signs of fluid overload in the body. The patient has a history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease and is currently on hemodialysis. An important aspect of his history is the recent creation of an arteriovenous fistula in his left upper arm for hemodialysis. An arteriovenous fistula can result in a significant increase in blood flow from the arterial system to the venous system. Over time, this can lead to high-output heart failure as the heart works harder to pump the increased volume of blood. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is high-output heart failure due to the arteriovenous fistula created for hemodialysis.",Answer: High-output heart failure,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient's presentation includes heart failure, fluid overload from kidney disease, a complication related to the arteriovenous fistula (AVF), or pulmonary disease. The symptoms such as orthopnea (using two pillows at night), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up feeling as if choking), jugular venous distention, pitting pedal edema, and an S3 gallop on cardiac examination are classic signs of heart failure. Further, an AVF can contribute to high-output heart failure, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. High-output heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to keep up with an increased demand for blood flow. An AVF, as in this patient, can increase this demand because it creates a pathway for blood to bypass the capillaries and flow directly from an artery to a vein, increasing overall blood flow and the heart's workload. Given the symptoms and his recent AVF surgery, it is most likely that this patient's heart failure symptoms are due to the increased workload on the heart created by the arteriovenous fistula.",Answer: Arteriovenous fistula-induced heart failure.,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms of congestive heart failure, including shortness of breath, orthopnea (needing two pillows to breathe at night), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up feeling like he is choking), and bilateral pedal edema. An S3 gallop is indicative of volume overload, while jugular venous distention also points towards right-sided heart failure. He has an arteriovenous (AV) fistula for his hemodialysis, which can contribute to high-output heart failure due to the increased preload and the decreased systemic vascular resistance associated with AV fistulas. The AV fistula can lead to an increased workload for the heart, and in patients with underlying heart or kidney disease, it can exacerbate heart failure. Hence, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is high-output heart failure secondary to his arteriovenous fistula.",Answer: High-output heart failure,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms indicative of congestive heart failure such as shortness of breath, orthopnea, and bilateral pitting pedal edema. The AV fistula created for his hemodialysis sessions can contribute to high-output heart failure by increasing cardiac preload. The AV fistula provides a low resistance path which increases blood return to the heart, thus increasing the cardiac output. In response to this increased demand, the heart initially compensates by dilating and increasing contractility (bounding pulse, as in this case). But in long term or in individuals with existing cardiac problems, this adaptive response may not suffice, leading to heart failure. The S3 gallop and crackles heard at both lung bases are other indications of heart failure.",Answer: High-output heart failure,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of high-output heart failure in a patient with an arteriovenous fistula is around 10%. The patient presents with features suggestive of heart failure like shortness of breath, orthopnea, bilateral pitting pedal edema, and jugular venous distention, increasing the posterior probability to around 30%. The presence of an S3 gallop, a sign of heart failure, increases the probability further to 50%. Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease requiring hemodialysis and the recent creation of an arteriovenous fistula, the probability of high-output heart failure increases even more, to about 80%. Therefore, this patient's symptoms are most likely due to high-output heart failure related to his arteriovenous fistula.",Answer: High-output heart failure,Y
"A 17-year-old boy comes to the physician because of body aches and sore throat for 1 week. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. He lives with his parents; they recently adopted a cat from an animal shelter. He is sexually active with one female partner, and they use condoms consistently. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg. Examination shows bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. The pharynx is red and swollen. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 15 g/dL
Leukocyte count 11,500/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 48%
Band forms 2%
Basophils 0.5%
Eosinophils 1%

When the patient's serum is added to a sample of horse erythrocytes, the cells aggregate together. What is the most likely causal pathogen?""",Epstein Barr virus,Bartonella henselae,N,Streptococcus pyogenes,N,Bartonella henselae,N,Mononucleosis,Y,Bartonella henselae,N,,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, body aches, and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy are suggestive of an infectious cause, most likely a viral one. A distinguishing factor in this patient's presentation is the reaction of his serum to horse erythrocytes, which indicates a positive heterophile antibody test. This is most commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis (also known as ""mono"" or ""the kissing disease""). Although this disease can be transmitted in various ways, it's often spread through saliva, which is why it's colloquially known as the ""kissing disease"". The recent acquisition of a cat does not contribute to this diagnosis, as the main zoonotic disease associated with cats, cat scratch disease (Bartonella henselae), does not typically present with these symptoms or laboratory findings.",Answer: Epstein-Barr virus,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for a patient with fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy includes group A Streptococcus (Strep throat), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; Infectious mononucleosis), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). It's also possible to consider Cat-Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae), given the recent adoption of a cat. However, the presence of a positive heterophile antibody test (indicated by the aggregation of horse erythrocytes) is a classic finding in infectious mononucleosis, which is most commonly caused by EBV. This, in conjunction with his symptoms and lymphocytosis in the blood work, makes EBV the most likely causative agent. It's worth noting that Cat-Scratch Disease typically presents with regional lymphadenopathy, not posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and a negative heterophile antibody test.",Answer: Epstein-Barr virus,Y,"Rationale:  The symptoms and clinical findings such as fever, body aches, sore throat, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, and a positive result for the heterophile antibody test (horse erythrocyte aggregation) all strongly suggest infectious mononucleosis. Infectious mononucleosis is typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a member of the Herpesviridae family.",Answer: Epstein-Barr virus,Y,"Rationale: The clinical picture presented here is consistent with infectious mononucleosis, which is most commonly caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Features suggestive of infectious mononucleosis include the patient's age, symptoms (such as sore throat and body aches), and the observed posterior cervical lymphadenopathy. The horse erythrocyte agglutination, also known as the Monospot test, is used to detect heterophile antibodies, which are typically elevated in infectious mononucleosis, further supporting the diagnosis. While it's worth noting that the patient recently adopted a cat (raising the possibility of diseases such as cat scratch disease), the overall clinical picture fits more with infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV.",Answer: Epstein-Barr virus,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causing the symptoms presented by the patient is relatively high (let's say, 20%) given that EBV is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, which often presents with symptoms such as sore throat, body aches, and fever.

Considering the symptoms more closely, the patient's sore throat, which is a common symptom of infectious mononucleosis, increases the probability of EBV infection to 30%. The patient's swollen and red pharynx also suggests a viral infection, likely increasing the probability of EBV to 40%. The bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy is also a typical presentation in cases of infectious mononucleosis, further increasing the probability of EBV infection to 60%.

The adopted cat from an animal shelter might raise some suspicion for Bartonella henselae, the causative agent of cat scratch disease. However, given the symptomatology and the lack of a reported scratch or bite, this is less likely.

The crucial piece of information is the result from the laboratory experiment where the patient's serum caused horse erythrocytes to aggregate together. This is a test for heterophile antibodies, which are commonly produced during an EBV infection, thereby substantially increasing the probability of EBV infection to nearly 90%.",Answer: Epstein-Barr virus,Y

Additionally, she has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. She also exhibits left costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination. These symptoms combined with the presence of positive nitrites and leukocyte esterase in the urine, as well as significant white blood cell presence and many bacteria, strongly suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI) that has ascended to the kidneys, causing pyelonephritis.",Answer: Pyelonephritis,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes urinary tract infection (UTI), pyelonephritis, interstitial cystitis, or bladder stones. The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, and urinary urgency and frequency, along with the physical examination finding of costovertebral angle tenderness, are suggestive of a urinary tract infection that has ascended to the kidneys, which is consistent with pyelonephritis. Furthermore, her laboratory findings, including turbid urine, positive nitrites, and leukocyte esterase in the urine as well as presence of bacteria, are indicative of a bacterial infection in the urinary tract. Also, her history of recurrent UTIs makes her more susceptible to pyelonephritis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is pyelonephritis.",Answer: Pyelonephritis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of fever, chills, nausea, urinary urgency, frequency, and left costovertebral angle tenderness along with a history of recurrent UTIs indicate a kidney infection or pyelonephritis. Furthermore, the urinalysis showing nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and many bacteria are indicative of a bacterial urinary tract infection that has likely ascended to the kidneys. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute pyelonephritis.",Answer: Acute pyelonephritis.,Y,"Rationale: This patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, and the symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, urinary urgency, and frequency suggest that she is currently experiencing another urinary tract infection. However, the presence of costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination points towards the infection having spread from the bladder (which would cause cystitis) to the kidneys, leading to a condition called pyelonephritis. Additionally, the urinalysis findings of a high white blood cell count and the presence of bacteria, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase are all consistent with a urinary tract infection, supporting the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.",Answer: Pyelonephritis,Y,"The prior probability of pyelonephritis in a young woman presenting with fever, chills, nausea, urinary urgency, and frequency is about 25% given her symptoms and age. The presence of costovertebral angle tenderness, a classic sign of kidney involvement, increases the posterior probability to around 60%. Moreover, she has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections which further increases the probability to 80%. The urinalysis findings further support the diagnosis of pyelonephritis: positive nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and many bacteria seen under microscopy align with a urinary tract infection that has likely ascended to the kidneys. This increases the final posterior probability to near certainty, at approximately 95%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is pyelonephritis.",Answer: Pyelonephritis.,Y
"A 54-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of progressive difficulty walking during the past 3 months. He has not been able to walk without assistance for the past month and has started to use a wheelchair. He also reports having urinary incontinence for 1 year. His wife says that he has begun to slur his words and has become very difficult to understand. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 16/min. His blood pressure is 130/80mm Hg while sitting and 110/65mm Hg when standing. He is oriented to person and place but not to time. Neurological examination shows a mild tremor in his right hand and rigidity in his upper and lower extremities. He is unable to perform repetitive rotary forearm movements. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Multiple system atrophy,Parkinson's Disease,N,Parkinson's disease,N,Parkinson's disease,N,Parkinson's disease,N,Parkinson's Disease,N,,"Rationale: This patient presents with multiple neurological symptoms including difficulty walking, slurred speech, urinary incontinence, a mild tremor in his right hand, and rigidity in his limbs. Additionally, his difficulty with performing repetitive rotary forearm movements suggests the presence of bradykinesia, or slowed movement. His symptoms, especially the combination of bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, are strongly indicative of a parkinsonian syndrome. However, the early and severe imbalance with falls, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment he displays are not typical of Parkinson's disease. Instead, they are more consistent with a condition known as multiple system atrophy (MSA), specifically a subtype known as MSA-P (parkinsonian subtype), which can present with symptoms similar to Parkinson's but with additional features including autonomic dysfunction and cerebellar signs.",Answer: Multiple System Atrophy,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient can include Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, or a stroke. The symptoms of slurred speech, difficulty walking, urinary incontinence, hand tremor, and rigidity in upper and lower extremities are suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder.

Parkinson's disease is usually characterized by rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. However, the progression of this disease is usually slow and it does not commonly cause urinary incontinence in the early stages.

Multiple system atrophy (MSA), on the other hand, often presents with parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor) along with autonomic dysfunction (like urinary incontinence) and cerebellar signs, making this a more likely diagnosis given the symptomatology. Additionally, the rapid progression over 3 months is more consistent with MSA than Parkinson's, which tends to progress more slowly.

Progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration are less likely, given the absence of distinctive features like vertical gaze palsy in the former, and asymmetric limb apraxia and dystonia in the latter.

While a stroke could explain some of these symptoms, the slow and progressive onset makes this less likely.",Answer: Multiple system atrophy.,Y,"Rationale: This patient has progressive difficulty walking, urinary incontinence, speech difficulties, and a neurologic examination showing a mild tremor and rigidity. These signs are strongly suggestive of a neurodegenerative disease. The combined presence of parkinsonism (evidenced by tremor and rigidity), dementia (indicated by disorientation), and impaired postural reflexes (evident in the blood pressure drop upon standing, indicating autonomic dysfunction) points to a diagnosis of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism, and ataxia.",Answer: Multiple System Atrophy,Y,"Rationale: This patient's difficulty walking, urinary incontinence, and decline in speech clarity are suggestive of a syndrome called normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The classic clinical triad of NPH is gait disturbances, dementia, and urinary incontinence, often in that order. His neurologic examination shows parkinsonism (rigidity, bradykinesia as shown by his inability to perform rapid alternating movements, and a mild tremor), which can also be associated with NPH. Furthermore, orthostatic hypotension can be seen in NPH due to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. Even though the syndrome is called ""normal pressure,"" the intracranial pressure can fluctuate and it's the ""normal"" pressure that often leads to a delay in diagnosis as a typical lumbar puncture may not reveal elevated pressure.",Answer: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus,N,"The prior probability of Parkinson's disease in this patient's age group is around 1%. The presence of rigidity and a tremor in the patient's extremities increases the likelihood of Parkinson's disease to about 30%. The difficulty with walking and the need for a wheelchair further increases the likelihood to about 60%. The presence of urinary incontinence and slurred speech, which can both be seen in advanced Parkinson's disease, increases the probability to 75%. His difficulty with performing repetitive rotary forearm movements, which suggests bradykinesia, another cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease, further increases the probability to about 85%. In addition, the patient's postural hypotension can be a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease, further supporting the diagnosis. Therefore, based on the Bayesian approach, this patient most likely has Parkinson's disease.",Answer: Parkinson's disease,N
"Six hours after delivery, a 3050-g (6-lb 12-oz) male newborn is noted to have feeding intolerance and several episodes of bilious vomiting. He was born at term to a healthy 35-year-old woman following a normal vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, but the patient's mother had missed several of her prenatal checkups. The patient's older brother underwent surgery for pyloric stenosis as an infant. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur is heard at the left mid to lower sternal border. Abdominal examination shows a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen. There is no organomegaly. An x-ray of the abdomen is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Duodenal atresia,Pyloric stenosis,N,Pyloric stenosis,N,Pyloric stenosis,N,Pyloric stenosis,N,Pyloric stenosis,N,,"Rationale: The clinical features of bilious vomiting and feeding intolerance in a newborn are typically suggestive of a gastrointestinal obstruction. In this case, given the physical findings, we can infer that the baby has Down Syndrome (epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease). Among neonates with Down Syndrome, duodenal atresia is a common congenital anomaly. Duodenal atresia often presents with bilious vomiting, feeding intolerance and a 'double bubble' sign on abdominal x-ray which is characteristic of this condition. The 'double bubble' sign indicates the presence of two air-filled spaces in the abdomen, representing the stomach and the proximal duodenum, with no gas found distally. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is duodenal atresia.",Answer: Duodenal atresia,Y,"The differential for this newborn includes: congenital malformation syndromes, genetic syndromes such as Down syndrome, and gastrointestinal tract abnormalities such as duodenal atresia, intestinal malrotation with midgut volvulus, pyloric stenosis, or Hirschsprung disease.

The physical examination reveals features such as epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease, which are common characteristics of Down syndrome. Furthermore, Down syndrome is associated with congenital heart defects, which is consistent with the grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard during the examination.

The gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically feeding intolerance, bilious vomiting, and the observation of a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen are concerning for a gastrointestinal obstruction.

In Down syndrome, duodenal atresia is a common congenital abnormality, and would account for these symptoms. The X-ray might show a 'double-bubble' sign, which is indicative of duodenal atresia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is duodenal atresia, particularly considering the features of Down syndrome and the gastrointestinal symptoms presented.",Answer: Duodenal atresia.,Y,"Rationale: This neonate presents with features of Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) including epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease. The description of the abdomen being distended in the upper half and concave in the lower half, along with bilious vomiting shortly after feeding, is strongly suggestive of duodenal atresia, a condition in which there is a blockage in the first part of the small intestines. Duodenal atresia is a congenital anomaly that is more common in children with Down syndrome. Moreover, a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur could hint towards a congenital heart defect, which is also more common in children with Down syndrome.",Answer: Duodenal atresia,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with progressive difficulty in walking, urinary incontinence, speech difficulty (slurring words), a resting tremor, and rigidity. These symptoms together suggest a neurodegenerative condition. The classic parkinsonian triad includes bradykinesia (as evidenced by his difficulty with repetitive movements), resting tremor, and rigidity. However, Parkinson's disease is usually associated with a normal mental state, which is not the case with this patient. The presence of both parkinsonian symptoms and cognitive impairment (as shown by disorientation to time) along with urinary incontinence points towards a condition known as ""Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus"" (NPH). NPH classically presents with the triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. Furthermore, the lack of orthostatic hypotension indicates that this is not a case of Multiple System Atrophy which could also present with similar symptoms but typically with autonomic dysfunction, including orthostatic hypotension.",Answer: Down Syndrome,N,"The prior probability of a child having Down syndrome is around 1 in 700, or about 0.14%. However, this child has several physical findings indicative of Down syndrome, including epicanthus, upward slanting of the eyelids, low-set ears, and a single transverse palmar crease. These clinical signs increase the posterior probability of Down syndrome to around 50%. Furthermore, the presence of a heart murmur indicative of a congenital heart defect, which is common in Down syndrome, raises the probability to 70%. The presence of a family history of pyloric stenosis further increases the probability of a Down syndrome diagnosis to around 75%. Given the symptoms of feeding intolerance and bilious vomiting, combined with the physical exam findings of a distended upper abdomen and a concave-shaped lower abdomen, the most likely diagnosis for the current condition causing these symptoms is duodenal atresia, which is associated with Down syndrome.

"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with abdominal pain. His father tells the attending physician that his son has been experiencing severe stomach aches over the past week. They are intermittent in nature, but whenever they occur he cries and draws up his knees to his chest. This usually provides some relief. The parents have also observed mucousy stools and occasional bloody stools that are bright red with blood clots. They tell the physician that their child has never experienced this type of abdominal pain up to the present. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, his vitals are generally normal with a slight fever and mild tachycardia. The boy appears uncomfortable. An abdominal exam reveals a sausage-shaped mass in the right upper abdomen. What is the most common cause of these symptoms?",Idiopathic,Intussusception,Y,Appendicitis,N,Intussusception,Y,Intussusception,Y,Appendicitis,N,,"Rationale: The child's symptoms of intermittent, severe abdominal pain, drawing up of knees, and bloody, mucousy stools are indicative of intussusception, which is a common cause of bowel obstruction in children aged 6 months to 3 years. The ""sausage-shaped mass"" palpated in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen during the physical examination is a classic sign of intussusception. In intussusception, a segment of the bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, causing impaired blood flow, inflammation, and potentially, necrosis of the bowel wall. The most common cause of intussusception is idiopathic, but it can sometimes be precipitated by a viral infection causing lymphoid hyperplasia, which serves as a lead point for the intussusception.",Answer: Idiopathic intussusception,Y,"The differential for this patient includes intussusception, appendicitis, gastroenteritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a bowel obstruction. Given the child's age, the presentation of intermittent severe abdominal pain that's relieved by drawing up his knees, as well as the passage of mucousy and sometimes bloody stools, intussusception is more likely. The finding of a ""sausage-shaped"" mass in the right upper abdomen on physical exam also supports this. Intussusception occurs when one portion of the bowel telescopes into an adjacent segment, and it is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between 6 months and 3 years. Therefore, the most common cause of this child's symptoms is intussusception.",Answer: Intussusception,N,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of fever, body aches, sore throat, and bilateral posterior cervical lymphadenopathy are suggestive of a systemic infection. In a young, sexually active person, this combination of symptoms commonly points to infectious mononucleosis, which is most often caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The lab findings are also consistent with infectious mononucleosis, as the disease can cause a relative lymphocytosis with a significant number of atypical lymphocytes (although not separately reported here). The test mentioned in the question, where the patient's serum causes horse erythrocytes to aggregate, is known as the Monospot test, which detects heterophile antibodies. These antibodies are produced during an infection with EBV and are a common way of confirming a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis.",Answer: Epstein-Barr virus.,N,"Rationale: This young patient's episodic abdominal pain associated with pulling his knees to his chest, combined with the 'currant jelly' stools (stools that are bloody and mucousy) and palpable 'sausage-shaped' mass in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen, are characteristic of intussusception. Intussusception is a condition that often presents in children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years, where a part of the intestine 'telescopes' into an adjacent part, causing bowel obstruction and compromised blood flow. The most common form of intussusception, ileocolic intussusception, is commonly idiopathic but may be triggered by a viral infection that causes hypertrophy of the Peyer's patches, lymphoid aggregates in the wall of the small intestine, which can act as a lead point.",Answer: Intussusception,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of intussusception in a 3-year-old boy with abdominal pain is about 10%. The symptom of drawing up knees to chest, which typically provides relief, increases the posterior probability of intussusception to around 40%. The presence of mucousy, occasionally bloody stools, a common symptom in intussusception, further raises the probability to 70%. Finally, the detection of a 'sausage-shaped' mass in the right upper abdomen, which is a characteristic finding in intussusception, raises the probability to about 90%. Hence, the most likely diagnosis in this case is intussusception.",Answer: Intussusception,N
"Three days after undergoing cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction, a 70-year-old man develops shortness of breath at rest. He has hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, sublingual nitroglycerin, metoprolol, and insulin. He appears diaphoretic. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/55 mm Hg. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a new grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex. An ECG shows sinus rhythm with T wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?",Papillary muscle rupture,Cardiac tamponade,N,Pericardial effusion,N,Pericarditis,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Pericardial effusion,N,,"Rationale: This patient has recently undergone a cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. Now, three days after, he develops shortness of breath at rest, appears diaphoretic, and has crackles at both lung bases on auscultation, all of which are signs of heart failure. Additionally, a new holosystolic murmur is heard at the cardiac apex, suggesting mitral valve insufficiency. T wave inversion on an EKG is usually indicative of myocardial ischemia or infarction. These clinical features can be explained by a complication related to his recent myocardial infarction, namely, the rupture of the papillary muscle or chordae tendineae, leading to severe mitral regurgitation, left-sided heart failure, and pulmonary congestion.",Answer: Mitral regurgitation.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes heart failure, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome, valvular heart disease, and pulmonary embolism. The presence of crackles at both lung bases could suggest heart failure or pneumonia. The new holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex in the setting of a recent myocardial infarction points toward a mechanical complication, such as mitral valve regurgitation due to papillary muscle rupture. This would also explain the patient's heart failure symptoms (shortness of breath, diaphoresis, tachycardia, hypotension). The T-wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF on ECG further indicates that there has been ischemic damage to the inferior wall of the heart. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is acute mitral regurgitation secondary to papillary muscle rupture.",Answer: Papillary muscle rupture.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is consistent with acute left-sided heart failure precipitated by a new systolic murmur at the cardiac apex, suggestive of mitral regurgitation. His recent cardiac catheterization and angioplasty for myocardial infarction could have resulted in papillary muscle rupture. Papillary muscle rupture is a rare but serious complication of myocardial infarction, typically occurring 2-7 days after the event. It leads to severe mitral regurgitation and manifests as acute heart failure with symptoms of dyspnea, hypotension, and pulmonary edema (as indicated by the crackles at both lung bases).",Answer: Papillary muscle rupture,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of rest dyspnea, diaphoresis, bilateral lung crackles, and new holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex are indicative of congestive heart failure, likely due to a complication of his recent myocardial infarction. The murmur suggests a mitral regurgitation, a condition where the mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow back into the heart. Mitral regurgitation can occur due to ischemic injury to the papillary muscles, leading to their dysfunction. Papillary muscle dysfunction is a recognized complication of myocardial infarction, which could be the case here, especially considering his recent angioplasty. The crackles heard on lung auscultation suggest fluid accumulation, a common sign of left-sided heart failure that can occur when severe mitral regurgitation is present.",Answer: Mitral Regurgitation,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of having a mitral regurgitation due to complication of myocardial infarction in a patient who has undergone a cardiac procedure is about 2%. This 70-year-old man has recently undergone cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction. Given the patient's recent myocardial infarction and intervention, the probability of a complication such as mitral regurgitation due to a damaged papillary muscle increases, perhaps to about 10%.

He now presents with symptoms of shortness of breath at rest and appears diaphoretic, signs of potential heart failure. These symptoms, in the context of recent cardiac event, raise the probability of a mitral regurgitation to 20%.

Upon physical examination, we find crackles at both lung bases, which are indicative of fluid accumulation due to left-sided heart failure. This could be a result of a mitral valve not closing properly, leading to backflow of blood into the lungs. This further increases the probability of mitral regurgitation to 30%.

He has a new grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur heard best at the cardiac apex, which is a typical finding in mitral regurgitation. This observation significantly increases the likelihood of mitral regurgitation to, perhaps, 75%.

His ECG shows sinus rhythm with T wave inversion in leads II, III, and aVF. T wave inversion can be seen in the setting of myocardial ischemia, but they don't specifically increase the likelihood of mitral regurgitation.

Overall, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is mitral regurgitation secondary to damage to the mitral valve apparatus (probably a papillary muscle) due to the recent myocardial infarction.",Answer: Mitral Regurgitation,Y
"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician because of excessive flow and duration of her menses. Since menarche a year ago, menses have occurred at irregular intervals and lasted 8–9 days. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago with passage of clots. She has no family or personal history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is at the 50th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Inadequate gonadotropin production,Menorrhagia,N,Anovulation,N,Dysfunctional uterine bleeding.,N,Anovulation,N,Dysfunctional uterine bleeding.,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 14-year-old girl who is having irregular, heavy and prolonged menstrual periods since her menarche. The fact that her periods are irregular and she is passing clots suggests that her hormonal system related to menstruation has not yet fully regulated, which is common in the first few years after menarche. This is usually due to the anovulatory cycles (cycles in which ovulation does not occur) that are common in adolescence. This condition is commonly known as adolescent menorrhagia, and it is typically a benign condition that improves with time as the hormonal regulation improves.",Answer: Adolescent Menorrhagia,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: anovulatory cycles, pregnancy, coagulation disorders, endometriosis, and hormonal imbalance. However, in this case, given the patient's age and the fact that she started menstruating only a year ago, and the absence of any significant personal or family medical history, it is quite likely that she is experiencing anovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles often occur in the first few years after menarche, while the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is still maturing. These cycles are characterized by irregular menstruation, excessive flow, and prolonged duration of menses, which are the symptoms this patient is experiencing. Pregnancy has been ruled out by a negative urine pregnancy test. Although other conditions can cause similar symptoms, the patient's age, history, and symptomology make anovulatory cycles the most likely diagnosis",Answer: Anovulatory cycles,N,"Rationale: This patient's menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding) and metrorrhagia (irregular intervals between periods) which began soon after menarche are suggestive of anovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles are common in the first few years after menarche due to immaturity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Without the progesterone-secreting corpus luteum that develops after ovulation, the endometrium proliferates under the influence of estrogen, leading to heavier and more prolonged menses (menorrhagia). The absence of cyclical progesterone also leads to irregular and often unpredictable menses (metrorrhagia).",Answer: Anovulatory cycles,N,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of irregular menses with excessive flow and duration, often including passage of clots, since menarche is suggestive of anovulatory cycles. This is quite common in the first few years following menarche because the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is not yet fully mature. With no ovulation, the endometrium is exposed to unopposed estrogen leading to proliferation and irregular, often heavy, and prolonged menstruation, known as menorrhagia. Other causes, such as coagulation disorders or structural abnormalities, are less likely given the lack of personal or family history of serious illness.",Answer: Anovulatory cycles,N,"Rationale: In this case, we start with the prior probability that the young girl has a condition called ""anovulatory cycles"", which is common in the first few years following menarche and can result in irregular and heavy menses. The prior probability is 30%.

The posterior probability changes as we add additional information:

Her age (14 years) and being within a year of menarche increases the probability to 45%. Adolescence is a common time for anovulatory cycles to occur, as the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis matures.
The irregularity of her menstrual cycles and the excessive flow/duration raise the probability to 60%. These symptoms align with the irregular, often prolonged, and sometimes heavy bleeding seen in anovulatory cycles.
The absence of any notable findings on physical examination and the negative pregnancy test further increase the probability to 70%. Many other potential causes of abnormal uterine bleeding would typically present with additional symptoms or positive physical exam findings (e.g., thyroid disorder, polycystic ovary syndrome, bleeding disorders, pregnancy, etc.).
Her lack of significant past medical history and her not being on any medications further eliminate other possible causes and raise the posterior probability to 80%.
Given all these factors, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is anovulatory cycles.

"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his mother to his pediatrician for headache and nausea. His headaches began approximately 3 weeks ago and occur in the morning. Throughout the 3 weeks, his nausea has progressively worsened, and he had 2 episodes of emesis 1 day ago. On physical exam, cranial nerves are grossly intact, and his visual field is intact. The patient has a broad-based gait and difficulty with heel-to-toe walking, as well as head titubation. Fundoscopy demonstrates papilledema. A T1 and T2 MRI of the brain is demonstrated in Figures A and B, respectively. What is most likely the diagnosis?",Medulloblastoma,Hydrocephalus,N,Hydrocephalus,N,Pseudotumor cerebri,N,Increased intracranial pressure,N,Brain tumor,Y,,"Rationale: This patient has several symptoms suggestive of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) including morning headaches, nausea, and papilledema seen on fundoscopy. Additionally, he is demonstrating signs of cerebellar dysfunction, such as a broad-based gait, difficulty with heel-to-toe walking, and head titubation. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination, precision, and accurate timing of movements. All of these point to a central nervous system lesion, most likely in the cerebellum. Given the history, the patient likely has a brain tumor - specifically a medulloblastoma, a common malignant brain tumor in children which often arises in the cerebellum. However, it's important to remember that without being able to see the actual MRI images, a definitive diagnosis based on this description alone is not fully accurate.",Answer: Medulloblastoma,Y,"Without the attached figures, it is challenging to provide a highly accurate diagnosis. However, based on the provided information, we can generate a differential diagnosis.

This 6-year-old boy is presenting with chronic headaches, particularly in the morning, progressively worsening nausea, vomiting, and signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as broad-based gait, difficulty with heel-to-toe walking, and head titubation. The presence of papilledema indicates increased intracranial pressure.

The differential diagnosis for this presentation includes cerebellar tumors, hydrocephalus, pseudotumor cerebri, and brain abscess, among others. In a child of this age with these symptoms and cerebellar signs, the most likely cause would be a cerebellar tumor, such as a medulloblastoma or astrocytoma. Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children and commonly presents with these symptoms. However, an exact diagnosis would require review of the imaging studies and possibly biopsy.",Answer: Medulloblastoma,Y,"Rationale: This patient's clinical presentation of morning headaches, progressive nausea and vomiting, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of papilledema and broad-based gait, are suggestive of increased intracranial pressure. The neurological findings, specifically the difficulties with heel-to-toe walking and the head titubation, suggest a lesion in the cerebellum, affecting coordination and balance. These symptoms together with MRI findings could suggest a posterior fossa tumor. The most common type of posterior fossa tumor in children is a medulloblastoma.",Answer: Medulloblastoma,Y,"The patient's presentation of headaches in the morning, worsening nausea, emesis, and the presence of papilledema all suggest increased intracranial pressure. Additionally, the child's ataxia (broad-based gait and difficulty with heel-to-toe walking) and head titubation suggest cerebellar dysfunction. These clinical features are classic for a posterior fossa tumor, which most commonly is a medulloblastoma in children.",Answer: Medulloblastoma,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of a posterior fossa tumor (like a medulloblastoma) in a child presenting with morning headaches, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia (evidenced by broad-based gait and difficulty with heel-to-toe walking) is approximately 5%. The addition of head titubation, which can be a sign of cerebellar dysfunction, increases the posterior probability to about 15%. Then, the papilledema observed on fundoscopy - a sign of increased intracranial pressure, can raise the probability further to around 25%. When we add the age of the child (medulloblastomas are most common in children), the posterior probability increases to 40%. Finally, if the MRI figures showed a mass in the posterior fossa, this would significantly increase the probability of the diagnosis to close to 80-90%.",Answer: Medulloblastoma.,Y
"Three days into hospitalization for a fractured distal femur, a 33-year-old man develops dyspnea and confusion. He has no history of a serious illness. He is unable to answer any questions or follow any commands. His blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg, the pulse is 120/min, the respiratory rate is 36/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F). His oxygen saturation is 90% on 80% FiO2. On examination, purpura is noted on the anterior chest, head, and neck. Inspiratory crackles are heard in both lung fields. Arterial blood gas analysis on 80% FiO2 shows:
pH 7.54
PCO2 17 mm Hg
PO2 60 mm Hg
HCO3− 22 mEq/L
A chest X-ray is shown. What best explains the cause of these findings?",Fat embolism,ARDS,N,Fat embolism,Y,Fat embolism,Y,Pulmonary embolism,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with dyspnea and confusion, signs of inadequate oxygen delivery to the brain, along with inspiratory crackles in both lung fields and an oxygen saturation of 90% on high-flow oxygen (80% FiO2), indicating significant hypoxemia. Additionally, purpura on his chest, head, and neck suggest a bleeding disorder or vascular damage. Furthermore, his arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis demonstrates a primary respiratory alkalosis (increased pH, decreased PCO2) with compensatory metabolic acidosis (normal HCO3- for this pH), which is consistent with hyperventilation and inadequate oxygen exchange. The prompt onset of these symptoms during his hospital stay after a leg fracture, along with the described findings, suggests the development of a Fat Embolism Syndrome, a potentially deadly complication of long bone fractures where fat globules migrate into the bloodstream and lodge within the pulmonary vasculature, leading to respiratory distress and potentially multi-organ failure.",Answer: Fat Embolism Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: fat embolism syndrome, pulmonary embolism, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). The clinical features of dyspnea, confusion, and purpura on the chest, head, and neck suggest fat embolism syndrome. Additionally, the timing is also typical of fat embolism, which usually occurs within 72 hours after a long bone fracture. Pulmonary embolism could cause dyspnea and hypoxia but would not usually lead to neurological symptoms or a petechial rash. Aspiration pneumonia and ARDS would not cause the purpura and are less likely in this scenario. Fat emboli from the marrow of the fractured femur can migrate to the lungs and brain causing respiratory distress, neurological signs, and a petechial rash.",Answer: Fat Embolism Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: This young patient's clinical picture of intermittent abdominal pain with drawing up of knees, mucus and blood in the stool, and a palpable 'sausage-shaped' mass in the right upper abdomen strongly suggests intussusception. Intussusception is a condition where a part of the intestine 'telescopes' into an adjacent part leading to obstruction and compromised blood flow. This condition is the most common cause of bowel obstruction in children between 6 months and 3 years of age. The most common etiology in this age group is idiopathic, although sometimes it may be precipitated by a viral illness causing hyperplasia of Peyer's patches in the ileum.",Answer: Idiopathic Intussusception,N,"Rationale: The patient's recent history of trauma (fractured distal femur), rapid onset of symptoms (dyspnea, confusion), the presence of purpura on the chest, head and neck, and the findings on the arterial blood gas analysis, which reveal a respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.54 and PCO2 17 mm Hg), are all highly suggestive of a fat embolism syndrome. Fat emboli may occur as a result of long-bone fractures (like the femur). The emboli can travel to the lungs, causing respiratory distress (dyspnea), and to the brain, leading to neurological symptoms such as confusion. Furthermore, fat emboli can also cause petechial rash (purpura), seen on the chest, head and neck in this case.",Answer: Fat Embolism Syndrome.,Y,"Rationale: The patient's presenting symptoms and blood gas analysis results suggest a condition that is causing hypoxemia, metabolic acidosis, and confusion. The anterior chest, head, and neck purpura and the presence of inspiratory crackles in both lung fields could suggest a thromboembolic event.

Let's consider fat embolism syndrome (FES), which has a prior probability of approximately 5% in patients with long bone fractures. The presence of dyspnea and confusion, typical symptoms of FES, increases the posterior probability to approximately 20%. Further, the observation of purpura on the anterior chest, head, and neck � a feature associated with FES � can increase the probability to about 50%. The presence of inspiratory crackles in both lung fields, indicative of a possible pulmonary involvement, can increase the probability to approximately 70%. Given the overall clinical scenario including a recent fracture (a risk factor for FES), the posterior probability of FES can be as high as 80-90%.",Answer: Fat embolism syndrome,Y
"A 24-year-old woman with a past medical history of anorexia nervosa presents to the clinic due to heavy menses, bleeding gums, and easy bruisability. She says she is trying to lose weight by restricting her food intake. She has taken multiple courses of antibiotics for recurrent sinusitis over the past month. No other past medical history or current medications. She is not sexually active. Her vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg, heart rate 100/min, respiratory rate 16/min. Her BMI is 16 kg/m2. Her physical examination is significant for ecchymosis on the extremities, dry mucous membranes, and bleeding gums. A gynecological exam is non-contributory. Laboratory tests show a prolonged PT, normal PTT, and normal bleeding time. CBC shows microcytic anemia, normal platelets, and normal WBC. Her urine pregnancy test is negative. What is the most likely cause of her condition?",Vitamin K deficiency,Vitamin K deficiency,Y,Vitamin K deficiency,Y,Vitamin K deficiency,Y,Vitamin K deficiency,Y,Vitamin K deficiency,Y,,"Rationale: This patient presents with signs of malnutrition (anorexia nervosa with a low BMI), recurrent infections (sinusitis), and symptoms of bleeding (heavy menses, bleeding gums, easy bruisability) that have arisen despite her having normal coagulation lab findings (prolonged PT, normal PTT, and normal bleeding time). This combination of symptoms and lab findings may indicate a deficiency of Vitamin C, also known as scurvy. Vitamin C is important for maintaining skin and vascular health and assists in iron absorption, which can help prevent anemia. It's also crucial for the immune system, and a deficiency can lead to an increased risk of infections, as is seen in this patient. A poor diet, especially due to her anorexia nervosa, may contribute to vitamin deficiency, as fresh fruits and vegetables are a primary source of Vitamin C.",Answer: Vitamin C deficiency,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnoses for this patient include vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, coagulation factor deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), von Willebrand's disease, and Hemophilia A or B. The patient's anorexia nervosa, antibiotics use, and the specific laboratory findings guide us to the most likely diagnosis. Antibiotic use can kill gut bacteria that produce vitamin K, which is necessary for the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S. In severe malnutrition due to anorexia nervosa, fat-soluble vitamin (including vitamin K) uptake can be compromised, leading to deficiency. Her prolonged PT (associated with factors II, VII, and X) but normal PTT (associated with factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII) suggests a deficiency in the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation, consistent with vitamin K deficiency. The fact that her bleeding time and platelet count are normal helps rule out platelet disorders and vascular causes. Her microcytic anemia might be a result of iron deficiency due to poor diet. In summary, her malnutrition coupled with antibiotic use likely led to a vitamin K deficiency causing her coagulopathy.",Answer: Vitamin K deficiency,Y,"Rationale: The patient has signs of bleeding and bruising with a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), suggesting a coagulation issue. This, combined with her history of anorexia nervosa (severe dietary restriction), could imply a vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and proteins C and S. These factors are necessary for proper blood clotting, and their deficiency results in prolonged PT. The microcytic anemia could be secondary to chronic blood loss due to the coagulopathy or due to iron deficiency, which can also be seen in cases of severe malnutrition like anorexia nervosa.",Answer: Vitamin K deficiency.,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with heavy menses, bleeding gums, easy bruisability, recurrent infections (sinusitis), and prolonged PT with normal PTT and bleeding time. These findings are indicative of Vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is a crucial factor in the activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X as well as proteins C and S, which are produced in the liver. With vitamin K deficiency, we see a prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) first, as factor VII has the shortest half-life among these factors. The normal PTT indicates that the intrinsic pathway (factors VIII, IX, XI, XII) is intact, which further supports vitamin K deficiency as the diagnosis. Additionally, her history of anorexia nervosa and restricted food intake, as well as recurrent use of antibiotics which can kill gut flora responsible for synthesizing vitamin K, contribute to her vitamin K deficiency.",Answer: Vitamin K deficiency,Y,"The prior probability of Vitamin K deficiency can be assumed to be low in the general population, perhaps 0.1%. However, the patient has several risk factors and signs that would significantly increase this probability. Firstly, she has a history of anorexia nervosa and is currently restricting her food intake (this may imply malnutrition and thus Vitamin K deficiency), which may increase the probability to around 10%. Secondly, her recent recurrent sinusitis treated with multiple courses of antibiotics can further increase the probability to 20%, as antibiotics can disrupt gut flora which synthesize vitamin K. Thirdly, her symptoms of heavy menses, bleeding gums, and easy bruisability, which are common signs of Vitamin K deficiency due to its role in clotting factor synthesis, might increase the probability to 40%. Additionally, the presence of a prolonged PT (prothrombin time) in the laboratory findings is indicative of a deficiency in Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, which can increase the probability to 60%. The normal PTT (partial thromboplastin time) and bleeding time could further support this, as Vitamin K deficiency primarily affects extrinsic and common pathways (reflected in PT), increasing the probability to 75%. This patient likely has Vitamin K deficiency.",Answer: Vitamin K deficiency,Y
"A previously healthy 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of upper back pain, dyspnea, and a sensation of pressure in his chest. He has had no shortness of breath, palpitations, fevers, or chills. He emigrated from Ecuador when he was 5 years old. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He takes no medications. He is 194 cm (6 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 70.3 kg (155 lb); BMI is 19 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 73/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 152/86 mm Hg in the right arm and 130/72 mg Hg in the left arm. Pulmonary examination shows faint inspiratory wheezing bilaterally. A CT scan of the chest with contrast is shown. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",Cystic medial necrosis,Pulmonary embolism,N,Chagas disease,N,Pulmonary embolism.,N,Pneumonia,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,,"Rationale: The patient's height, low weight, and symptoms can suggest a connective tissue disorder like Marfan syndrome.
Marfan syndrome can lead to conditions like aortic dissection.
The difference in blood pressure in the patient's arms may suggest a vascular issue, like aortic dissection.",Answer: Marfan syndrome or aortic dissection,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient could include heart-related conditions like angina, myocardial infarction or pericarditis, lung-related conditions like pneumonia, pneumothorax or pulmonary embolism, musculoskeletal issues like costochondritis, or other conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or panic disorder.

However, the clue to the most likely underlying condition lies in his physical attributes and his symptoms. His height (6 ft 4 in) is significantly taller than average and his BMI (19 kg/m^2) is on the lower end of the healthy range, suggesting a slender body habitus. This combination of features is often seen in Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that predisposes to aortic dissection and aneurysms.

The presence of high blood pressure (152/86 mm Hg) and a discrepancy in blood pressure readings between the right and left arm is also suggestive of a thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection. Disparities in blood pressure readings between arms may indicate aortic dissection. In addition, the symptoms of chest pressure and dyspnea could be explained by such a condition. A CT scan of the chest with contrast is typically used to diagnose aortic dissections or aneurysms, so it would presumably confirm this suspicion if it were available.",Answer: Marfan syndrome.,N,"Rationale: This patient is tall with low body weight and has a difference in blood pressure between his arms, suggestive of a vascular abnormality. His symptoms, such as dyspnea, chest pressure, and faint inspiratory wheezing, could be indicative of aortic dissection or a vascular anomaly such as coarctation of the aorta, which may cause hypertension due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys and systemic arteries. However, since the patient is not a child or adolescent (common age of presentation for coarctation of the aorta) and no classic findings such as weak/absent femoral pulses or a systolic murmur are reported, the aortic dissection becomes a more plausible condition. Aortic dissection is more common in men and can cause the different blood pressures in each arm depending on where the dissection occurs.",Answer: Aortic dissection,N,"Rationale: The patient has distinct features such as tall stature, low body weight, and upper body symptoms including chest pressure and back pain. These symptoms combined with his bilateral inspiratory wheezing and discrepancy in blood pressure between arms suggest a connective tissue disorder such as Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome can lead to thoracic aortic aneurysm or dissection which can present with symptoms described by the patient. The blood pressure discrepancy may be due to decreased blood flow to the left arm due to the aortic dissection. As the CT scan is not provided, the assumption is made based on the given information.",Answer: Marfan syndrome,N,"Rationale:  The prior probability for Marfan Syndrome in the general population is around 0.2%. The patient is exceptionally tall (194 cm) with a low body weight (70.3 kg) which can be signs of Marfan syndrome, increasing the probability to around 2%. The discrepancy between blood pressure in the right and left arms could be an indication of an aortic dissection, a common condition associated with Marfan syndrome, further increasing the probability to around 10%. Lastly, the faint inspiratory wheezing bilaterally might indicate pulmonary involvement, which is not uncommon in Marfan syndrome. This could bring the probability of Marfan syndrome up to around 20%.",Answer: Marfan Syndrome,N
"A 30-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of the sudden onset of back pain beginning 2 hours ago. Beginning yesterday, he noticed that his eyes started appearing yellowish and his urine was darker than normal. Two months ago, he returned from a trip to Greece, where he lived before immigrating to the US 10 years ago. Three days ago, he was diagnosed with latent tuberculosis and started on isoniazid. He has worked as a plumber the last 5 years. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows back tenderness and scleral icterus. Laboratory studies show:

What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's anemia?""",Absence of reduced glutathione,Hemolytic anemia,Y,Drug-induced hemolytic anemia,Y,Hemolytic anemia,Y,Hemolytic anemia,Y,Drug-induced hemolytic anemia,Y,,"Rationale: This patient presents with sudden onset back pain, jaundice (yellowish appearance of the eyes), and dark urine. His lab results indicate low hematocrit (anemia) and high total bilirubin, which is consistent with hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia occurs when red blood cells are broken down (hemolysis) faster than the body can produce new ones. His haptoglobin level is low, which is also consistent with hemolytic anemia, as haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin released from erythrocytes and thus its levels decrease when hemolysis occurs. The presence of blood in his urine (hematuria) also supports the occurrence of hemolysis. His recent history of starting isoniazid for latent tuberculosis is noteworthy, as isoniazid can cause a condition called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency to flare, leading to hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency is more prevalent in people of Mediterranean, African, and Asian descent, which fits this patient's demographic given his Greek origin. In G6PD deficiency, red blood cells are more susceptible to oxidative stress caused by certain medications (like isoniazid), infections, or foods (like fava beans).",Answer: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with sudden onset of back pain, scleral icterus (yellowing of the eyes), and dark urine, which suggests a possible hemolytic process. Hemolytic anemia could be the result of various conditions such as mechanical destruction (microangiopathic, valvular), immune-mediated destruction (autoimmune hemolytic anemia, drug-induced), infections (malaria, babesiosis), or metabolic causes (G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency).

In this case, there are some important considerations: The patient's recent history of starting on isoniazid for latent tuberculosis. Isoniazid can cause drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, but it usually does not cause intravascular hemolysis which is suggested by his dark urine (likely hemoglobinuria).
His recent travel history to Greece. There are certain infections like malaria and babesiosis endemic to certain areas, which can cause hemolytic anemia, but usually are accompanied by other symptoms like fever, which this patient doesn't have.
His occupation as a plumber does not typically expose one to agents that could cause hemolytic anemia.
Considering all this information, it is worth noting that the patient's symptoms started after he began treatment with isoniazid. Isoniazid is known to cause a syndrome of sideroblastic anemia in some cases, but not hemolytic anemia. However, the data provided does not suggest sideroblastic anemia (which typically would involve changes in iron studies). Therefore, a more likely cause of his hemolytic anemia could be a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.

G6PD deficiency can lead to episodic hemolytic anemia triggered by certain medications, foods, or infections. Isoniazid is one of the medications that can cause oxidative stress, leading to hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. This condition is an X-linked disorder, which means it is more common in males. Also, it's more prevalent in people of Mediterranean, African, and Southeast Asian descent. So, given the patient's gender and Greek origin, this diagnosis is plausible.

In the lab results, the presence of increased total bilirubin, decreased haptoglobin, and hemoglobinuria (indicated by blood in the urine) are indicative of hemolysis.

In conclusion, based on the symptoms, his recent initiation of isoniazid, his gender, and ethnicity, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's anemia is G6PD deficiency that has resulted in a hemolytic anemia episode.",Answer: G6PD deficiency,Y,"Rationale: This patient has recently started isoniazid treatment for latent tuberculosis, and now presents with sudden back pain, scleral icterus, dark urine, and low haptoglobin with relatively high bilirubin. These signs and symptoms, along with laboratory results indicating hematuria (urine blood 3+) and anemia (hematocrit 29%), suggest a process of intravascular hemolysis, likely secondary to a condition called G6PD deficiency. This condition is more common in individuals from Mediterranean countries, like Greece where this patient originally came from. Isoniazid is one of the drugs known to cause hemolytic anemia in people with G6PD deficiency.",Answer: G6PD deficiency,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with sudden onset of back pain, jaundice, dark urine, and anemia, which suggests intravascular hemolysis. This could be caused by a number of conditions, but the patient's recent initiation of isoniazid for latent tuberculosis treatment gives a clue. Isoniazid can cause drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia, but this is quite rare. However, given this patient's recent travel history to Greece, there's a high probability that he might have glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This condition is prevalent in Mediterranean populations and can lead to episodes of acute hemolysis in the face of oxidative stress, such as exposure to certain medications (like isoniazid), infections, or ingestion of fava beans. The low haptoglobin and elevated total bilirubin levels are consistent with hemolysis (as hemoglobin is released from red blood cells, it's bound by haptoglobin, leading to decreased haptoglobin levels). The presence of blood in the urine (hemoglobinuria) further suggests intravascular hemolysis.",Answer: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of isoniazid-induced hemolytic anemia is about 1% in the general population. The patient has just recently started treatment with isoniazid which raises the posterior probability to around 5%. The patient is also presenting with signs of hemolysis (jaundice, dark urine, low haptoglobin) which raises the posterior probability to around 20%. Furthermore, the laboratory findings include anemia (hematocrit of 29%) and elevated bilirubin, especially indirect bilirubin, which are indicative of hemolytic anemia, raising the posterior probability to 50%. Lastly, the patient has back pain which can be caused by rapid hemolysis and subsequent bilirubin gallstone formation, which raises the posterior probability to 80%. Therefore, this patient's anemia is most likely caused by hemolysis due to isoniazid therapy.",Answer: Isoniazid-induced hemolysis,Y
"A 69-year-old Caucasian man presents for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well. He has no significant past medical history. He takes aspirin for the occasional headaches that he has had for over several years. He exercises every day and does not smoke. His father was diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy at 79 years old. The patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL
Leukocyte count 62,000/mm3
Platelet count 350,000/mm3
A peripheral blood smear is obtained (shown on the image). What best explains these findings?",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Myeloproliferative disorder,N,Myeloproliferative disorder,N,Hematologic malignancy,N,Polycythemia vera,N,Polycythemia vera,N,,"Rationale:  The provided information shows that this patient has a significantly elevated leukocyte count (62,000/mm3), but otherwise normal hemoglobin and platelet levels. Given the normal physical examination and the fact that the patient is asymptomatic, this is suggestive of a chronic process. Moreover, the clue of a paternal history of hematologic malignancy also points towards a blood disorder. Although the image of the peripheral blood smear is not provided in the question, in the context of elevated white blood cells (leukocytosis) in an asymptomatic older adult, the most likely diagnosis is a type of chronic leukemia, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a common adult leukemia and often presents incidentally with lymphocytosis on routine labs in asymptomatic individuals. Other chronic leukemias, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), could also present in this way, but additional lab findings (such as an elevated platelet count, which is not seen here) or specific findings on the peripheral smear (like the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome) would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis. Without further information or the actual smear image, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made, but the information provided is most suggestive of CLL.",Answer: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Y,"Rationale: Given the clinical information provided, this patient may be suffering from conditions such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), lymphoma, infection, or an inflammatory condition. His father's hematologic malignancy history also raises suspicion for a genetic component to a potential blood disorder. However, infections or inflammation would likely present with other systemic signs such as fever, malaise or localized symptoms, which the patient doesn't report. Lymphoma usually presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, night sweats, or other systemic symptoms, again not reported in this case. The leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), in absence of such symptoms, particularly in an otherwise healthy older adult, most likely suggests CLL, which is a common adult leukemia characterized by a high number of mature-looking lymphocytes and often has a relatively indolent course. Unfortunately, the image of the peripheral blood smear is not provided, but a classic CLL smear would reveal a high number of small, mature lymphocytes and potentially smudge cells. Given the patient's age, lack of symptoms, and significantly elevated leukocyte count, CLL is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Y,"Rationale: This patient's lab results show elevated leukocyte count, but the lack of symptoms, the age, and family history of hematologic malignancy make CLL a likely diagnosis.",Answer: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The significantly elevated leukocyte count in the absence of symptoms or other abnormal physical findings in an older patient suggests a chronic process, such as a malignancy. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a common hematologic malignancy in older adults and often progresses slowly, possibly remaining asymptomatic for a long period. The patient's family history of a hematologic malignancy could also suggest a genetic predisposition.",Answer: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,Y,"Rationale: Starting with a prior probability of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) at 5%, the patient's age (69 years old) and ethnicity (Caucasian) increases the likelihood of CLL, taking the posterior probability to 20%. The leukocytosis (raised leukocyte count of 62,000/mm3) further increases the probability to 40%. The presence of mature lymphocytes in the peripheral blood smear (hypothetically, based on the question) would increase this to 70%. Lastly, the family history of hematologic malignancy further increases the posterior probability to a high chance of CLL.",Answer: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,Y
"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician with her husband because they have been trying to conceive for 15 months with no success. They have been sexually active at least twice a week. The husband sometimes has difficulties maintaining erection during sexual activity. During attempted vaginal penetration, the patient has discomfort and her pelvic floor muscles tighten up. Three years ago, the patient was diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder. There is no family history of serious illness. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She takes no medications. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows normal appearing vulva without redness; there is no vaginal discharge. An initial attempt at speculum examination is aborted after the patient's pelvic floor muscles tense up and she experiences discomfort. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Genitopelvic pain disorder,Vaginismus,Y,Vaginismus,Y,Vaginismus.,Y,Vaginismus,Y,Vaginismus,Y,,"Rationale: This patient is experiencing difficulties with conception, discomfort during vaginal penetration, and involuntary tightening of her pelvic floor muscles. All of these symptoms point towards a condition called vaginismus. Vaginismus is a condition involving a muscle spasm in the pelvic floor muscles, which can make sexual intercourse painful, difficult, or impossible. It's often linked with anxiety and fear of having sex, and in this case, could potentially be related to her history of body dysmorphic disorder. Given the symptoms and the fact that the speculum examination had to be aborted due to the patient's discomfort and pelvic floor muscles tension, vaginismus seems to be the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Vaginismus,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: vaginismus, vulvodynia, vestibulodynia, endometriosis, and psychological issues such as anxiety or past trauma. Endometriosis and vulvodynia would usually cause chronic pain, which is not reported by the patient. Vestibulodynia is a pain condition located at the entrance of the vagina, but the patient doesn't report localized pain. The fact that the patient's pelvic muscles tighten up during attempted penetration and she feels discomfort points toward vaginismus, which is an involuntary contraction of the muscles around the opening of the vagina, making penetration difficult or impossible. This can sometimes be associated with psychological factors such as body dysmorphic disorder. Therefore, this patient most likely has vaginismus.",Answer: Vaginismus,Y,"Rationale: This patient's difficulty with vaginal penetration and tightening of the pelvic floor muscles, along with associated discomfort, is indicative of vaginismus. Vaginismus is a sexual dysfunction characterized by the involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles that surround the vagina. It can be associated with sexual activity or any form of penetration, such as the insertion of a tampon or during a gynecological exam. It can be precipitated by various factors, including psychological issues such as anxiety, fear, or body dysmorphic disorder as in this patient. Therefore, this patient most likely has vaginismus.",Answer: Vaginismus,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of difficulty with penetration due to discomfort and involuntary tightening of the pelvic floor muscles are suggestive of a condition called vaginismus. Vaginismus is a sexual pain disorder characterized by involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles that surround the vagina, making vaginal penetration painful or impossible. It's often linked to anxiety or fear related to sexual intercourse. The fact that this patient also has a diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder, which is an anxiety disorder where a person can't stop thinking about perceived defects or flaws in their appearance, could potentially contribute to the anxiety surrounding intercourse, thus exacerbating the condition of vaginismus.",Answer: Vaginismus,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of vaginismus in a general population is approximately 2%. The patient's report of discomfort and tightening of pelvic floor muscles during attempted penetration increases the likelihood of vaginismus to around 20%. The reported history of body dysmorphic disorder could be relevant, and this increases the probability to 40%. Further, difficulties experienced during the speculum examination, consistent with the involuntary spasm of the muscles of the vaginal wall, increases the likelihood to approximately 70%. Given this data and history, it's most likely that the patient is suffering from vaginismus.",Answer: Vaginismus,Y
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of generalized fatigue, mild fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. She attended the state fair over a month ago, where she tried a number of regional foods, and wonders if it might have been caused by something she ate. She has also noticed darkening of her urine, which she attributes to not drinking enough water recently. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus. She drinks 1–2 beers daily. She works as nursing assistant in a rehabilitation facility. Current medications include glyburide, sitagliptin, and a multivitamin. She appears tired. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 99/min, and blood pressure is 110/74 mm Hg. Examination shows mild scleral icterus. The liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin and is tender. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.6 g/dL
Leukocyte count 11600/mm3
Platelet count 221,000/mm3
Serum
Urea nitrogen 26 mg/dL
Glucose 122 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.3 mg/dL
Bilirubin 3.6 mg/dL
Total 3.6 mg/dL
Direct 2.4 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 72 U/L
AST 488 U/L
ALT 798 U/L
Hepatitis A IgG antibody (HAV-IgG) positive
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive
Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc) positive
Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) positive
Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) negative
What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Active chronic hepatitis B infection,Hepatitis B,N,Hepatitis B,N,Acute hepatitis B,N,Hepatitis B,Y,Hepatitis B,Y,,"Rationale:  The patient has been experiencing fatigue, mild fever, abdominal pain, and nausea for the past three weeks, which, combined with her dark urine and mild scleral icterus, are symptoms suggestive of a liver-related condition. Furthermore, her liver is tender and enlarged, and her laboratory results show an increase in bilirubin, AST, and ALT levels, which are indicative of liver inflammation or damage. The hepatitis A IgG antibody being positive indicates that she has been infected with Hepatitis A in the past but doesn't necessarily mean she has a current infection.

However, the patient tests positive for the Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc), and Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg). The presence of HBsAg suggests an ongoing Hepatitis B infection. The anti-HBc being positive signifies a past or ongoing infection. The HBeAg is often used as a marker of high levels of replication of the virus. The fact that the Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) is negative rules out a Hepatitis C infection. Thus, the clinical and laboratory findings point towards a Hepatitis B infection.",Answer:  Hepatitis B infection,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnoses for this patient includes conditions such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholic hepatitis, or drug-induced hepatitis given her symptoms of fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, dark urine, and the finding of a tender liver. However, her hepatitis A IgG antibody is positive, which typically suggests past infection or vaccination, and she has negative hepatitis C antibody. Moreover, she is positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen, core IgG antibody, and envelope antigen. This combination of findings is indicative of an active hepatitis B infection. Alcoholic hepatitis is less likely given her relatively low alcohol intake, and there's no clear evidence of drug-induced hepatitis from the medications listed. Furthermore, the recent food intake at the state fair could suggest foodborne transmission, which is common for hepatitis A but not hepatitis B. However, she works in a healthcare setting (rehabilitation facility) where she might have come into contact with body fluids that could transmit hepatitis B. In light of this information, the most likely diagnosis is acute hepatitis B.",Answer: Acute Hepatitis B,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with generalized fatigue, mild fever, abdominal pain, nausea, dark urine, and mild scleral icterus - all of which can be indicative of a liver disease, likely hepatitis. The laboratory findings are key to determining the type of hepatitis. AST and ALT levels are substantially elevated, suggesting hepatocellular injury. Bilirubin levels are also elevated, which is why the patient has scleral icterus and dark urine. Her hepatitis serologies show that Hepatitis A IgG antibody is positive, which suggests a past infection or immunization. However, the patient is also positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc), and Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg). The combination of these results indicates an active Hepatitis B infection. HBeAg positivity suggests high viral replication and infectivity. Given these findings and her clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is acute Hepatitis B infection.",Answer: Acute Hepatitis B,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms of generalized fatigue, fever, abdominal pain, and nausea, in conjunction with darkening of the urine and mild scleral icterus, point towards liver involvement. The liver enlargement and tenderness further strengthens this suspicion. The liver function tests reveal significant elevations in the AST and ALT levels, and increased total and direct bilirubin, indicative of a hepatocellular damage and possible cholestasis. The positive results for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), Hepatitis B core IgG antibody (anti-HBc), and Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) confirm an active infection with Hepatitis B virus (HBV), which is known to cause such symptoms and laboratory findings. The Hepatitis A IgG antibody (HAV-IgG) positivity suggests a past infection or vaccination for Hepatitis A virus, and the negative result for Hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) rules out a Hepatitis C virus infection. Therefore, this patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with an active Hepatitis B infection.",Answer: Hepatitis B infection,Y,"Rationale: We start with the prior probability of Hepatitis B being the cause of her symptoms. According to global estimates, about 3.5% of the population has been infected with Hepatitis B, making the prior probability 0.035 or 3.5%.

The patient's history of attending a fair, potentially consuming contaminated food or drink, and her occupation as a nursing assistant (which involves potential exposure to bodily fluids) could all increase her likelihood of exposure to Hepatitis B. While these factors are not directly quantifiable, they would certainly increase the posterior probability of Hepatitis B.

The presence of general fatigue, mild fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and darkening of her urine are all consistent with acute hepatitis infection, further increasing the posterior probability of Hepatitis B.

The physical examination shows mild scleral icterus and tender liver, which are also signs of hepatitis, raising the posterior probability further.

Lastly, the laboratory findings confirm our hypothesis. The presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg) indicate current infection. The high levels of AST and ALT also suggest liver inflammation, which is consistent with acute hepatitis.

After considering all these steps, it is quite probable that this patient's symptoms are due to an acute Hepatitis B infection.",Answer: Acute Hepatitis B,Y
"A 74-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of abdominal pain that is most felt around the umbilicus. The pain began 16 hours ago and has no association with meals. He has not been vomiting, but he has had several episodes of bloody loose bowel movements. He was hospitalized 1 week ago for an acute myocardial infarction. He has had diabetes mellitus for 35 years and hypertension for 20 years. He has smoked 15–20 cigarettes per day for the past 40 years. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure is 95/65 mm Hg, and pulse is 95/min. On physical examination, the patient is in severe pain, there is a mild periumbilical tenderness, and a bruit is heard over the epigastric area. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute mesenteric ischemia,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,N,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,N,Mesenteric ischemia,Y,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,N,Mesenteric ischemia.,Y,,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms point to a severe gastrointestinal issue, possibly due to impaired blood supply to the intestines. The patient has a history of smoking, hypertension, and recently suffered a myocardial infarction (heart attack), all of which increase the risk of vascular disease, including in the arteries supplying the intestines. The sudden onset of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and the presence of a bruit over the epigastric area, which can suggest stenosis (narrowing) or occlusion of an artery, further point towards vascular insufficiency. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is mesenteric ischemia, which is a severe condition caused by reduced blood supply to the intestines. The abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings is a classic presentation.",Answer: Mesenteric Ischemia,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: acute mesenteric ischemia, peptic ulcer disease, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and aortic aneurysm. Given the patient's history of cardiovascular disease (recent myocardial infarction), long-standing diabetes, and smoking, he has a high risk for vascular diseases. The sudden onset of abdominal pain with bloody stools may suggest a vascular event in the bowel, such as acute mesenteric ischemia. This condition typically presents with severe pain out of proportion to physical findings. The presence of a bruit over the epigastric area may suggest stenosis of the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery, which further supports this diagnosis.",Answer: Acute mesenteric ischemia.,Y,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with sudden abdominal pain, bloody loose bowel movements, and a history of recent acute myocardial infarction. This clinical picture, together with his long-standing diabetes and hypertension, and his smoking history, makes him susceptible to atherosclerotic disease, including in the arteries supplying the intestines. A bruit over the epigastric area suggests turbulent blood flow due to arterial stenosis or occlusion. These signs and symptoms are consistent with mesenteric ischemia, likely due to an embolism or thrombosis in the mesenteric vessels, causing inadequate blood flow to the intestines.",Answer: Mesenteric Ischemia,Y,"Rationale: This patient's history of vascular risk factors (long-standing diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking) and recent myocardial infarction, along with his presentation of sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a bruit heard over the epigastric area suggest a diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia. The acute onset of symptoms aligns with an embolic event, as does the recent history of myocardial infarction. The epigastric bruit could indicate underlying atherosclerotic disease. The bloody diarrhea suggests bowel wall ischemia and potential necrosis. The abdominal pain out of proportion to physical findings is a classic presentation of mesenteric ischemia.",Answer: Acute mesenteric ischemia.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is quite suggestive of mesenteric ischemia, a condition characterized by abdominal pain that is out of proportion to the physical findings. The key indicators are as follows:

The prior probability of acute mesenteric ischemia in the general population is quite low, let's say about 1% given the lack of specific prevalence data. However, this changes when we consider this patient's specific context and symptoms:

Age > 60 years: This patient is 74 years old, which significantly increases the probability of mesenteric ischemia, let's say to about 10%. This condition is most common in the elderly due to the higher prevalence of atherosclerosis and other vascular diseases.

History of cardiovascular disease: This patient has a recent history of myocardial infarction, a key risk factor for mesenteric ischemia. This further increases the probability, perhaps to 30%.

Abrupt onset of severe abdominal pain: This is a hallmark symptom of mesenteric ischemia, further increasing the probability to 50%.

Presence of ""pain out of proportion"": The patient is in severe pain despite only mild tenderness being found on examination. This further increases the probability, let's say to 60%.

Bloody stools: This symptom suggests bowel ischemia, pushing the probability even higher, to perhaps 70%.

Presence of a bruit: This indicates turbulent blood flow, suggesting a possible stenosis or occlusion in the abdominal arteries. This brings the probability up further, to about 80%.

Considering all these factors, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is mesenteric ischemia.",Answer: Mesenteric Ischemia,Y
"A 59-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of episodic cough and shortness of breath. The cough is nonproductive and worsens when she climbs stairs and during the night. She has not had chest pain or palpitations. Eight weeks ago, she had fever, sore throat, and nasal congestion. She has a 10-year history of hypertension. She has smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 16 years. Her only medication is enalapril. Her pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Diffuse end-expiratory wheezes are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 65% and an FEV1 of 60%. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,COPD,N,COPD,N,Asthma,Y,Asthma,Y,COPD,N,,"Rationale: This patient presents with symptoms of a cough, shortness of breath (particularly during exercise and at night), and wheezing upon examination. She also has a history of smoking and hypertension, which are risk factors for chronic lung disease. Her spirometry results show a reduced FEV1:FVC ratio, suggesting an obstructive lung disease. Considering the patient's smoking history, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is commonly associated with smoking, and it often presents with symptoms like a persistent cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. The FEV1:FVC ratio is typically less than 70% in patients with COPD.",Answer: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), or a post-viral syndrome. Her smoking history, presentation of shortness of breath and cough, and spirometry findings that show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 65% and an FEV1 of 60% are highly suggestive of an obstructive lung disease. COPD is a strong consideration, but given her relatively short smoking history and episodic nature of her symptoms, particularly their worsening at night and with exercise, this scenario is more characteristic of asthma. An infectious cause is less likely given the duration of her symptoms and absence of fever or other signs of infection, and congestive heart failure is unlikely due to lack of other supportive symptoms such as edema or orthopnea. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is asthma.",Answer: Asthma,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presenting symptoms are a chronic cough and shortness of breath, especially during exertion and at night. The cough is nonproductive and has been persistent for over a month. The patient also has a significant history of smoking, which is a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and hypertension. Although she had an upper respiratory infection about two months ago, the current symptoms have been present for over a month and there are no indications of an ongoing infection. Her physical examination reveals diffuse end-expiratory wheezes, which are characteristic of COPD. Additionally, the spirometry results support this diagnosis; a ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 70% after bronchodilator use is diagnostic for COPD. In this patient, the ratio is already 65%, and her FEV1 (a measure of the severity of obstruction) is 60%, both suggesting moderate airflow obstruction. Although a chest X-ray doesn't confirm COPD, it helps rule out other differential diagnoses like pneumonia or lung cancer.",Answer: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,N,"Rationale: This patient's chronic history of cigarette smoking, coupled with her symptoms of episodic cough and shortness of breath that worsens with exertion and during the night, are classic for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is often caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. Her pulmonary auscultation finding of diffuse end-expiratory wheezes is also indicative of COPD. Furthermore, the spirometry result showing an FEV1:FVC ratio of less than 70% and a reduced FEV1 is indicative of airflow obstruction, a hallmark of COPD.",Answer: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),N,"Rationale: Starting with the prior probability, let's assume a general adult population has a 10% chance of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), considering the woman's age, long history of smoking, and presenting symptoms. The patient presents with a persistent cough and shortness of breath, especially on exertion, which increases the likelihood of COPD to 30%.

The spirometry result showing a reduced FEV1:FVC ratio (<70%) along with a reduced FEV1 (<80% of predicted), which indicates airflow obstruction, further increases the posterior probability to 70%. The chest x-ray showing no significant abnormalities might reduce the likelihood of other respiratory diseases, increasing the posterior probability of COPD to 85%. Given her history of hypertension and smoking, COPD becomes the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,N
"An 9-month-old infant is brought to the physician because of a generalized nonpruritic rash for 2 days. The rash began on her trunk and spread to her extremities. Five days ago, she was taken to the emergency department for fever of 40.5°C (104.9°F) and a 1-minute generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She was born at term and has no history of serious illness. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Current medications include acetaminophen. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F) and pulse is 120/min. Examination shows a maculopapular rash that blanches on pressure. A photograph of the rash is shown. Posterior auricular lymphadenopathy is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Roseola infantum,Roseola,Y,Roseola,Y,Roseola,Y,Roseola,Y,Roseola,Y,,"Rationale: The child in the scenario presented a fever and seizure, followed by the development of a rash starting from the trunk spreading to the extremities, and is currently febrile but without the high fever seen previously. Also, note the presence of posterior auricular lymphadenopathy. These symptoms are characteristic of Roseola, also known as exanthem subitum or sixth disease, which is typically caused by the human herpesvirus 6. The disease course usually starts with a high fever for several days, after which the fever breaks and a rash develops.",Answer: Roseola,Y,"The differential for this infant includes measles, roseola, rubella, and an allergic reaction. Measles often presents with a characteristic rash that begins at the hairline and spreads down, as well as with Koplik spots in the mouth, which aren't mentioned here. Roseola, also known as sixth disease, is characterized by high fever for a few days followed by a rash once the fever subsides, which matches the clinical presentation of this case. Rubella, also known as German measles, presents with a similar rash to roseola but is also associated with lymphadenopathy, particularly in the posterior auricular and occipital nodes. An allergic reaction is less likely as the rash is not described as being pruritic or hives-like. Given the high fever followed by the rash and the age of the child, this is most likely Roseola infantum.",Answer: Roseola infantum,Y,"Rationale: The infant's presentation of a fever followed by a generalized rash, in conjunction with posterior auricular lymphadenopathy, suggests a viral infection, specifically Roseola infantum (also known as sixth disease or exanthem subitum). Roseola is caused by the Human Herpesvirus 6 or occasionally Human Herpesvirus 7. This disease typically affects infants between the ages of 6 months and 2 years. The disease course begins with a high fever, often with febrile seizures, as seen in this infant. After the fever resolves, a characteristic pinkish-red, maculopapular, and blanching rash appears, initially on the trunk and then spreading to the limbs. The posterior auricular lymphadenopathy is a unique feature of this disease.",Answer: Roseola infantum,Y,"Rationale: The described presentation of high fever for several days followed by the appearance of a generalized rash as the fever resolves is characteristic of Roseola, also known as exanthem subitum or sixth disease. This is usually caused by human herpesvirus 6 or sometimes human herpesvirus 7. It commonly affects infants and young children, often between the ages of 6 months to 2 years. The disease typically starts with a sudden high fever which can cause febrile seizures, as noted in this case. After the fever subsides, a rash appears, which is often maculopapular and blanching, as described. The presence of posterior auricular lymphadenopathy further supports this diagnosis.",Answer: Roseola,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Roseola (also known as sixth disease or exanthem subitum) in infants is approximately 10% given its common occurrence in this age group. The history of a high fever followed by a generalized rash as the fever abates, which is characteristic of Roseola, increases the probability to 40%. The presence of a generalized nonpruritic maculopapular rash that began on the trunk and spread to the extremities further raises the probability to 60%. The additional finding of posterior auricular lymphadenopathy, which is sometimes associated with Roseola, increases the probability to 75%. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis for this child is Roseola.",Answer: Roseola,Y
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 5-day history of a rash on his chest and back. His mother initially noticed only a few lesions on his back, but since then the rash has spread to his chest. His family returned from a trip to the Caribbean 2 weeks ago. His mother started using a new laundry detergent 8 days ago. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. His mother has Hashimoto thyroiditis and his brother has severe facial acne. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 81/min, and blood pressure is 115/74 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows multiple, nontender, round, white macules on the chest and trunk. There is fine scaling when the lesions are scraped with a spatula. There are no excoriation marks. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",Increased growth of Malassezia globosa,Tinea versicolor,Y,Tinea versicolor,Y,Allergic reaction,N,Scabies,N,Tinea versicolor.,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a 5-day history of a rash on his chest and back. The lesions are round, white, and non-tender macules with fine scaling. This patient was recently in the Caribbean and the symptoms started a few days after the family returned, so a tropical disease might be considered. However, the most likely diagnosis based on the skin findings is pityriasis versicolor (tinea versicolor), a common skin infection caused by the fungus Malassezia furfur. The underlying mechanism of this condition involves the overgrowth of the yeast Malassezia on the skin, leading to the development of hypopigmented or hyperpigmented macules and patches. This yeast is part of the normal skin flora, but under certain conditions such as high humidity or immunosuppression, it can overgrow and cause the characteristic rash.",Answer: Malassezia overgrowth,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: contact dermatitis, sunburn, tinea versicolor, pityriasis rosea, and vitiligo. Given the history of recent travel to the Caribbean, the presence of round, white macules that are fine and scale when scraped, and no other signs of systemic illness, the most likely diagnosis is tinea versicolor. Tinea versicolor is caused by the overgrowth of Malassezia species, a yeast that is part of the normal skin flora. The overgrowth is usually triggered by factors such as humid weather, immunosuppression, or hormonal changes, and results in areas of hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation.",Answer: Overgrowth of Malassezia species,Y,"Rationale: This 13-year-old boy presents with a history of a spreading rash on his chest and back. The rash consists of multiple, round, white macules which exhibit fine scaling when scraped - these are characteristic features of Tinea versicolor. Tinea versicolor is a common superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia species, which are part of the normal skin flora. This fungus exists in both yeast and mycelial forms, and the conversion of yeast to pathogenic mycelial form is believed to be triggered by various factors such as heat, humidity (as could be experienced on a Caribbean trip), and immunosuppression. The fungus interferes with the normal pigmentation of the skin, resulting in either hyperpigmented or hypopigmented areas. The lesions may become more apparent after sun exposure because they do not tan like the rest of the skin.",Answer: Fungal infection (Tinea versicolor),Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms suggest a diagnosis of tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection of the skin caused by an overgrowth of Malassezia species, a yeast that normally lives on the skin. The infection can cause lighter or darker patches on the skin, often with fine scaling. Malassezia yeasts metabolize the lipids in the stratum corneum, leading to the production of dicarboxylic acids, which inhibit tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in the production of melanin. This results in hypopigmentation in the areas affected by the fungus. The history of recent travel to a warm, humid climate (the Caribbean) is consistent with this diagnosis, as Malassezia species thrive in such environments.",Answer: Malassezia overgrowth,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of tinea versicolor is 10% in general but given the presentation of multiple, nontender, round, white macules with fine scaling when scraped, the posterior probability of tinea versicolor goes up to 60%. Given the recent travel to a warm, tropical area (the Caribbean) where tinea versicolor is more common, the probability further increases to 80%. The appearance of the rash shortly after a change in laundry detergent is less likely to be the cause as the rash is not itchy, lacks excoriation marks, and presents as round white macules rather than an erythematous reaction we'd expect with contact dermatitis. This pattern of presentation supports the likelihood that the patient has tinea versicolor, a fungal infection, which causes an overgrowth of the Malassezia species on the skin.",Answer: Overgrowth of Malassezia species.,Y
"A 67-year-old man presents to the emergency department with trouble urinating. The patient states that in general he has had difficulty urinating but recently, it has taken significant effort for him to initiate a urinary stream. He finds himself unable to completely void and states he has suprapubic tenderness as a result. These symptoms started suddenly 3 days ago. The patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, constipation, and diabetes mellitus. His current medications include finasteride, sodium docusate, and hydrochlorothiazide. He recently started taking phenylephrine for seasonal allergies. The patient’s last bowel movement was 2 days ago. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 167/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 100% on room air. Physical exam is notable for suprapubic tenderness, and an ultrasound reveals 750 mL of fluid in the bladder. What is the most likely etiology of this patient’s symptoms?",Medication induced symptoms,Acute urinary retention,N,Urinary retention,N,Urinary retention,N,Bladder outlet obstruction,N,Acute urinary retention,N,,"Rationale: This patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is a common cause of urinary obstruction in older men. He has sudden difficulty initiating urination and has suprapubic tenderness, suggestive of urinary retention. This could be precipitated by medications, and in this case, the patient recently started taking phenylephrine. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic drug and can cause urinary retention by inducing smooth muscle contraction in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to increased resistance to urinary flow. The ultrasound revealing 750 mL of fluid in the bladder confirms that the patient is not able to void completely, supporting the diagnosis of urinary retention.",Answer: Phenylephrine-induced urinary retention,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), urinary tract infection (UTI), bladder stones, prostate cancer, or drug-induced urinary retention. The patient's history of BPH, the sudden onset of his symptoms, and his recent start of phenylephrine (a medication known to cause urinary retention due to its alpha-adrenergic agonist action causing constriction of the urinary sphincter and prostate muscle) point to drug-induced urinary retention. His symptoms of difficulty initiating urination, incomplete voiding, and suprapubic tenderness, along with the ultrasound finding of significant fluid in the bladder, support this. Although he has a history of BPH, his symptoms started suddenly after the initiation of phenylephrine and are more severe, making this the more likely cause rather than a simple exacerbation of his BPH. In contrast, UTI and bladder stones would likely present with additional symptoms such as dysuria or hematuria, and prostate cancer would typically have a more insidious onset.",Answer: Phenylephrine-induced urinary retention.,Y,"Rationale: This patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which can cause difficulties in initiating a urinary stream and incomplete voiding due to the enlarged prostate compressing the urethra. The patient's condition was likely exacerbated by the introduction of phenylephrine. Phenylephrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist, which can cause contraction of the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, leading to urinary retention, especially in individuals with BPH. The finding of suprapubic tenderness and ultrasound revealing 750 mL of fluid in the bladder further support the diagnosis of acute urinary retention.",Answer: Phenylephrine-induced urinary retention.,Y,"Rationale: The patient has a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a condition which can already cause difficulty with urination due to enlargement of the prostate gland and subsequent obstruction of the urethra. However, his symptoms have acutely worsened, which suggests another precipitating factor. He recently started taking phenylephrine for his allergies. Phenylephrine is a sympathomimetic drug, which can cause an increase in smooth muscle tone in the bladder neck and prostate leading to urinary retention. The fact that this patient already has BPH would make him more susceptible to the effects of this drug. The suprapubic tenderness and ultrasound revealing a significant amount of fluid in the bladder strongly support the diagnosis of acute urinary retention, most likely precipitated by his recent use of phenylephrine.",Answer: Phenylephrine-induced urinary retention.,Y,"The prior probability of urinary retention due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) exacerbation in this patient is 20% given his history of BPH. The sudden onset of symptoms 3 days ago along with the difficulty in initiating a urinary stream increases the posterior probability to 40%. His use of phenylephrine, a medication known to potentially worsen urinary symptoms in men with BPH, further raises the posterior probability to 60%. The presence of suprapubic tenderness and significant post-void residual volume found on ultrasound pushes the probability of urinary retention due to BPH exacerbation to 80%. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is exacerbation of BPH leading to urinary retention.",Answer: Exacerbation of BPH,N
"A 41-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for an annual pelvic examination and Pap smear. Over the past year she has been feeling healthy. She is sexually active and uses an intrauterine device with copper for contraception. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. She is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 88 kg (194 lb); BMI is 34.4 kg/m2. Bimanual pelvic examination shows an irregularly enlarged uterus. A transvaginal ultrasound reveals a singular 4 cm, hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall. What is the most likely cause of this finding?",Leiomyoma,Uterine leiomyoma,Y,Uterine leiomyoma,Y,Leiomyoma,Y,Uterine fibroid,Y,Uterine fibroid,Y,,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes leiomyoma (fibroid), adenomyosis, endometrial polyp, endometrial cancer, and uterine sarcoma. The ultrasound shows a hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall, which is suggestive of a leiomyoma or adenomyosis. The solitary nature of the mass and its well-defined borders are more typical of a leiomyoma. Endometrial polyp usually appears as a focal mass within the endometrial cavity and thus is less likely. Endometrial cancer usually presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, which this patient doesn't have, and uterine sarcoma is very rare and typically occurs in older women, making leiomyoma the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Leiomyoma (Fibroid),Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with an irregularly enlarged uterus, and transvaginal ultrasound has revealed a singular 4 cm, hypoechoic mass inside the myometrial wall. This presentation is suggestive of a leiomyoma, also known as a uterine fibroid. Leiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus, and are commonly found in reproductive-age women. They are often asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and can sometimes result in an enlarged uterus palpable during a pelvic exam. They appear as hypoechoic masses on ultrasound. Risk factors include nulliparity, obesity (as indicated by her BMI of 34.4 kg/m2), and African American race. Smoking is generally considered to reduce the risk of fibroids, which is contrary to its usual role as a risk factor for many diseases.",Answer: Uterine Leiomyoma (Fibroid),Y,"Rationale: This patient's irregularly enlarged uterus and the presence of a hypoechoic mass within the myometrial wall suggests the presence of a uterine fibroid, also known as leiomyoma. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of smooth muscle origin and are commonly seen in women of reproductive age. Risk factors for developing fibroids include early menarche, nulliparity, obesity, and possibly smoking - all factors which apply to this patient. Importantly, the presence of a singular mass within the myometrial wall is a common presentation for a fibroid.",Answer: Uterine fibroid,Y,"Rationale:  Step 1: Begin with the prior probability. In this case, let's consider the prior probability of uterine leiomyoma (fibroids) in a premenopausal woman, which is estimated to be around 20-40%.

Step 2: Add in the fact that the patient is a heavy smoker. Smoking is inversely related to the risk of uterine fibroids, which could slightly decrease the posterior probability, let's say down to around 15-35%.

Step 3: Now consider the finding of a singular, hypoechoic mass in the myometrial wall on ultrasound, which is consistent with a uterine fibroid. This could increase the probability significantly, possibly up to 70-90%.

Step 4: Lastly, the fact that the patient has an irregularly enlarged uterus on examination further supports the likelihood of uterine fibroids, potentially raising the probability to the higher end of our estimated range, say around 85-95%.

Considering these factors, the most likely cause of this finding in this patient is a uterine leiomyoma.",Answer: Uterine leiomyoma (fibroid),Y,"The prior probability of uterine leiomyoma (fibroid) in a woman of reproductive age is about 20-40%. However, in this case, the woman has several factors that increase this probability. First, the fact that she is nulliparous - not having given birth to any children - increases the posterior probability of uterine leiomyoma to around 25-45%. Next, she has been smoking for 20 years; while smoking is generally considered to decrease the risk of fibroids, the relationship isn't entirely clear and does not conclusively rule out a fibroid. The discovery of an irregularly enlarged uterus on bimanual pelvic examination further increases the probability of a leiomyoma to about 40-60%. Finally, a transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 4 cm, hypoechoic mass within the myometrial wall, which is consistent with a leiomyoma, thus further increasing the probability to about 70-90%. Given these factors, this woman likely has a uterine leiomyoma.",Answer: Uterine Leiomyoma.,Y
"A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for pain when he walks. He states that the pain is the worst in his left great toe but is also present in his hips and knees. He says that his symptoms are worse with activity and tend to improve with rest. His symptoms have progressively worsened over the past several years. He has a past medical history of obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension. He drinks roughly ten beers per day. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient has a recent travel history to Bangkok where he admits to having unprotected sex. On physical exam, examination of the lower extremity results in pain. There is crepitus of the patient's hip when his thigh is flexed and extended. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Osteoarthritis,Septic arthritis,N,Osteoarthritis,Y,Septic arthritis,N,Osteoarthritis,Y,Septic arthritis,N,,"Rationale: The patient presents with pain that is worst in his great toe but also present in his hips and knees. The pain is worse with activity and improves with rest, and it has been progressively worsening over the past several years. These are typical symptoms of osteoarthritis, which is a type of joint disease that results from the breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. The patient's obesity and age are risk factors for osteoarthritis. Crepitus of the hip, which refers to a grating or crackling sound or sensation (often described like the crunching of a joint), is also a common finding in osteoarthritis.

Furthermore, the travel history and unprotected sex could be related to a sexually transmitted infection, but it wouldn't typically present with these specific joint symptoms. His diabetes, hypertension, and high alcohol consumption are also important health factors but are not directly causing his current symptoms.",Answer: Osteoarthritis,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: gout, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, sexually transmitted infection leading to reactive arthritis, or peripheral vascular disease. This patient's symptoms of joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest, as well as the presence of crepitus on physical examination, is suggestive of osteoarthritis. The fact that the pain is worst in the weight-bearing joints such as the hips, knees, and big toe, and the progressive worsening of symptoms over several years further point towards osteoarthritis. Gout could also be considered given the involvement of the great toe and the patient's alcohol use, but gout tends to present with sudden onset of severe pain, not a gradual worsening. While the patient's recent travel history and unprotected sex could raise the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection leading to reactive arthritis, this would not typically present with crepitus, and the distribution of pain does not fit as well. Rheumatoid arthritis generally affects smaller joints first, and peripheral vascular disease would not cause joint pain or crepitus. Thus, the patient most likely has osteoarthritis.",Answer: Osteoarthritis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is characteristic of osteoarthritis, which is common in older individuals and is associated with obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. It manifests as joint pain that is worse with activity and improves with rest. The presence of crepitus in the hip upon movement is also suggestive of osteoarthritis. The symptoms have been progressively worsening over several years, which is consistent with the chronic and progressive nature of osteoarthritis. The patient's recent travel history and unprotected sex are red herrings in this case and do not directly contribute to his presenting symptoms.",Answer: Osteoarthritis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's progressive joint pain, particularly in weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees, worsened with activity and improved with rest, along with crepitus noted during the hip examination, strongly suggests osteoarthritis. His advanced age, obesity, and history of smoking are risk factors for osteoarthritis. Pain in the great toe could be indicative of gout, especially given his high alcohol intake, which is a risk factor for gout. However, gout usually presents with acute, not progressive, pain, and it typically does not cause crepitus, which is a feature of osteoarthritis. His travel history and unprotected sex are risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, but these are unlikely to cause his joint symptoms unless they've led to a reactive arthritis, which is less likely than osteoarthritis given his symptoms and risk factors.",Answer: Osteoarthritis,Y,"The prior probability of osteoarthritis is quite high given the patient's age, being about 25%. The patient's symptoms of pain in his great toe, hips, and knees that worsen with activity and improve with rest increase the posterior probability of osteoarthritis to 40%. The presence of crepitus in the hip during flexion and extension increases the probability further to 60%. His history of obesity, a known risk factor for osteoarthritis, raises the probability to 70%. The fact that he has type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and is a smoker, further increase the risk of osteoarthritis to 80%. His alcohol consumption (ten beers a day) and recent travel history with unprotected sex could potentially be red herrings in this scenario, as these factors do not align with the clinical picture of osteoarthritis and may lead the examiner away from the correct diagnosis. Given these factors, this patient most likely has osteoarthritis.",Answer: Osteoarthritis,Y
"A 51-year-old woman presents to your office with 2 weeks of fatigue and generalized weakness. She has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and started on disease-modifying therapy. She states she has felt less able to do things she enjoys and feels guilty she can't play sports with her children. Review of systems is notable for the patient occasionally seeing a small amount of bright red blood on the toilet paper. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 7,700/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 207,000/mm^3
MCV: 110 fL

What is the most likely etiology of this patient's fatigue?",Medication side effect,Anemia,N,Anemia,N,Anemia,N,Anemia,N,Anemia,N,,"Rationale: The differential for this patient's symptoms includes iron-deficiency anemia (potentially from occult gastrointestinal bleeding), anemia of chronic disease (also known as anemia of inflammation, which could be due to her rheumatoid arthritis), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or potentially a side effect from the disease-modifying therapy she recently started.

However, when considering her laboratory values, her Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is 110 fL which is elevated (normal range is approximately 80-100 fL). This means her red blood cells are larger than normal, indicating a macrocytic anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia usually presents with microcytic (small red blood cells) anemia and anemia of chronic disease usually presents with normocytic (normal size red blood cells) anemia, so these are less likely.

Her anemia and her gastrointestinal symptoms raise the suspicion for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Folate deficiency is often associated with poor diet, alcoholism or malabsorption conditions which don't appear prominent in this patient's history. Vitamin B12 deficiency, on the other hand, can be seen in patients with poor absorption, pernicious anemia, or dietary deficiency. Since she doesn't have any signs of severe malabsorption and her diet isn't mentioned, the most likely cause, given the presented information, is Vitamin B12 deficiency.",Answer: Vitamin B12 deficiency,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for fatigue and generalized weakness is quite broad and includes conditions like anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes complications, depression, rheumatoid arthritis itself, and side effects of medications, among others. The recent start of disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, however, could indicate a side effect of her medication, which should be considered.

Nevertheless, her lab results indicate a macrocytic anemia (Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) >100 fL, and hemoglobin and hematocrit below the normal range for women). Anemia is a common cause of fatigue and generalized weakness. There are several types of anemia and one of them is due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, which can cause macrocytic anemia.

The patient has also reported occasional bright red blood on the toilet paper. Though this symptom can suggest hemorrhoids, anal fissures or colorectal cancer, it may also signify a gastric or duodenal ulcer especially if she's taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding leading to iron deficiency anemia. However, iron deficiency typically results in microcytic (not macrocytic) anemia.

Given the lab results and the symptoms, the most probable cause of the patient's fatigue is macrocytic anemia. This could be due to a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate which are both necessary for proper red blood cell development.",Answer: Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency,Y,"The differential for this patient includes anemia, depression, hypothyroidism, diabetes-related fatigue, and medication side effect. The patient's hemoglobin is 12 g/dL, which is low normal and does not typically cause symptoms unless there is an acute drop. Her hematocrit is 36%, again low normal but not necessarily indicative of symptomatic anemia. However, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 110 fL, indicating macrocytosis, which can be due to a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, or certain medications (like hydroxyurea or antiretroviral therapy). Given the patient's presentation, her macrocytic anemia could be attributed to a deficiency of B12 or folate, especially if her rheumatoid arthritis therapy includes methotrexate, which can cause folate deficiency.

This patient's history of occasional bright red blood on the toilet paper might suggest hemorrhoidal or rectal bleeding, but the macrocytic anemia is not consistent with an iron deficiency anemia that might be expected with gastrointestinal blood loss. Finally, the fatigue and decreased enjoyment in activities could potentially indicate depression, a common co-morbidity in patients with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. However, this is less likely given the laboratory findings. The best explanation for the fatigue given the patient's history and labs is likely B12 or folate deficiency causing macrocytic anemia.",Answer: B12 or Folate deficiency,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with fatigue and generalized weakness. The patient's lab results indicate a macrocytic anemia, given the high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 110 fL (normal range is approximately 80-100 fL). Macrocytic anemia can be caused by various factors including vitamin B12 deficiency, folate deficiency, alcoholism, hypothyroidism, and certain medications. Given the absence of other symptoms like neurological symptoms (associated with B12 deficiency), the recent initiation of a disease-modifying therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, and the observation of occasional bright red blood on the toilet paper (indicative of potential gastrointestinal bleeding), the fatigue could be due to macrocytic anemia likely caused by medication (e.g., methotrexate) used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis which can cause both macrocytosis and gastrointestinal bleeding.",Answer: Medication-induced macrocytic anemia,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with fatigue, generalized weakness, and notable for occasional bright red blood when she wipes, which may suggest bleeding. The laboratory findings show a microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume or MCV of 110 fL is above the normal range of 80-100 fL), which can result from a variety of causes including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, and alcoholism. However, given her symptoms and the history of seeing bright red blood on the toilet paper, the most likely cause for her fatigue is anemia secondary to chronic blood loss. Occult gastrointestinal bleeding can lead to iron deficiency anemia over time, but when the iron stores are sufficiently depleted, the bone marrow produces larger and fewer red blood cells leading to a macrocytic (high MCV) picture.",Answer: Anemia due to chronic blood loss,N
"A previously healthy 17-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for further evaluation after elective removal of his wisdom teeth. During the procedure, the patient had persistent bleeding from the teeth's surrounding gums. Multiple gauze packs were applied with minimal effect. The patient has a history of easy bruising.

Peripheral blood smear shows normal-sized platelets. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Hemophilia,Von Willebrand Disease,Y,Von Willebrand disease,Y,Glanzmann thrombasthenia,N,Von Willebrand disease,Y,Bernard-Soulier Syndrome,N,,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms and history of easy bruising, along with a relative with similar symptoms, suggest a potential bleeding disorder. A key detail in the lab findings is the prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) and normal platelet count. The PTT measures the function of the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways, while PT measures the extrinsic pathway. Given that the PTT is prolonged while the PT is normal, this implies a problem with the intrinsic pathway. Since this patient is otherwise healthy and young, the most likely diagnosis would be Hemophilia A or B. Hemophilia A is due to a deficiency of factor VIII and is more common than Hemophilia B, which is due to a deficiency of factor IX.",Answer: Hemophilia A,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: Von Willebrand disease, Hemophilia A or B, factor XI deficiency, or a platelet function defect. The patient's prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time, along with a history of easy bruising and family history of bleeding, is suggestive of a coagulation factor deficiency rather than a platelet problem. Since hemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive disorders and are more common in males, these should be high on the differential diagnosis. The lack of joint bleeds would make Von Willebrand disease less likely. The family history of a similar bleeding disorder in his maternal uncle also makes an X-linked disorder more likely. Based on these considerations, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Hemophilia A or B.",Answer: Hemophilia A or B.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's history of easy bruising, persistent bleeding following a dental procedure, a familial history of similar bleeding problems, and a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal platelet count, prothrombin time, and bleeding time, all point towards a coagulation factor deficiency. The prolonged PTT suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common pathway of coagulation, which includes factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. Given the history of joint swelling and the gender (male) of the patient, the most likely diagnosis would be Hemophilia A or B, which are caused by deficiencies in factor VIII and IX, respectively. Hemophilia A is more common than Hemophilia B, thus making it the more probable diagnosis in this scenario.",Answer: Hemophilia A,Y,"Rationale: This patient's history of easy bruising, post-extraction bleeding, and a family history of similar symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder. The laboratory results show a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), but a normal prothrombin time (PT) and bleeding time. The PTT test evaluates the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways, while the PT test evaluates the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways. The isolated prolongation of the PTT suggests a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, which includes factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. The normal platelet count and bleeding time suggest that primary hemostasis is intact, which would be expected in hemophilia. Given the patient's gender and age, along with his family history (his maternal uncle has similar symptoms), hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) is the most likely diagnosis. Of these two, hemophilia A is far more common.",Answer: Hemophilia A,Y,"Rationale: Starting with the prior probability, the likelihood of a previously healthy 17-year-old boy having a bleeding disorder like hemophilia is quite low, around 1 in 10,000 males. However, this probability changes in light of several pieces of new evidence.

First, the persistent bleeding after a dental procedure increases the likelihood of a bleeding disorder. Although the exact degree of increase is hard to quantify without specific data, let's conservatively estimate it doubles the likelihood to 1 in 5,000.

Next, the fact that the patient has a history of easy bruising and a familial history of similar symptoms, specifically in a male relative, increases the likelihood further. These symptoms are often seen in inherited bleeding disorders like hemophilia, which are passed down through X-linked recessive inheritance. This might increase the likelihood by a factor of 10, giving a rough estimate of 1 in 500.

The laboratory findings also provide crucial information. The normal platelet count and bleeding time rule out disorders of platelet quantity and function. The normal prothrombin time suggests that the extrinsic and common clotting pathways are functioning normally. However, the prolonged partial thromboplastin time indicates a possible problem with the intrinsic and common pathways, which would be seen in hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency) or B (Factor IX deficiency). This could increase our estimate to 1 in 50.

Finally, the lack of abnormalities in the peripheral blood smear and other lab results further rule out other possible causes, which makes a diagnosis of hemophilia more likely. This could bring our final estimate to around 1 in 10, suggesting this boy likely has hemophilia.",Answer: Hemophilia,Y
"A 47-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a rash. He states the rash started last night and is very concerning to him. The patient cannot remember being exposed to any environmental stimuli such as new detergents or poison ivy. The patient recently started following with a primary care provider who is helping him manage his arthritis and a new onset cough. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for the findings of coalescing erythematous macules, bullae, desquamation, and mucositis only on the upper half of his back. Cardiopulmonary exam and abdominal exam are within normal limits. Inspection of the patient’s oropharynx reveals ulcers and erythema. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Steven Johnson syndrome,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,Y,,"Rationale: The patient presents with erythematous macules, bullae, desquamation (skin peeling), and mucositis (inflammation of the mucous membranes) only on the upper half of his back, along with oropharyngeal ulcers and erythema. These findings suggest a dermatological issue that's affecting the skin and mucous membranes. The pattern of the rash, which is localized to the upper half of the back, combined with the patient's symptoms of a new-onset cough, point to a medication-induced reaction known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). SJS often begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters, eventually leading to the top layer of skin dying, shedding and then healing. In some cases, it's induced by medications, particularly those used for treating conditions like arthritis.",Answer: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), fixed drug eruption, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS).

Given the presentation of coalescing erythematous macules, bullae, desquamation, and mucositis localized to the upper back, as well as oropharyngeal ulcers and erythema, this is likely to be a severe cutaneous drug reaction. The patient's recent history of new medical management, including for his arthritis and cough, is a pertinent clue that a new medication might be the offending agent.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome usually affects children and presents as widespread desquamation with a positive Nikolsky sign (epidermis separates with slight rubbing). There is no mention of this patient having a positive Nikolsky sign.

Fixed drug eruption typically presents as a solitary well-demarcated erythematous patch or plaque that recurs at the same site each time the drug is taken. This patient's rash is not solitary or well-demarcated, making this diagnosis unlikely.

DRESS syndrome usually presents 2 to 8 weeks after drug exposure with fever, rash, eosinophilia, and involvement of at least one internal organ. The patient's presentation does not include these features, making DRESS unlikely.

Both SJS and TEN present with widespread mucocutaneous involvement and can have mucous membrane involvement like this patient. The key difference between SJS and TEN is the body surface area involved. SJS involves less than 10% of body surface area, whereas TEN involves more than 30%. The patient's rash appears to be localized to his upper back, which would be less than 10% of body surface area, making SJS the more likely diagnosis.",Answer: Stevens-Johnson syndrome,Y,"Rationale: This patient has erythematous macules, bullae, desquamation, and mucositis on the upper half of his back, along with oral ulcers and erythema, which suggest the diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). SJS is often triggered by medications or infections, and is a serious systemic disorder that involves the skin and mucous membranes. The recent onset cough and new management of arthritis could possibly point towards a new medication being started which could have precipitated this.",Answer: Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: This patient's skin findings of erythematous macules, bullae, desquamation, and mucositis, in conjunction with his oropharyngeal ulcers and erythema, are indicative of Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS). SJS is a serious systemic disorder with mucocutaneous symptoms that can be induced by medications, infections, or in rare cases, malignancies. Given that the patient has a new onset cough and is seeing a primary care provider for arthritis management, it is likely he has been started on some new medications. Many common medications used to treat these conditions, such as NSAIDs or antibiotics, are known potential triggers for SJS. His tachycardia could be a response to the systemic inflammation and the discomfort caused by the lesions.",Answer: Steven-Johnson Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) in the general population is relatively low, at around 0.05%. However, this patient has several symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The presence of erythematous macules and bullae raises the posterior probability of SJS to about 5%. Further increasing this probability is the presence of desquamation, which can be seen in SJS, thus raising the posterior probability to approximately 15%. The occurrence of mucositis, in this case presenting as oropharyngeal ulcers and erythema, is a key symptom of SJS and raises the posterior probability to 50%. Additionally, the symptom of new-onset cough might indicate potential involvement of respiratory mucosa seen in SJS, which further increases the posterior probability to 60%. Given the constellation of these symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome.",Answer: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.,Y
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because she has not had her menstrual period yet. At birth, she was found to have partial labial fusion and clitoromegaly. The mother reports that during the pregnancy she had noticed abnormal hair growth on her chin. The girl has severe acne. Three years ago, she broke her wrist after a minor trauma. Last year, she sustained a spinal compression fracture after lifting a box during a move. She currently takes oral isotretinoin and an oral contraceptive. The patient is at the 97th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows numerous inflamed pustules on her face and upper back. Breast development is at Tanner stage I. The patient refuses to have a pelvic examination. A pelvic ultrasound shows ovaries with multiple cysts and a normal uterus. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aromatase deficiency,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),N,Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),N,Polycystic ovary syndrome,N,Polycystic ovary syndrome,N,Polycystic ovary syndrome,N,,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is suggestive of an androgen excess state due to multiple signs and symptoms like delayed menarche (not had her menstrual period yet), severe acne, clitoromegaly (enlarged clitoris), and abnormal hair growth (hirsutism). Additionally, she also has recurrent fractures from minor trauma, indicating decreased bone mineral density, possibly due to hypercortisolism. The presence of multiple cysts on the ovaries can be a feature of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); however, PCOS wouldn't explain the entire clinical picture. The patient's mother also reported hirsutism during pregnancy. One diagnosis that could explain all of these findings is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is an autosomal recessive disorder that involves defective enzymes in the cortisol biosynthesis pathway. This leads to a decrease in cortisol and an increase in precursors, resulting in overproduction of androgens and adrenal hyperplasia. Most commonly, it is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.",Answer: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), androgen-secreting tumor, and Cushing's syndrome. The physical findings of clitoromegaly, severe acne, and multiple ovarian cysts suggest a hyperandrogenic condition.

Polycystic Ovary Syndrome typically presents with obesity, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities in a post-pubertal girl, but this patient has not yet reached puberty (Tanner stage I breast development).

Androgen-secreting tumors are typically associated with rapid onset virilization and are less likely in this case as the symptoms have been present from birth.

Cushing's syndrome can cause hirsutism and acne, but typically also presents with central obesity, striae, and easy bruising, which are not mentioned in the case.

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis and overproduction of adrenal androgens. The patient's history of clitoromegaly at birth and maternal hirsutism during pregnancy point towards exposure to excess androgens in utero, which is consistent with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.

Furthermore, the history of multiple fractures suggests decreased bone density, which can also occur in CAH due to excess adrenal androgens leading to high bone turnover.",Answer: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia,N,"Rationale: This patient's delay in the onset of menstruation (primary amenorrhea), presence of numerous ovarian cysts on ultrasound, and severe acne are indicative of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The clitoromegaly and abnormal hair growth (hirsutism) in this patient suggest an androgen excess, which is also consistent with PCOS. The fact that the mother also noticed abnormal hair growth on her chin during pregnancy suggests there might be a congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which can cause an overproduction of androgens and mimic symptoms of PCOS. However, the recurrent fractures after minor trauma raise the possibility of an underlying collagen disorder such as osteogenesis imperfecta, which can cause brittle bones, but this would not explain the patient's reproductive issues or abnormal androgenic features. Given the totality of findings, PCOS is the most likely diagnosis, potentially in conjunction with CAH.",Answer: Polycystic ovary syndrome,N,"Rationale: This patient's signs and symptoms include delayed puberty, partial labial fusion, clitoromegaly, severe acne, multiple cystic ovaries, and a history of fractures, which are indicative of hyperandrogenism and low bone mineral density. During pregnancy, the mother also experienced abnormal hair growth, suggesting exposure to excess androgens. These features are highly suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of autosomal recessive disorders characterized by impaired cortisol synthesis and subsequent overproduction of adrenal androgens. The most common form, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, can lead to salt-wasting crises in infancy and virilization. However, non-classic forms can present later with symptoms of androgen excess and without salt wasting, as seen in this patient. The fractures sustained from minor traumas are likely due to low bone mineral density, which is a common finding in CAH due to chronic glucocorticoid replacement therapy.",Answer: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) in a young woman with no menses, acne, and labial fusion is estimated at about 5%. The presence of cysts on ovaries, a typical finding in PCOS, increases the probability to about 20%. The presence of severe acne and history of abnormal hair growth in mother during pregnancy (indicative of high androgen levels) increase the probability to about 50%. Additionally, the patient's abnormal bone fractures suggest a possible endocrine disorder, which might further increase the probability to 70%. However, the absence of normal female development (Tanner stage I) and the presence of clitoromegaly might suggest a disorder of sexual differentiation, such as Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), which increases the probability for CAH to about 70%. Therefore, given the entire clinical picture, the most likely diagnosis is CAH.",Answer: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia,N
"A 3-year-old child is brought to the emergency department by his parents. The child presents with significant rapid breathing and appears unwell. On examination, his liver size is 1.5 times larger than children of his age, and he has mild pitting edema in his legs. This child is also in the lower weight-age and height-age percentiles. On auscultation, mild rales were noted and a fixed split S2 was heard on inspiration. There is no family history of congenital disorders or metabolic syndromes. What is the likely diagnosis?",Atrial septal defect,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,,"Rationale: This child has several signs and symptoms pointing to a heart issue. The significant rapid breathing, liver enlargement (hepatomegaly), mild pitting edema in his legs, and underweight condition could be associated with heart failure. The fixed split S2 on inspiration is particularly significant, as it's typically associated with an atrial septal defect (ASD). ASD is a type of congenital heart defect where there is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the top two chambers of the heart (atria). This hole allows oxygen-rich blood to leak into the oxygen-poor blood chambers in the heart, causing the symptoms that are observed.",Answer: Atrial Septal Defect,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this child's symptoms includes: congestive heart failure (CHF), liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and malnutrition.

Congestive heart failure (CHF): The child's symptoms of rapid breathing, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), pitting edema, and a fixed split S2 on auscultation are indicative of heart failure. The rales (crackles) on lung auscultation suggest fluid buildup, likely from left-sided heart failure. The failure of the heart leads to fluid buildup in the liver causing hepatomegaly, and in the systemic circulation causing edema. The fixed split S2 is typical of an atrial septal defect, a congenital heart defect, which could lead to heart failure if large and uncorrected.
Liver disease: Hepatomegaly can indicate liver disease, but liver diseases generally do not cause edema, fixed split S2 or rapid breathing.
Nephrotic syndrome: This condition can cause edema and growth failure, but not hepatomegaly or the fixed split S2.
Malnutrition: Malnutrition could account for his low weight and height percentiles, but would not typically cause hepatomegaly, edema, or a fixed split S2.
Based on the symptoms presented, the child most likely has congestive heart failure due to a congenital heart defect such as an atrial septal defect.",Answer: Congestive Heart Failure,N," Rationale: The key features of this child's presentation are rapid breathing (respiratory distress), an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly), pitting edema in his legs, low growth percentiles, rales on auscultation, and a fixed split S2 heard on inspiration. These findings provide clues to his likely diagnosis:

The child's respiratory distress and rales on auscultation are signs of lung disease, which could be due to a primary pulmonary condition or secondary to a cardiac condition.
The fixed split S2 is a hallmark of atrial septal defect (ASD), a type of congenital heart disease. In ASD, the left-to-right shunting of blood leads to increased flow through the right heart, causing delayed closure of the pulmonic valve and hence the fixed split S2.
The hepatomegaly and lower extremity edema are indicative of right heart failure, which can be secondary to a long-standing left-to-right shunt as in ASD.
Low growth percentiles could be due to chronic disease state, such as congenital heart disease, which can impact a child's nutritional status and growth.
Taking all these signs and symptoms into consideration, this child likely has an atrial septal defect that has led to heart failure.                 ",Answer: Atrial Septal Defect,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms, such as rapid breathing, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), pitting edema in the legs, lower weight and height percentiles, and a fixed split S2 on inspiration, point to a cardiovascular issue. The fixed split S2 is particularly indicative of an atrial septal defect (ASD). An ASD is a hole in the septum between the atria of the heart, which allows oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium to mix with oxygen-poor blood in the right atrium. This can lead to increased blood flow to the lungs, causing symptoms like rapid breathing and potentially leading to heart failure in children. The resulting heart failure can explain the hepatomegaly, as the liver becomes congested with blood that the heart is unable to efficiently pump out. This condition can also lead to growth problems and mild edema due to fluid overload.",Answer: Atrial septal defect,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability for pediatric heart failure in general population is very low, around 1%. However, this child has several symptoms which increases the likelihood of heart failure. Starting with rapid breathing and appearing unwell, this could increase the posterior probability of heart failure to 10%. The child's enlarged liver size is a sign of heart failure, raising the probability to 30%. The presence of edema further increases the probability to 40%. Poor growth (as indicated by the child being in the lower weight-age and height-age percentiles) could be due to chronic illness such as heart failure, which raises the probability to 60%. The presence of rales (a sign of fluid overload, often associated with heart failure) raises the probability to 80%. Finally, a fixed split S2 is a classic sign of atrial septal defect (ASD), a type of congenital heart disease that often leads to heart failure if left untreated, this increases the probability to over 90%. Given all these symptoms and signs, the child most likely has heart failure due to ASD.",Answer: Heart failure due to ASD.,Y
"A 72-year-old man is brought to the physician by his son because of gradually progressive yellow discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus for the past 2 weeks. During this period, his appetite has decreased and he has had a 6.3-kg (14-lb) weight loss. He reports that his stool appears pale and his urine is very dark. Three years ago, he had an episode of acute upper abdominal pain that was treated with IV fluids, NSAIDs, and dietary modification. He has stopped drinking alcohol since then; he used to drink 1–2 beers daily for 40 years. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows yellowing of the conjunctivae and skin. The abdomen is soft and nontender; a soft, cystic mass is palpated in the right upper quadrant. Serum studies show:
Bilirubin, total 5.6 mg/dL
Direct 4.8 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 192 U/L
AST 32 U/L
ALT 34 U/L
Abdominal ultrasonography shows an anechoic cystic mass in the subhepatic region and dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Pancreatic adenocarcinoma,Cholangiocarcinoma,Y,Biliary obstruction,N,Cholangiocarcinoma,Y,Biliary obstruction,N,Cholangiocarcinoma,Y,,"Rationale: The patient has symptoms of jaundice, pruritus, and dark urine, all of which are symptoms of cholestasis. The lab results show increased bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, further indicating cholestasis. The ultrasound results show a cystic mass in the subhepatic region and dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, suggesting biliary obstruction. A history of previous upper abdominal pain treated with fluids, NSAIDs, and diet changes may suggest a gallbladder issue. The most probable cause of his biliary obstruction given the findings, his age, the right upper quadrant mass, and weight loss is a cholangiocarcinoma, which is cancer of the bile ducts.",Answer: Cholangiocarcinoma.,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallstone disease, choledochal cysts, or pancreatic cancer. The patient has jaundice, pruritus, and pale stools, indicating cholestasis which is seen in all these conditions. The patient also reports weight loss which is often seen in malignancies.

However, his laboratory results show a predominantly direct hyperbilirubinemia and a raised alkaline phosphatase which indicate a post-hepatic cause of the jaundice, or obstructive jaundice. His AST and ALT levels are relatively normal which makes hepatocellular disease less likely.

The findings of an anechoic cystic mass in the subhepatic region on ultrasound and dilation of both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts also point towards an obstruction in the bile ducts. Given his history of long-term smoking and alcohol use which are risk factors, along with the weight loss and obstructive jaundice, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is pancreatic cancer",Answer: Pancreatic cancer.,Y,"Rationale: The clinical picture is indicative of obstructive jaundice, as evidenced by the progressive yellow discoloration of the skin, dark urine, pale stool, and the elevation of direct (conjugated) bilirubin. The gradual progression of symptoms and weight loss raises concern for a malignancy as the cause of the obstruction. His extensive history of smoking is a significant risk factor for multiple malignancies including pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer often presents with obstructive jaundice due to tumor involvement of the common bile duct or the pancreatic head itself, leading to compression and obstruction of the bile flow. The cystic mass in the subhepatic region could be related to the tumor itself or due to dilated gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) secondary to the obstruction of the common bile duct. The imaging findings of dilation of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are also consistent with obstruction at the level of the common bile duct or pancreatic head. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pancreatic cancer.",Answer: Pancreatic cancer.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of progressive jaundice, pruritus, dark urine, pale stools, and weight loss suggests obstructive jaundice due to biliary tract obstruction. The ultrasonography findings of dilation of both intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and an anechoic cystic mass in the subhepatic region are indicative of a blockage in the bile ducts. The high direct bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels corroborate biliary obstruction. A common cause of such symptoms and findings in this age group is a malignancy, such as pancreatic cancer. The pancreatic head is in close proximity to the common bile duct, and any growth in this region can compress the duct causing obstruction. Also, the long history of smoking in this patient significantly increases the risk of pancreatic cancer.",Answer: Pancreatic cancer,Y,"Rationale: We start with the prior probability for each possible disease that can cause jaundice, such as biliary stone disease, cancer, and liver disease. In this case, the patient's clinical presentation and tests are key to updating these probabilities.

The patient has jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), generalized pruritus, and weight loss. He also has a history of smoking and drinking. His symptoms indicate some form of obstructive jaundice. The primary causes of obstructive jaundice are stones, stricture, or malignancy in the biliary tract, liver diseases, or pancreatic diseases.

The bilirubin levels are elevated, especially the direct bilirubin, which indicates a post-hepatic cause (obstructive jaundice). The alkaline phosphatase level is also increased, which is often seen in conditions causing cholestasis (bile flow blockage).

The abdominal ultrasonography shows an anechoic cystic mass in the subhepatic region and dilation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. This makes a blockage in the biliary system more probable.

We have to consider the possibility of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer), especially given his age and history of smoking. However, a benign cause such as a choledochal cyst could also present in this way.

Considering all these factors, the probability of this patient having a malignant cause for his symptoms might start around 50%. His age and smoking history could increase this to around 70%, and the physical findings (especially the anechoic mass and dilated bile ducts) could increase the probability to around 90%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cholangiocarcinoma.",Answer: Cholangiocarcinoma,Y
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the physician because of stiffness and pain in multiple joints. She says that the fingers on both of her hands have become increasingly stiff and difficult to move over the past 8 months. She also complains of nails that break easily and look spotty as well as chronic back pain. She had a urinary tract infection a year ago that was treated with antibiotics. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Her vitals are within normal limits. A photograph of her right hand is shown. There are multiple, well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales over the shins and back. Serum studies show a negative rheumatoid factor and ANA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Psoriatic arthritis,Psoriasis,Y,Psoriasis,Y,Psoriasis,Y,Psoriatic Arthritis,Y,Psoriasis,Y,,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms suggest a systemic inflammatory disease. She has stiffness and pain in multiple joints, indicative of an arthritic condition. The symptoms of nails that break easily and look spotty, and the presence of well-demarcated red plaques with silvery-white scales over the shins and back, are consistent with psoriasis, a skin condition. However, this is not just skin psoriasis but is likely psoriatic arthritis, a specific type of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis. This diagnosis is further supported by the negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests, which rule out other types of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",Answer: Psoriatic Arthritis,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, and an infectious cause of arthritis such as gonorrhea. Given the stiffness in her fingers, along with the chronic back pain, and the appearance of her skin (red plaques with silvery-white scales), psoriatic arthritis is most likely. Psoriasis is a skin disease that is often associated with joint problems in a condition known as psoriatic arthritis. The presentation of nail changes (nails that break easily and look spotty) is also consistent with nail psoriasis which is commonly seen in patients with psoriatic arthritis. A negative rheumatoid factor and ANA further help rule out rheumatoid arthritis and lupus respectively, making psoriatic arthritis the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Psoriatic arthritis,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of chronic back pain, joint stiffness, easily breakable and spotted nails, and the presence of red plaques with silvery-white scales suggest a diagnosis of Psoriatic Arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a form of arthritis that affects some people who have psoriasis - a condition that features red patches of skin topped with silvery scales. Negative Rheumatoid factor and ANA further support the diagnosis as they rule out other forms of arthritis like Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus.",Answer: Psoriatic Arthritis,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with joint stiffness and pain, psoriasis-like skin changes, and nail changes, all of which are classic symptoms of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis often occurs in individuals with psoriasis but can also develop in people without skin psoriasis, particularly in those with relatives who have the disease. While this type of arthritis does affect the joints, it is also associated with a number of skin conditions, including plaques and scaling. Additionally, nail changes like pitting or separation from the nail bed are also common in people with this condition. The negative rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies (ANA) would help rule out conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.",Answer: Psoriatic arthritis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of psoriatic arthritis in the general population is about 1%. However, given the patient's complaints of stiffness and pain in multiple joints over a period of 8 months, the probability of psoriatic arthritis increases to about 15%. The addition of the characteristic skin findings - red plaques with silvery-white scales - raises the probability further to 50%. The detail that clinches the diagnosis is the mention of nail changes, which are common in psoriatic arthritis, raising the posterior probability to 80%. Even though the patient has a negative rheumatoid factor and ANA, which could potentially rule out other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, these tests are not always positive in psoriatic arthritis, so their negativity doesn't rule out the condition. The combination of these findings make psoriatic arthritis the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Psoriatic Arthritis,Y
A 70-year-old women presents to her primary care physician with sudden episodes of dizziness that resolve in certain positions. On further questioning she describes a false sense of motion with occasional spinning sensation consistent with vertigo. She denies any recent illnesses or hearing loss aside from presbycusis. Her vital signs are normal. During the physical exam the the patient reports an episode of vertigo after transitioning from sitting to supine and horizontal nystagmus is concurrently noted. What is the mostly likely diagnosis?,Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo  BPPV ,BPPV,Y,BPPV,Y,BPPV,Y,BPPV,Y,BPPV.,Y,,"This patient is experiencing episodes of vertigo that are positional in nature, suggesting a disturbance in the vestibular system of the inner ear. Specifically, the dizziness occurs when changing positions, such as going from sitting to supine. Furthermore, the physical exam shows horizontal nystagmus, an involuntary movement of the eyes that often accompanies vertigo. The absence of recent illnesses or hearing loss makes conditions like Meniere's disease or vestibular neuritis less likely. The combination of these findings strongly suggests benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), a condition where tiny calcium particles clump up in the inner ear, causing brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness.",Answer: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, vestibular neuritis, labyrinthitis, and central causes such as stroke or multiple sclerosis. The absence of hearing loss helps rule out Meniere's disease and labyrinthitis. Vestibular neuritis typically presents with constant vertigo rather than positional symptoms. The absence of other neurological signs makes central causes less likely. The patient's vertigo is provoked by changes in position and concurrent horizontal nystagmus was observed, which is characteristic of BPPV. Thus, the patient most likely has benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.",Answer: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,Y,"Rationale: This patient is experiencing positional vertigo and nystagmus, which suggests the dislodgement of otoliths within the inner ear, a condition known as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo. The symptoms, including a sense of motion or ""spinning,"" are often triggered by changes in head position, such as lying down or turning over.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y,"Rationale: This 70-year-old woman is experiencing episodes of dizziness that she describes as a spinning sensation and is associated with positional changes. Additionally, horizontal nystagmus was observed during the positional change in the physical exam. This clinical presentation is characteristic of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by the displacement of otoconia (tiny calcium particles) in the inner ear. The otoconia disrupt the normal fluid movement that the inner ear uses to sense head motion, leading to a false sense of spinning motion. BPPV is common among older adults and is characterized by brief episodes of mild to intense dizziness associated with changes in the position of the head. It is particularly noticed when moving from sitting to lying down or turning over in bed. The hallmark of BPPV is positional, episodic vertigo associated with nystagmus.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) in an elderly patient presenting with episodes of dizziness and vertigo might be around 20%. The fact that she denies any recent illness makes other causes like vestibular neuronitis less likely, which increases the posterior probability of BPPV to about 30%. The absence of hearing loss makes M�ni�re's disease less likely, again raising the likelihood of BPPV to 40%. The patient's report of vertigo being triggered by changes in position is classic for BPPV and would further increase the probability to around 70%. Finally, the observation of horizontal nystagmus during an episode which is consistent with BPPV increases the probability to about 90%. Given these observations and the Bayesian inference, this patient most likely has Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV).",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y
A 51-year-old woman comes to the physician because of daytime sleepiness and dry mouth for one month. She says her sleepiness is due to getting up to urinate several times each night. She noticed increased thirst about a month ago and now drinks up to 20 cups of water daily. She does not feel a sudden urge prior to urinating and has not had dysuria. She has a history of multiple urinary tract infections and head trauma following a suicide attempt 3 months ago. She has bipolar I disorder and hypertension. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 25 years. Examination shows poor skin turgor. Mucous membranes are dry. Expiratory wheezes are heard over both lung fields. There is no suprapubic tenderness. She describes her mood as “good” and her affect is appropriate. Neurologic examination shows tremor in both hands. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 151 mEq/L and an elevated antidiuretic hormone. Urine osmolality is 124 mOsm/kg H2O. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?,Mood stabilizer intake,SIADH,N,SIADH,N,Diabetes insipidus,Y,Diabetes insipidus,Y,SIADH,N,,"Rationale: This 51-year-old woman is experiencing daytime sleepiness and dry mouth, symptoms which she attributes to nocturia (getting up to urinate several times during the night). She has also noticed an increase in thirst, consuming large quantities of water daily. Physical examination shows poor skin turgor and dry mucous membranes, indicating dehydration. Her laboratory studies reveal a high serum sodium level (indicating hypernatremia), and low urine osmolality (indicating dilute urine), along with an elevated antidiuretic hormone. These findings suggest that her kidneys are not properly responding to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive urination and an inability to concentrate urine. She also has a history of head trauma. A condition called Central Diabetes Insipidus (CDI) could be the underlying cause. CDI is characterized by a deficiency of ADH due to damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, which can result from head trauma. The deficiency in ADH prevents the kidneys from concentrating urine, leading to polyuria (excessive urination) and polydipsia (excessive thirst). In this patient, the elevated ADH is likely an inappropriate response to dehydration and hypernatremia, rather than a reflection of normal pituitary function.",Answer: Central Diabetes Insipidus,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes diabetes insipidus, psychogenic polydipsia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. We can start by analyzing her symptoms and laboratory findings:

She has excessive thirst and excessive urination, which could be indicative of diabetes insipidus or diabetes mellitus. However, she has an elevated serum sodium (hypernatremia), and her urine osmolality is low, which suggests that her kidneys are not concentrating urine properly.

The elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels would initially suggest syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), but SIADH generally leads to hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.

Diabetes mellitus typically presents with polyuria, polydipsia, and hyperglycemia but not necessarily with a low urine osmolality and hypernatremia as seen in this case.

Psychogenic polydipsia can cause polyuria and polydipsia, but it generally doesn't lead to hypernatremia as the kidneys can generally handle the excessive fluid intake.

Given the history of head trauma, it's likely that there was damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary, leading to an inability to properly produce or release ADH despite its elevation. This leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, where the kidneys don't respond to ADH properly, leading to excessive urine production that is not concentrated (low urine osmolality) and excessive thirst.

In conclusion, the patient's history of head trauma, combined with her symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia, hypernatremia, and low urine osmolality despite elevated ADH levels, is most consistent with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",Answer: Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms of daytime sleepiness, dry mouth, increased thirst, and frequent nighttime urination. She also has an elevated serum sodium level, indicating hypernatremia. The finding of an elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH) coupled with low urine osmolality and hypernatremia is indicative of diabetes insipidus, specifically nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidneys do not respond properly to ADH, leading to excessive urination and, in turn, excessive thirst as the body tries to compensate for the fluid loss. The history of lithium treatment for bipolar disorder is crucial because lithium is known to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus by interfering with the kidney's response to ADH.",Answer: Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms of polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (excessive thirst), and daytime sleepiness due to nocturia (waking up at night to urinate). Additionally, she has a history of head trauma, and the laboratory studies show elevated serum sodium and an elevated antidiuretic hormone (ADH), indicating hypernatremia. The low urine osmolality in the context of high serum sodium levels suggests that her kidneys are not appropriately concentrating urine. This points to diabetes insipidus, which can be caused by the lack of production of ADH from the posterior pituitary (central diabetes insipidus) or by the kidneys not responding to ADH (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). Given her history of head trauma, it is likely that the trauma caused damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk, leading to inadequate secretion of ADH, and therefore, central diabetes insipidus. The dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor further support that she is dehydrated from excessive urine output, which is consistent with diabetes insipidus.",Answer: Central diabetes insipidus,N,"Rationale: We start by examining the details of the case. The patient is a 51-year-old woman who is experiencing excessive thirst, frequent urination, daytime sleepiness, and dry mouth. These symptoms are characteristic of diabetes insipidus, but we must examine the information step by step.

The prior probability of diabetes insipidus is low, let's say 2%.
The patient is experiencing polydipsia (excessive thirst) and polyuria (excessive urination), which increases the probability of diabetes insipidus to 15%.
She does not have a sudden urge to urinate nor dysuria, which are characteristic of a urinary tract infection, so the probability of diabetes insipidus goes up to 25%.
She has a history of head trauma three months ago, which could potentially affect the hypothalamus or pituitary gland, leading to diabetes insipidus. This increases the probability of diabetes insipidus to 45%.
Her serum sodium is elevated at 151 mEq/L, which is indicative of hypernatremia often associated with diabetes insipidus, increasing the probability to 60%.
She has elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is inconsistent with central diabetes insipidus but consistent with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus where the kidneys do not respond to ADH. This further increases the probability of diabetes insipidus to 80%.
Lastly, her urine osmolality is low at 124 mOsm/kg H2O, which is indicative of dilute urine, another feature of diabetes insipidus. This pushes the probability even higher, say 90%.
Based on the Bayesian inference, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is diabetes insipidus.",Answer: Diabetes insipidus,Y
"A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a chief complaint of ""failing health."" He states that he typically can converse with animals via telepathy, but is having trouble right now due to the weather. He has begun taking an assortment of Peruvian herbs to little avail. Otherwise he is not currently taking any medications. The patient lives alone and works in a health food store. He states that his symptoms have persisted for the past eight months. On physical exam, you note a healthy young man who is dressed in an all burlap ensemble. When you are obtaining the patient's medical history there are several times he is attempting to telepathically connect with the animals in the vicinity. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Schizotypal personality disorder,Schizophrenia,N,Schizophrenia,N,Schizophrenia,N,Schizophrenia,N,Schizophrenia,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 25-year-old man who believes that he can typically converse with animals through telepathy and is wearing unconventional attire. His belief in having telepathic abilities that are not grounded in reality, and his dedication to trying to use these perceived abilities during the medical consultation, suggest a detachment from reality which is characteristic of a psychiatric disorder. The persistence of symptoms for eight months rules out brief psychotic disorder. The fact that there is no mention of mood symptoms makes schizoaffective disorder less likely. There is also no mention of cognitive impairment that might suggest a medical etiology. Schizophrenia is characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and/or disorganized or catatonic behavior, with symptoms persisting for at least six months. This patient's strong belief in his ability to communicate with animals telepathically and his behavior are in line with the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia.",Answer: Schizophrenia,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this 25-year-old man includes schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, major depression with psychotic features, substance-induced psychosis, or a personality disorder. His belief in telepathy with animals and taking Peruvian herbs for this 'failing ability' are suggestive of delusions, which is an altered perception of reality. There is no indication of mood disorder symptoms, which makes major depression with psychotic features or bipolar disorder with psychotic features less likely. There is no information suggesting a substance use which makes substance-induced psychosis less likely. He has been having symptoms for the past eight months, which is longer than the required duration for schizophrenia diagnosis (6 months). Additionally, there is no evidence of affective symptoms, which makes schizoaffective disorder less likely. Furthermore, he is functional as evidenced by holding a job, which makes delusional disorder less likely. Based on his fixed false belief and duration of symptoms, schizophrenia is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Schizophrenia,N,"Rationale: This 25-year-old man presents with a belief that he can converse with animals via telepathy, and he is attempting to connect with animals telepathically during the medical history intake. These symptoms suggest the presence of delusions, which are fixed false beliefs that are not in keeping with the patient�s cultural background. His behavior of dressing in an all burlap ensemble and taking an assortment of Peruvian herbs for his issue also suggest eccentric behavior and unusual beliefs. When symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, or grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior are present, it is important to consider a psychotic disorder. Given that these symptoms have been persistent for eight months and there is no mention of mood symptoms, it is most consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is characterized by a chronic course of psychosis and functional impairment, and the symptoms must be present for at least six months for a definitive diagnosis.",Answer: Schizophrenia,N,"Rationale: This 25-year-old man presents with the belief that he can communicate with animals via telepathy and has been taking an assortment of herbs to improve his perceived failing abilities. These beliefs and behaviors are not consistent with cultural norms and suggest a detachment from reality. His symptoms have persisted for more than six months and he is functioning in society (working in a health food store) which makes schizophrenia less likely. The nature of his delusions and his ability to function despite them suggests a delusional disorder. Specifically, this could be classified as a grandiose subtype, where the individual has an over-inflated sense of worth, power, knowledge, or identity, as he believes he has the special ability to communicate with animals.",Answer: Delusional Disorder,N,"Rationale: Initially, the prior probability that the patient has a psychiatric condition is high given his claim of conversing with animals via telepathy. Let�s assign an arbitrary prior probability of 50% for any psychiatric condition. The fact that he believes the weather is affecting his telepathic abilities suggests delusional thinking, which increases the probability of a psychiatric condition, let's say to 70%. The use of alternative treatments like Peruvian herbs without any known medical indication, and his attire of an all-burlap ensemble, suggest unusual and possibly disorganized behavior, increasing the probability further to 85%. The attempts to telepathically connect with animals during the medical visit, despite the social context, suggest a lack of insight, which is also indicative of a psychiatric condition, possibly raising the probability to around 95%. Taken together, these symptoms are most consistent with a psychotic disorder, and among psychotic disorders, schizophrenia is a common diagnosis, especially in a young adult.",Answer: Schizophrenia,N
"A 28-year-old primigravid woman is brought to the emergency department after complaining of severe abdominal pain for 3 hours. She has had no prenatal care. There is no leakage of amniotic fluid. Since arrival, she has had 5 contractions in 10 minutes, each lasting 70 to 90 seconds. Pelvic examination shows a closed cervix and a uterus consistent in size with a 38-week gestation. Ultrasound shows a single live intrauterine fetus in a breech presentation consistent with a gestational age of approximately 37 weeks. The amniotic fluid index is 26 and the fetal heart rate is 92/min. The placenta is not detached. She is scheduled for an emergency lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate. The infant is delivered and APGAR score is noted to be 8 at 1 minute. The doctor soon notices cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, which does not resolve when the infant cries. The infant is foaming at the mouth and drooling. He also has an intractable cough. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Esophageal atresia,Meconium Aspiration Syndrome,N,Meconium aspiration syndrome,N,Meconium aspiration syndrome,N,Meconium aspiration syndrome,N,Meconium Aspiration Syndrome,N,,"Rationale: This infant was just delivered via emergency C-section and exhibits signs of cyanosis, foaming at the mouth, drooling, and an intractable cough. Cyanosis indicates a lack of oxygen. The presence of foaming at the mouth and drooling may suggest difficulty handling secretions. One of the most common causes of these symptoms in a newborn is tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) with or without esophageal atresia. In TEF, there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. The intractable cough and difficulty handling secretions are due to the abnormal passage of fluids into the trachea, which can also lead to aspiration and difficulty in oxygenation, hence the cyanosis.",Answer: Tracheoesophageal fistula,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for the infant's symptoms includes: neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital heart disease, tracheoesophageal fistula, and choanal atresia. However, the cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, intractable cough, foaming at the mouth, and drooling are highly suggestive of a tracheoesophageal fistula. This condition is a congenital anomaly where there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. In this case, the infant�s symptoms indicate that he is unable to effectively clear secretions from his airway and that these secretions are possibly coming from the esophagus via a fistula, causing his respiratory distress and cyanosis.",Answer: Tracheoesophageal fistula,N,"Rationale: This newborn presented with cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, foaming at the mouth, drooling, and an intractable cough immediately after delivery. These symptoms strongly suggest an inability to manage secretions and potential airway obstruction. The most likely diagnosis in a neonate with these symptoms is tracheoesophageal fistula, which is a congenital abnormality where there is a connection between the trachea and esophagus. This can lead to aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs and difficulty clearing secretions, which explains the symptoms seen in the infant.",Answer: Tracheoesophageal fistula,N,"Rationale: The infant's symptoms of cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa, foaming at the mouth, drooling, and intractable cough are suggestive of a congenital malformation of the trachea and esophagus. The most common form of such malformation is tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) with or without esophageal atresia. In cases of TEF, there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. The symptoms in this scenario are consistent with TEF, especially the frothy bubbles in the mouth and drooling which are due to the saliva entering the trachea and lungs through the fistula. Additionally, the cyanosis could be attributed to the aspiration of saliva into the lungs, leading to difficulty in oxygenating the blood. Since these symptoms are observed immediately after birth, a congenital abnormality like tracheoesophageal fistula is highly likely.",Answer: Tracheoesophageal fistula,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of the infant having esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula is relatively low in the general population. However, we need to take into account the specific symptoms observed:

Cyanosis of the lips and oral mucosa: This might indicate an issue with the airway or breathing, but is not specific to esophageal atresia. The probability increases marginally.

Foaming at the mouth and drooling: These symptoms indicate that the saliva is not being swallowed properly which is characteristic of esophageal atresia. This significantly increases the probability of esophageal atresia.

Intractable cough: This could also be an indicator of esophageal atresia especially if there is a tracheoesophageal fistula as it means that there could be fluid entering the trachea. This again increases the probability.

Cyanosis not resolving even when the infant cries: This indicates that the issue is not with the oxygenation of the blood but rather with the anatomy of the esophagus and trachea, further increasing the probability of esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula.

Based on these symptoms, and how they sequentially increase the likelihood, the most probable diagnosis is esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula.",Answer: Esophageal atresia,Y
"Three days after undergoing an open cholecystectomy, a 73-year-old man has fever and abdominal pain. He has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 1 year ago. He does not drink alcohol. Prior to admission to the hospital, his medications included lisinopril, metformin, ipratropium, and tamsulosin. He appears acutely ill and lethargic. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/84 mm Hg. He is oriented only to person. Examination shows a 10-cm subcostal incision that appears dry and non-erythematous. Scattered expiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. His abdomen is distended with tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dl
Leukocyte count 19,000/mm3
Serum
Glucose 180 mg/dl
Urea Nitrogen 25 mg/dl
Creatinine 1.2 g/dl
Lactic acid 2.5 mEq/L (N = 0.5 - 2.2 mEq/L)

Protein 1+
RBC 1–2/hpf
WBC 32–38/hpf
What is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's current condition?""",Bladder outlet obstruction,Sepsis.,N,Sepsis,N,Post-operative infection,N,Sepsis,N,Sepsis,N,,"Rationale: This patient underwent an open cholecystectomy three days ago and is now presenting with fever, abdominal pain, and lethargy. His lab results indicate leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and an elevated lactic acid, both signs of infection and possibly sepsis. His elevated temperature of 39.5�C further supports the possibility of an infection. Given the timeline after surgery and the signs of infection, it's highly likely that this patient has developed a postoperative intra-abdominal infection, possibly due to a leakage or contamination during surgery.",Answer: Intra-abdominal infection,N,"Rationale: In the presented case, the 73-year-old male has undergone an open cholecystectomy and developed fever and abdominal pain three days post-surgery. He has an elevated temperature and an elevated leukocyte count, indicating an infection. The differentials that should be considered include wound infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and intra-abdominal infection.The surgical incision is described as dry and non-erythematous, which makes wound infection unlikely. His history of COPD and smoking could point towards pneumonia, but the physical exam only shows expiratory wheezing, not localized crackles or consolidation signs.The patient's history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and the presence of a high white blood cell count in the urine (32-38 WBCs per high-power field) is highly suggestive of a urinary tract infection. The urine WBCs are significantly elevated, which is a strong indicator of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It�s also crucial to note that this patient is at an increased risk for UTI given his history of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which can cause urinary retention and subsequent infection.

The patient also has abdominal tenderness and distention, which raises concern for intra-abdominal infection, but the urine findings point more towards a urinary tract infection as the source of sepsis.

In conclusion, the patient's elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and pyuria are most consistent with a urinary tract infection that has led to sepsis, given his altered mental status, tachycardia, and fever.",Answer: Urinary tract infection,Y,"Rationale: This 73-year-old patient has undergone an open cholecystectomy and three days later, he has developed a fever, abdominal pain, and is lethargic. His laboratory studies show leukocytosis (Leukocyte count 19,000/mm3), which is indicative of an infection. He also has elevated lactic acid levels (Lactic acid 2.5 mEq/L, N = 0.5 - 2.2 mEq/L), which could be indicative of tissue hypoperfusion and sepsis. The patient's history of smoking, COPD, and recent surgery places him at a high risk for postoperative infections. The distended abdomen with tenderness in the lower quadrants suggests there might be an intra-abdominal source of infection. Given the clinical scenario and lab values, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's current condition is a bacterial infection that has led to sepsis, resulting from the body�s response to the infection, which could cause tissue hypoperfusion (as evidenced by elevated lactic acid).",Answer: Sepsis due to infection,N,"Rationale: This 73-year-old man has recently undergone open cholecystectomy and is now presenting with fever, lethargy, and abdominal pain. His vital signs indicate a fever and tachycardia, suggesting an infectious process. His laboratory findings show leukocytosis, which supports the presence of infection. Elevated lactic acid levels imply tissue hypoperfusion, possibly due to sepsis. The patient�s history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and smoking could have contributed to his compromised respiratory function, increasing his risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. However, the fact that he is acutely ill, febrile, and has abdominal pain and distension points towards an intra-abdominal source of infection. The recent surgery and the clinical picture suggest the possibility of an intra-abdominal abscess or peritonitis as a complication following the cholecystectomy. The elevated white blood cell count in urine might be due to concurrent infection or could be reflective of a systemic inflammatory response.",Answer: Intra-abdominal infection,N,"Rationale: We start with the prior probabilities for the common causes of fever and abdominal pain in a patient who underwent open cholecystectomy. The possible causes include infection, bile leakage, and postoperative ileus. We will use Bayesian inference to determine the probability of intra-abdominal infection, which is a common cause of the symptoms described in the scenario.

Prior probability of intra-abdominal infection post-cholecystectomy is about 10%.

The patient has fever (39.5�C or 103.1�F) which is a strong indicator of infection. This increases the posterior probability of intra-abdominal infection to about 40%.

The patient is acutely ill and lethargic and has a high leukocyte count (19,000/mm3), which is another indicator of infection. This further increases the probability to around 70%.

The patient has abdominal tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants, which is consistent with intra-abdominal infection. This further increases the probability to around 90%.

The elevated lactic acid (2.5 mEq/L) is an indicator of tissue hypoperfusion and can be associated with severe infection and sepsis. This corroborates the high probability of intra-abdominal infection.

Given the fever, leukocytosis, abdominal tenderness, and elevated lactic acid levels, the likelihood of intra-abdominal infection as the underlying mechanism of this patient's current condition is very high.",Answer: Intra-abdominal infection,N
"A 72-year-old man is brought in by his daughter who is concerned about his recent memory impairment. The patient’s daughter says she has noticed impairment in memory and functioning for the past month. She says that he has forgotten to pay bills and go shopping, and, as a result, the electricity was cut off due to non-payment. She also says that last week, he turned the stove on and forgot about it, resulting in a kitchen fire. The patient has lived by himself since his wife died last year. He fondly recalls living with his wife and how much he misses her. He admits that he feels ‘down’ most days of the week living on his own and doesn’t have much energy. When asked about the kitchen fire and problems with the electricity, he gets defensive and angry. At the patient’s last routine check-up 3 months ago, he was healthy with no medical problems. His vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient appears to have a flat affect. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Pseudodementia,Major depressive disorder,Y,Depression,Y,Depression,Y,Depression,Y,Depression,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is a 72-year-old man who has been showing signs of memory impairment and difficulty with daily functioning over the past month. Some of the problems that the patient is facing include forgetting to pay bills and leaving the stove on, which resulted in a kitchen fire. Additionally, the patient admits to feeling 'down' most days of the week and has low energy levels. He also shows emotional responses such as getting defensive and angry when questioned about recent events.

Given that these symptoms started after the death of his wife and he reports feeling 'down', it is important to consider depression as a potential cause. In older adults, depression can manifest with symptoms that mimic dementia, which is known as pseudodementia. In pseudodementia, the cognitive and functional impairments are a consequence of the underlying depressive mood disorder, rather than a degenerative process. The flat affect and the patient's admission to feeling down most days support this diagnosis. It is also worth noting that depression-related cognitive dysfunction is potentially reversible with appropriate treatment, in contrast to degenerative dementias.",Answer: Depression (Pseudodementia),Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes depression, Alzheimer's disease, another form of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or an adjustment disorder. Given the patient's recent bereavement, it is important to consider depression, especially since it can manifest with cognitive symptoms in older adults, known as pseudodementia. The symptoms of memory impairment have been noticed for the past month, which is relatively acute. Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia usually have a more insidious onset. The patient also exhibits a flat affect, admits to feeling down most days, and has low energy, which are indicative of depressive symptoms. His defensive and angry behavior could also be consistent with the irritability that can be seen in depression. Considering the recent loss of his wife, and the relatively acute onset of cognitive symptoms along with a depressive mood, this case most likely represents depression.",Answer: Depression,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of vertigo and nystagmus triggered by changes in the position of her head are consistent with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo and occurs when calcium carbonate crystals, normally found in the otolith organs of the inner ear, become dislodged and move into the semicircular canals. These displaced crystals can cause abnormal sensation of motion (vertigo) in response to changes in head position, as they disrupt the normal fluid movement within the semicircular canals that are essential for maintaining balance.",Answer: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,N,"Rationale: The symptoms of this patient, including memory loss, impaired functioning, and mood changes, suggest a psychiatric disorder. Considering his age and the fact that his wife died only a year ago, it is very plausible that he is experiencing a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), especially given his low mood, low energy, and flat affect. Depression in the elderly can present with cognitive impairment that can mimic a dementia syndrome, often referred to as pseudodementia. Unlike in true dementia, these cognitive impairments are potentially reversible. Further, his defensiveness when confronted about his forgetfulness is more consistent with depressive pseudodementia, as those with true dementia are often unaware of their cognitive deficits.",Answer: Depressive Pseudodementia,Y,"Rationale: Given the patient's symptoms, two possible diagnoses come to mind: dementia or depression.

Let's consider dementia first. The prior probability of dementia in this age group is around 10%. The symptoms of memory impairment and functional decline increase this to about 25%. However, the timeline of the symptoms seems to be relatively short (a month), which is less typical for dementia and reduces the posterior probability to about 20%.

Next, let's consider major depressive disorder, also known as depression. The prior probability of depression in the elderly population is about 10% as well. The presence of several core symptoms - feeling 'down', low energy, and flat affect - increases the probability to 40%. Defensive and angry behavior, potentially arising from perceived threats to autonomy, can be observed in cases of depression, increasing the probability further to about 50%. Finally, considering the social context - the recent death of his wife and now living alone - increases the likelihood of depression to about 70%.

This patient's memory impairment might actually be a result of 'pseudodementia', a syndrome seen in older adults in which they manifest symptoms similar to dementia but the cause is actually a major depressive disorder. Once the depression is treated, the cognitive impairment improves. This is different from most forms of dementia, which are typically irreversible.

Therefore, given the above Bayesian reasoning and the symptoms presented, major depressive disorder (with pseudodementia) is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",Answer: Major Depressive Disorder,Y
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for fatigue. The patient states that he has not been sleeping well and requests sleep medication to help him with his fatigue. He recently changed his diet to try to increase his energy and has been on a vegetarian diet for the past several months. The patient has no significant past medical history. He smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and drinks 5 alcoholic beverages per day. The patient has lost 12 pounds since his last visit 1 month ago. Physical exam demonstrates a tired man. He appears thin, and his skin and sclera are icteric. Abdominal ultrasound is notable for a thin-walled and enlarged gallbladder. A urine sample is collected and is noted to be amber in color. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pancreatic adenocarcinoma,Obstructive jaundice,N,Cholecystitis,N,Cholecystitis,N,Gallbladder disease,N,Gilbert Syndrome,N,,"Rationale: The patient presents with fatigue, recent weight loss, and icterus (yellowing of the skin and sclera), which are general signs of illness. However, the clue to his condition is the finding of a thin-walled and enlarged gallbladder on the ultrasound, coupled with the amber-colored urine. This combination of symptoms suggests obstructive jaundice, which may be due to a gallstone or, more likely given the rapid weight loss and the patient's history of heavy smoking and alcohol use, pancreatic cancer obstructing the common bile duct.",Answer: Pancreatic cancer,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes liver disease (such as alcoholic liver disease or cirrhosis), pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder cancer. The patient has a history of heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, both risk factors for liver disease and various cancers. The icteric skin and sclera suggest jaundice, which is often due to liver disease or a blockage in the bile ducts. The urinary finding of amber urine can also be a sign of jaundice. The presence of an enlarged, thin-walled gallbladder on ultrasound can be a sign of ""gallbladder hydrops,"" a condition where the gallbladder is filled with mucus or clear, watery fluid. However, in the context of obstructive jaundice, this could also represent Courvoisier's sign, which is often seen in the setting of a pancreatic head tumor blocking the bile ducts. This patient's recent weight loss, despite not intentionally trying to lose weight, is another worrisome symptom often seen in malignancies. Thus, while liver disease may certainly be present given the patient's history, the presence of Courvoisier's sign suggests a more ominous diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.",Answer: Pancreatic cancer.,Y,"Rationale: The patient's presentation of weight loss, fatigue, change in skin color to icteric (jaundiced), and the ultrasound finding of an enlarged gallbladder are suggestive of some form of liver disease or biliary obstruction. Additionally, the amber colored urine might suggest bilirubinuria which is a characteristic of liver disease, particularly if there's obstruction of the bile ducts. Given the patient's heavy alcohol consumption, the most probable diagnosis is alcoholic liver disease, which might have progressed to cirrhosis leading to bile duct obstruction and jaundice.",Answer: Alcoholic liver disease.,N,"Rationale: This patient's presentation is suggestive of malignancy, specifically pancreatic cancer. His risk factors include age (over 60), heavy alcohol use, smoking, and recent unexplained weight loss. His symptoms of fatigue and icterus (yellowing of the skin and sclera) indicate possible liver involvement or biliary obstruction, which is common in pancreatic cancer due to the anatomical proximity of the pancreas and biliary tract. Pancreatic cancer often presents with nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss, but can also cause obstructive jaundice if the tumor is located in the head of the pancreas and impinges on the biliary tract. The presence of a thin-walled, enlarged gallbladder on ultrasound could be Courvoisier's sign, indicative of obstruction of the common bile duct due to malignancy, and not gallstones, as gallstones would cause a thick-walled, shrunken gallbladder. The amber-colored urine suggests bilirubinuria, another sign of obstructive jaundice. Although the patient has changed his diet, the given signs and symptoms point more towards a pathological cause, such as pancreatic cancer, rather than a simple dietary deficiency.",Answer: Pancreatic Cancer,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of pancreatic cancer in the general population is low, about 1.6%. However, this patient has multiple risk factors that increase this probability. First, the patient is a heavy smoker, which increases the probability of pancreatic cancer to approximately 10%. Second, he consumes high amounts of alcohol daily, which further increases the probability to about 20%. The patient's recent significant weight loss, an often seen symptom of pancreatic cancer, raises the probability to 40%. Moreover, the presence of jaundice, as indicated by the icteric skin and sclera, and a thin-walled and enlarged gallbladder, known as Courvoisier sign, is highly suggestive of pancreatic cancer obstructing the bile duct. This increases the probability to approximately 75%. The dark urine suggests bilirubinuria, which is another common finding in pancreatic cancer patients with biliary obstruction, thus bringing the probability even higher to approximately 85%. Therefore, the patient most likely has pancreatic cancer.",Answer: Pancreatic Cancer,Y
"A four-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother for recurrent nosebleeds. The mother reports that the boy has had five nosebleeds within the past 2 weeks, each lasting between 15 and 20 minutes. The patient was born at term and has been hospitalized twice for pneumonia treatment. There is no family history of serious illness. The patient is at the 8th percentile for height and the 30th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a small, thin child with two flat, dark brown areas of hyperpigmentation across the upper back and a similar discoloration on the left buttock. There is bilateral esotropia. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.3 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 107 μm3, leukocyte count of 3,800/mm3, and platelet count of 46,000/mm3. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",Defect in DNA crosslink repair,Fanconi Anemia,Y,Fanconi Anemia,Y,Glanzmann thrombasthenia,N,Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia,N,Sickle Cell Anemia,N,,"Rationale: This child has several clinical features pointing towards a particular diagnosis. He presents with recurrent nosebleeds and has been previously hospitalized for pneumonia, indicating a propensity for bleeding and infection. He's also below average for height and has hyperpigmented skin lesions. The laboratory findings reveal macrocytic anemia (evidenced by a mean corpuscular volume of 107 fL, which is above the usual range), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), collectively indicating a problem with bone marrow and the production of blood cells. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Fanconi anemia, a rare, inherited disease that leads to bone marrow failure.",Answer: Fanconi anemia,Y,"The differential for this child includes coagulopathies such as Von Willebrand disease or hemophilia, aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and leukemia. Considering his recurrent nosebleeds and low platelet count, a coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia is likely. However, he also has a low hemoglobin concentration and leukocyte count, which would be more suggestive of a bone marrow failure syndrome like aplastic anemia or Fanconi anemia. His birth at term and lack of family history of serious illness make congenital bone marrow failure syndromes slightly less likely, but not impossible. The presence of skin hyperpigmentation, low stature, and bilateral esotropia (eye misalignment) are more specific findings that suggest Fanconi anemia, a rare, inherited bone marrow failure syndrome that can lead to aplastic anemia. Patients with Fanconi anemia often have physical abnormalities, including short stature, skin hyperpigmentation, and eye abnormalities, in addition to bone marrow failure manifesting as pancytopenia (low counts of all three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Given the combination of symptoms and lab findings in this child, Fanconi anemia is the most likely underlying cause.",Answer: Fanconi anemia,Y,"Rationale: This child presents with multiple recurrent nosebleeds, history of pneumonia, and notably low measurements for height and weight, indicating possible growth delay. On examination, the child has hyperpigmented skin lesions and esotropia (eye misalignment). Laboratory results indicate macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume >100 fL), leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. This constellation of findings is characteristic of Fanconi anemia, a rare, inherited DNA-repair disorder leading to bone marrow failure. In addition to aplastic anemia, Fanconi anemia is associated with various congenital malformations (including short stature), skin pigmentation changes, increased risk of malignancies, and a propensity for developing infections due to low white blood cell count.",Answer: Fanconi anemia,Y,"Rationale: This young boy is presenting with recurrent nosebleeds, two flat dark brown areas of hyperpigmentation, bilateral esotropia, and anemia with macrocytosis (high MCV), as well as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The combination of these findings suggests a diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, a genetic condition caused by defective DNA repair mechanisms. It is often associated with characteristic physical abnormalities (e.g., skin hyperpigmentation, small stature, eye anomalies), progressive bone marrow failure (which leads to macrocytic anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and hence the recurrent nosebleeds due to low platelets), and predisposition to malignancy.
",Answer: Fanconi anemia,Y,"Rationale: This case illustrates a child with a few notable findings: recurrent nosebleeds, low height percentile, hyperpigmented spots, bilateral esotropia (crossed eyes), and pancytopenia (reduced counts of all types of blood cells).

Starting with the prior probability, the initial symptoms suggest a bleeding disorder (for example, due to the recurrent nosebleeds), which in children can be as high as 10%. However, when taking into account other symptoms and signs, the posterior probability will change.

Hyperpigmented spots or caf�-au-lait spots are indicative of a genetic disorder, which, combined with recurrent nosebleeds and pancytopenia, raises the posterior probability for Fanconi Anemia to about 30%.The presence of bilateral esotropia in combination with the previous findings further increases the probability of Fanconi Anemia to around 50%.

The presence of pancytopenia, especially in conjunction with these other findings, can raise the probability of Fanconi Anemia to approximately 70%.

Given the constellation of findings including recurrent nosebleeds, growth delay, hyperpigmented spots, esotropia, and pancytopenia, the most likely diagnosis is Fanconi Anemia, a rare genetic disorder leading to bone marrow failure.",Answer: Fanconi Anemia,Y
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his roommates for aggressive and unusual behavior. His roommates state that he has been under a lot of stress lately from his final exams and has been more reclusive. They state that this evening he was very irritable and was yelling at his computer prior to breaking it, followed by him spending several hours at the gym. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 137/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an irritable young man. Cardiopulmonary exam is notable for tachycardia and bilateral clear breath sounds. Neurological exam reveals dilated pupils. The patient is notably diaphoretic and speaks very rapidly during the physical exam and is aggressive. He is given haloperidol, diphenhydramine, and diazepam for sedation and placed in soft restraints. His symptoms resolved over the next 10 hours in the emergency department. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lisdexamfetamine intoxication,Stimulant intoxication,Y,Manic episode,N,Manic episode,N,Serotonin Syndrome,N,Excited delirium,N,,"Rationale: The 24-year-old man is displaying signs of aggressive and erratic behavior, which is out of character according to his roommates. These behaviors, coupled with his physical symptoms such as tachycardia, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and rapid speech, suggest that he could be under the influence of a stimulant. This patient's symptoms and the context of his situation suggest a substance-induced episode, possibly related to the stress of his final exams. Drugs such as amphetamines, cocaine, or other sympathomimetics can cause these symptoms. In this case, given the resolution of symptoms after being sedated and the absence of any other overt pathology to explain his behavior, a stimulant-induced psychotic disorder is the most likely diagnosis",Answer: Stimulant-induced psychotic disorder.,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hyperthyroidism, drug intoxication (e.g. amphetamines, cocaine, or other stimulants), psychosis, manic episode, or serotonin syndrome. Hyperthyroidism could present with irritability, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, but this condition does not typically result in pupil dilation or aggressive behavior. Psychosis or a manic episode could present with irritability and aggression, but would not usually result in elevated temperature or tachycardia. Serotonin syndrome could result in elevated temperature, tachycardia, diaphoresis, dilated pupils, and increased reflexes, but this condition usually occurs with serotonergic medications or drugs of abuse such as MDMA, which the patient's history does not suggest. In contrast, the symptoms of drug intoxication with a stimulant like cocaine or amphetamines, including aggression, irritability, elevated vital signs, diaphoresis, and dilated pupils, match this patient's presentation. Moreover, these symptoms resolved after sedation, which also supports this diagnosis.",Answer: Drug intoxication,N,"Rationale: This patient is exhibiting symptoms of hyperactivity, aggression, diaphoresis, tachycardia, and dilated pupils, which are consistent with stimulant intoxication. These symptoms could arise from the use of various substances, including amphetamines or cocaine. The rapid resolution of symptoms after administration of sedatives and being in a controlled environment further supports this diagnosis.",Answer: Stimulant Intoxication,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of irritability, aggression, diaphoresis, mydriasis (dilated pupils), tachycardia, elevated temperature, and hypertension could be consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, a clinical syndrome often associated with drug use that increases sympathetic nervous system activity. Common agents include cocaine, amphetamines, and synthetic cathinones (""bath salts""). This patient's unusual behavior, extreme agitation, and extreme physical activity (spending hours at the gym) are suggestive of a stimulant use disorder. The resolution of his symptoms after administration of sedative medications and time supports the diagnosis of an acute intoxication event.",Answer: Stimulant Intoxication,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of stimulant abuse, such as methamphetamine or cocaine, in a young, otherwise healthy individual exhibiting aggressive and unusual behavior is relatively high, say 20%. However, as we add in more data, the probability will change. The patient's hyperthermia (temperature of 101F) and tachycardia (pulse of 120/min) could be associated with several conditions, but in this context, they increase the posterior probability of stimulant abuse to about 40%. The patient's dilated pupils, known as mydriasis, which are often associated with stimulant use, increase the posterior probability further to about 60%. Diaphoresis (excessive sweating) and rapid speech, in the absence of a fever or infection, suggest a hyperadrenergic state that further increases the probability to around 80%. Finally, the rapid resolution of symptoms after sedation and supportive care in the emergency department strongly suggests intoxication with a short-acting substance such as a stimulant, pushing the final posterior probability up to approximately 95%.",Answer: Stimulant abuse,Y
"A 17-year-old girl presents to the gynecologist's office due to lack of menarche. She has been sexually active with 1 male lifetime partner and always uses a condom. Her mother believes that breast development started at 11 years old. On exam, she is a well-appearing, non-hirsute teenager with Tanner V breast and pubic hair development. Her pelvic exam reveals normal external genitalia, a shortened vagina, and the cervix is unable to be visualized. Initial laboratory testing for hormone levels and karyotype is normal, and imaging confirms what you suspect on exam. What is the most likely cause of her lack of menstruation?",M llerian agenesis,Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser Syndrome,Y,MRKH Syndrome,Y,MRKH Syndrome,Y,Imperforate hymen.,N,MRKH Syndrome,Y,,"Rationale: The patient in question is a 17-year-old girl who has not yet had her first period, which is termed primary amenorrhea. Normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner V breast and pubic hair development) imply normal estrogen levels, which indicates functioning ovaries. Her examination reveals normal external genitalia and a shortened vagina, but the cervix could not be visualized. A normal hormone panel and karyotype are also significant findings. These findings point towards a congenital anomaly of the mullerian ducts, likely Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper part (2/3) of the vagina in women showing normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and a normal 46,XX karyotype.",Answer: Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser Syndrome,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes primary amenorrhea due to Turner syndrome, androgen insensitivity syndrome, or M�llerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome). Turner syndrome can be ruled out due to normal breast development and a normal karyotype. Androgen insensitivity syndrome can be ruled out due to the lack of hirsutism. This leaves us with M�llerian agenesis, which fits with her normal external genitalia, shortened vagina, and absence of the cervix. Further, her normal hormonal profile fits M�llerian agenesis because ovaries (the site of hormone production) are typically unaffected in this condition. Therefore, this patient most likely has M�llerian agenesis as the cause of her primary amenorrhea.",Answer: M�llerian agenesis,Y,"Rationale: This 17-year-old patient presents with primary amenorrhea, normal development of secondary sexual characteristics, a normal hormone profile, and normal karyotype. The crucial finding in this case is the shortened vagina with no identifiable cervix on physical examination. This is indicative of Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a congenital malformation characterized by aplasia or hypoplasia of the uterus and upper part of the vagina, despite normal ovarian function and karyotype (46,XX). MRKH syndrome is the most common cause of vaginal agenesis, leading to primary amenorrhea in young women with normal development of secondary sexual characteristics.",Answer: Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser syndrome,N,"Rationale: This patient's lack of menarche (absence of menstruation), normal secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner V breast and pubic hair development), normal hormone levels and karyotype, together with a blind-ending vagina and non-visible cervix on examination, strongly suggest Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. MRKH is characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus and upper part of the vagina in women showing normal development of secondary sexual characteristics and a normal 46,XX karyotype. Despite having ovaries and therefore normal endocrine function (hence the normal secondary sexual characteristics and hormone levels), these women do not have a menstrual cycle due to the absence of the uterus.",Answer: Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser syndrome.,N,"Rationale: The initial (prior) probability of this teenager having Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by the underdevelopment or absence of the vagina and uterus, is low given the rarity of the condition (~1 in 4500 females). However, several specific features from her case significantly increase the posterior probability:

Lack of menarche despite normal secondary sexual characteristics such as Tanner V breast and pubic hair development: The absence of menstruation in a physically mature teenager suggests an issue with the reproductive tract itself, potentially increasing the probability of MRKH to about 10%.

The patient's history of normal hormone levels and karyotype: These findings would rule out conditions like Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and Turner's Syndrome, further increasing the probability of MRKH to around 30%.

Examination findings of a shortened vagina and absence of a visible cervix: These are very specific findings for MRKH, and would significantly increase the posterior probability to above 70%.

Confirmation by imaging, presumably showing underdevelopment or absence of the uterus and upper vagina: This would raise the posterior probability of MRKH to near 100%.

Based on this Bayesian inference, the most likely cause of this patient's lack of menstruation is MRKH syndrome.",Answer: Mayer-Rokitansky-K�ster-Hauser Syndrome,N
"A 17-year-old girl comes to the emergency department with a 5-day history of severe abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. She also has pain with urination. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She experienced a burning pain when she last had sexual intercourse 3 days ago. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness in the lower quadrants. Pelvic examination shows cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge.

Additionally, she has been using condoms inconsistently, indicating potential exposure to sexually transmitted infections. The presence of cervical motion tenderness, purulent cervical discharge, a high leukocyte count, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate further support an infection. All these symptoms and signs are consistent with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which is usually caused by a sexually transmitted infection spreading from the vagina to the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries.",Answer: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), urinary tract infection (UTI), ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis, and gastroenteritis. The patient�s symptoms of abdominal pain, pain with urination, and burning during intercourse could initially point towards a UTI. However, she also has a purulent cervical discharge and cervical motion tenderness, which are indicative of PID. The elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate support an inflammatory process, which is consistent with PID. PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, often due to sexually transmitted infections, and is more probable in sexually active young women, especially when contraception is not used consistently, as in this case.",Answer: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,Y,"Rationale: This 17-year-old girl presents with a 5-day history of severe abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting, pain during urination, and a burning sensation during intercourse. She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Her physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, and purulent cervical discharge. She is also febrile and has an elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, indicating infection and inflammation. These symptoms and findings are characteristic of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by sexually transmitted infections like Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. PID can cause inflammation and infection in the female upper genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.",Answer: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,Y,"Rationale: The 17-year-old girl in question has a history of severe abdominal pain, cramping, nausea, and vomiting. She is sexually active with inconsistent condom use, and experienced pain during her last sexual intercourse. On physical examination, she has lower abdominal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness and purulent cervical discharge, which are characteristic features of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is typically caused by the spread of a bacterial infection, often sexually transmitted, to the uterus and fallopian tubes. Her elevated temperature indicates an infection, and this is further supported by her high leukocyte count and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate which signify an inflammatory process. In addition to her sexual history, the presence of purulent cervical discharge, and cervical motion tenderness, these findings make PID the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) in a sexually active female presenting with lower abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, and purulent discharge is around 15%. The patient's history of inconsistent condom use increases the posterior probability of PID to about 25%, as it indicates a higher risk for sexually transmitted infections, which can cause PID. The presence of fever, at 38.5�C (101.3�F), further increases the probability to 40%, as PID often presents with an elevated temperature due to the infection. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated at 15,000/mm3 which indicates an infection, and this raises the probability to 60%. The finding of cervical motion tenderness is highly indicative of PID, raising the probability further to around 85%. Finally, the presence of purulent cervical discharge further supports the diagnosis and raises the probability to greater than 90%. Given this constellation of symptoms and signs, the most likely diagnosis is Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).",Answer: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease,Y
"A 25-year-old woman with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, depression, and chronic bilateral ear infections presents to the otolaryngologist's clinic 12 weeks after right ear tympanoplasty. Her audiology report one week prior showed that her hearing improved as expected by 20 decibels. However, she reports that she has occasional shooting pain with eating and when she wears earrings. She states that she has a stressful job as a cashier at the local department store and often sleeps poorly. She denies any neck pain or tenderness when she washes her face. On physical exam, no tenderness is elicited with preauricular or mandibular palpation bilaterally. No jaw clicking is heard. Right postauricular tapping causes tenderness in her right tonsillar area. Her molar teeth appear even and symmetric bilaterally. Her uvula is midline and her gag reflex is intact. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glossopharyngeal neuralgia,TMJ dysfunction,N,Temporomandibular joint dysfunction.,N,TMJ disorder,N,Tonsillitis,N,TMJ dysfunction,N,,"Rationale: The 25-year-old woman had a tympanoplasty 12 weeks ago and currently reports occasional shooting pain while eating or wearing earrings. Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure to repair the eardrum and the pain after this surgery can be due to different reasons. However, the fact that she does not have jaw clicking, no tenderness with preauricular or mandibular palpation, and normal molar teeth alignment makes temporomandibular joint disorders less likely. Also, the absence of neck pain or tenderness on face wash excludes some other disorders. The symptom of shooting pain with ear manipulation and tenderness in the right tonsillar area upon tapping behind the ear can be indicative of an irritation of the auriculotemporal nerve, which is a branch of the trigeminal nerve and has sensory innervation in and around the ear. This irritation is known as Eagle syndrome, which is a condition where an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament causes various symptoms including the ones she has, like pain during eating or wearing earrings.",Answer: Eagle Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient with occasional shooting pain with eating and while wearing earrings, and tenderness in the right tonsillar area upon postauricular tapping, includes temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), referred otalgia secondary to dental pain, Eagle syndrome, postoperative complications from the tympanoplasty, or neuralgia.

TMJ disorder might be suspected, but the absence of jaw clicking or tenderness with mandibular palpation makes it less likely.

Referred otalgia secondary to dental pain might also be considered, but the fact that her molar teeth appear even and symmetric and there's no tenderness with preauricular or mandibular palpation makes it less likely.

Postoperative complications might be suspected due to her recent tympanoplasty, but her audiology report showed improvement and no other signs are present that suggest complications from the surgery.

Neuralgia can cause sharp pain, but usually has a characteristic distribution and doesn't match with the tenderness in the tonsillar area upon tapping postauricular region.

Eagle syndrome is characterized by elongation of the styloid process or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament which can cause pain in the throat and face. Tenderness in the tonsillar area upon postauricular tapping can be a sign of Eagle syndrome.

In light of this patient's presentation, Eagle syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Eagle syndrome,Y,"Rationale: This 25-year-old woman presents with a history of chronic ear infections and a recent tympanoplasty, and her current complaint is of shooting pain with eating and when wearing earrings. It is important to note that there is no tenderness with preauricular or mandibular palpation, and no jaw clicking, which makes temporomandibular joint disorder unlikely. The tenderness elicited in the right tonsillar area with postauricular tapping and the absence of any abnormal findings in molar teeth or uvula point toward a referred pain in the ear due to irritation of the glossopharyngeal nerve, a condition known as Eagle syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by an elongated styloid process and can cause pain in the throat which may radiate to the ear.",Answer: Eagle Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The 25-year-old woman presented with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, depression, and chronic bilateral ear infections. She underwent right ear tympanoplasty and experienced hearing improvement. Her symptoms of occasional shooting pain with eating and wearing earrings, coupled with the finding of tenderness in her right tonsillar area upon right postauricular tapping, are indicative of referred otalgia. Referred otalgia is a condition where the pain originates from a structure outside the ear but is felt within the ear. The symptom of shooting pain with eating suggests a neural component. The absence of tenderness with preauricular or mandibular palpation rules out a temporomandibular joint disorder. In this case, the Eagle syndrome, also known as stylohyoid syndrome, is the most likely diagnosis. It occurs due to an elongated styloid process or calcified stylohyoid ligament, which may cause pain during swallowing, talking, or turning the head. This is often a referred pain and can be caused by nerve impingement from the elongated styloid process.",Answer: Eagle syndrome,Y,"Rationale: Let�s begin with a prior probability of an ear disorder at 30% since the patient has a history of chronic bilateral ear infections. The patient underwent tympanoplasty 12 weeks ago and reported improvement in hearing, which is expected post-tympanoplasty; this does not change our probability significantly. However, the shooting pain with eating and wearing earrings does not typically relate to ear infections or issues related to tympanoplasty, so we can slightly lower the probability of an ear disorder to 25%.

The patient has stress and poor sleep due to her job. These factors could contribute to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Initially, we can assume the prior probability of TMJ disorders is 20%. Absence of jaw clicking and tenderness on mandibular palpation usually associated with TMJ disorders reduces the likelihood, so we adjust the probability of TMJ disorder down to 15%.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings such as tenderness in the right tonsillar area with postauricular tapping are consistent with Eagle syndrome, which involves an elongated styloid process and can cause pain along the distribution of the glossopharyngeal nerve. Let�s assign an initial prior probability for Eagle syndrome at 5%. The tenderness in the tonsillar area with tapping increases the likelihood of Eagle syndrome. This symptom is characteristic, so we can significantly adjust the probability of Eagle syndrome to 60%.

After considering the above findings and probabilities, it is most likely that the patient has Eagle syndrome.",Answer: Eagle syndrome,Y
"A 59-year-old man comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on his face and hands, which developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. He wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when he does not apply sunscreen. The patient was diagnosed with small cell lung carcinoma 2 months ago and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. He is currently taking demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. He has also had occasional back pain. He takes zolpidem and drinks 1–2 glasses of brandy before going to sleep every night. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. His pulse is 72/min and his blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Physical examination shows prominent erythema on his forehead, cheeks, and neck. Erythema and papular eruptions are seen on the dorsum of both hands. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Use of demeclocycline,Sunburn,N,Sunburn,N,Sunburn,N,Sunburn,N,Photosensitivity,Y,,"Rationale: The patient has a red, burning rash on his face and hands that developed shortly after sun exposure. He is currently undergoing chemotherapy and is on medications including demeclocycline. Demeclocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is known to cause photosensitivity, which is an increased sensitivity to sunlight. Photosensitivity can result in an exaggerated sunburn-like reaction even with brief sun exposure, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. The chemotherapy could also make his skin more sensitive. Given that the rash developed shortly after sun exposure and the patient is on a medication known to cause photosensitivity, it is most likely that the rash is due to photosensitivity caused by demeclocycline.",Answer: Photosensitivity from demeclocycline.,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for a red rash on the face and hands following sun exposure in this patient includes phototoxic drug reaction, sunburn, photoallergic reaction, or a cutaneous lupus erythematosus flare.

Sunburn: Since the patient has a history of sunburns, this could be a simple sunburn. However, the rapid onset (30 minutes after sun exposure) and the patient�s use of demeclocycline make this less likely.

Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Flare: Cutaneous lupus can cause a red rash on the face and is known to be triggered by sunlight. However, the patient has no history of lupus and the acute onset of the rash after sun exposure makes this less likely.

Photoallergic Reaction: This is a less common immunologic reaction to sunlight and is usually caused by a reaction between a chemical (often in sunscreen or medication) and ultraviolet light.

Phototoxic Drug Reaction: Demeclocycline, which the patient is taking, is known to cause photosensitivity. This means that the drug makes the skin more sensitive to the damaging effects of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. The symptoms can include redness, burning, and blistering of the skin, which are consistent with the patient�s presentation. Furthermore, the rash developed rapidly after the patient was exposed to sunlight, which is characteristic of a phototoxic reaction.

Considering the patient's medication use (particularly demeclocycline), the rapid onset of the rash after sun exposure, and the characteristics of the rash, the most likely cause of the patient�s symptoms is a phototoxic drug reaction due to demeclocycline.",Answer: Photosensitivity from demeclocycline.,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with a red, painful, burning rash on his face and hands that developed shortly after sun exposure. He is currently undergoing chemotherapy for small cell lung carcinoma and is taking demeclocycline. Demeclocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic which is known to cause photosensitivity as a side effect. Photosensitivity refers to an increased sensitivity to sunlight, and in the case of drugs like demeclocycline, can cause a skin reaction resembling a severe sunburn shortly after exposure to sunlight. Given that the patient was exposed to direct sunlight for a brief period and then developed a rash in the exposed areas, the most likely cause of this patient�s symptoms is a photosensitivity reaction due to his medication, demeclocycline.",Answer: Photosensitivity due to demeclocycline.,Y,"Rationale: The patient is experiencing a painful, burning red rash on his face and hands that developed shortly after sun exposure. He is taking demeclocycline, which is a tetracycline antibiotic. Tetracyclines, including demeclocycline, are known to cause photosensitivity as a side effect. Photosensitivity is a heightened skin sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun or other sources. This reaction can cause the skin to develop a rash, turn red, or become excessively sunburned even after short exposure to UV rays. The patient�s history of being light-skinned and prone to sunburns, combined with the recent exposure to sunlight and the use of a medication known for causing photosensitivity, suggest that the rash is due to a photosensitivity reaction caused by the demeclocycline.",Answer: Photosensitivity reaction,Y,"Rationale: We will use Bayesian inference to deduce the correct response to this question. Let's start with the prior probability of this patient having a photosensitivity reaction to medication, which is generally low among the general population, let's say 1%. However, this patient has several factors that will update our posterior probability:

The patient is taking demeclocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, which is known to cause photosensitivity reactions. Knowing this, the probability of a photosensitivity reaction due to medication increases, let's say to 20%.

The patient developed the rash shortly after being exposed to sunlight (a common trigger for photosensitivity reactions), and the rash is in sun-exposed areas such as the face and hands. This information further increases the probability of a photosensitivity reaction, let's say to 60%.

The patient is light-skinned and has a history of sunburns, which makes him more susceptible to photosensitivity reactions. This information might further increase the probability of a photosensitivity reaction due to medication, let's say to 70%.

Taking all these factors into account, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a photosensitivity reaction due to medication, specifically demeclocycline.",Answer: Photosensitivity due to demeclocycline,Y
"A 2-day old male newborn delivered vaginally at 36 weeks to a 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, has generalized convulsions lasting 2 minutes. Previous to the event, he had difficulty feeding and was lethargic. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Pregnancy and delivery of the mother's first 2 children were also uncomplicated. Medications of the mother include folic acid and a multivitamin. The mother's immunizations are up-to-date. The infant appears icteric. His vital signs are within normal limits. The infant's weight and length are at the 5th percentile, and his head circumference at the 99th percentile for gestational age. There are several purpura of the skin. Ocular examination shows posterior uveitis. The patient does not pass his auditory screening tests. Cranial ultrasonography shows ventricular dilatation, as well as hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital toxoplasmosis,Neonatal sepsis,N,Neonatal sepsis,N,Neonatal meningitis,N,Intraventricular hemorrhage,N,Neonatal lupus,N,,"Rationale: The 2-day old newborn has several symptoms and findings that are suggestive of a congenital infection. These include difficulty in feeding, lethargy, convulsions, icterus, purpura on the skin, posterior uveitis, and abnormal cranial ultrasonography with ventricular dilatation and hyperechoic foci. These findings are characteristic of Congenital Toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, which the infant could have acquired in utero from the mother. Congenital Toxoplasmosis classically presents with the triad of chorioretinitis (inflammation of the eyes), hydrocephalus (ventricular dilatation) and intracranial calcifications (hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region). The icterus and purpura on the skin may indicate liver involvement or hematologic manifestations. The patient�s failure to pass auditory screening tests also aligns with this diagnosis, as hearing impairment can be a feature of congenital toxoplasmosis.",Answer: Congenital Toxoplasmosis,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnoses for this newborn with generalized convulsions, difficulty feeding, lethargy, icterus, purpura, posterior uveitis, ventricular dilatation, and hyperechoic foci in the brain include hypoglycemia, neonatal sepsis, kernicterus, hypocalcemia, and congenital infections like toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes (TORCH infections). Hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia could lead to convulsions, but they would not account for the ocular findings or cranial ultrasonography results. Neonatal sepsis could explain some findings, but the characteristic ocular findings and brain changes make this less likely. Kernicterus, a severe form of jaundice, would cause icterus and lethargy but wouldn�t account for the purpura or ocular findings. The constellation of symptoms including purpura, ocular changes, and brain changes in the newborn are characteristic of TORCH infections, specifically congenital CMV infection. Congenital cytomegalovirus infection often leads to intrauterine growth restriction (consistent with the infant's weight at the 5th percentile), microcephaly, periventricular calcifications (hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region on cranial ultrasonography), and hearing loss, which are present in this patient.",Answer: Congenital Cytomegalovirus Infection,N,"Rationale: The 2-day old male newborn presents with generalized convulsions, difficulty feeding, lethargy, icterus, purpura on the skin, posterior uveitis, and failure of auditory screening tests. The cranial ultrasonography shows ventricular dilatation and hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region. These findings are highly suggestive of congenital infection. The presence of ocular involvement (uveitis), auditory impairment, and intracranial calcifications (hyperechoic foci) are characteristic of Congenital Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can be transmitted from the mother to the fetus during pregnancy, and can lead to severe manifestations in the newborn, as seen in this case.",Answer: Congenital Toxoplasmosis,Y,"Rationale: The infant presented with generalized convulsions, difficulty in feeding, lethargy, icterus, purpura of the skin, posterior uveitis, and failed auditory screening tests. In addition, the infant has an enlarged head circumference and cranial ultrasonography reveals ventricular dilatation and hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region. These clinical features are indicative of congenital infection, particularly congenital toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma gondii, the parasite responsible for toxoplasmosis, can be transmitted from an infected mother to her fetus during pregnancy. Congenital toxoplasmosis is characterized by symptoms such as intracranial calcifications, hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, seizures, and jaundice. The presence of intracranial calcifications, as indicated by hyperechoic foci, in addition to other neurological and ocular manifestations, are highly suggestive of congenital toxoplasmosis in this newborn.",Answer: Congenital toxoplasmosis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Congenital Toxoplasmosis in a newborn with nonspecific signs such as lethargy and feeding difficulty is low. However, let's incrementally assess the findings:

The occurrence of convulsions in a 2-day old newborn increases the likelihood of a congenital infection.
The appearance of jaundice (icteric appearance) and purpura on the skin raises suspicion for a hematological issue or infection.
The head circumference being at the 99th percentile for gestational age indicates the possibility of hydrocephalus, which is a classic sign of congenital toxoplasmosis.
Ocular examination shows posterior uveitis, which is consistent with congenital toxoplasmosis.
The infant does not pass auditory screening tests, indicating sensorineural hearing loss which is also a feature of congenital toxoplasmosis.
Cranial ultrasonography showing ventricular dilation, and hyperechoic foci within the cortex, basal ganglia, and periventricular region is highly suggestive of an infection like toxoplasmosis.
Given these clinical findings, the posterior probability of Congenital Toxoplasmosis increases significantly. The combination of hydrocephalus, ocular findings, and intracranial calcifications are considered the classic triad for congenital toxoplasmosis.",Answer: Congenital Toxoplasmosis,Y
"A previously healthy 2-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother after she noticed multiple painless, nonpruritic papules on her abdomen. The child attends daycare three times per week, and this past week one child was reported to have similar lesions. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Her brother had chickenpox one month ago. She is at the 50th percentile for height and the 60th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows several skin-colored, nontender, pearly papules with central umbilication on the abdomen and extremities. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Molluscum contagiosum,Molluscum contagiosum,Y,Molluscum contagiosum,Y,Molluscum contagiosum,Y,Molluscum contagiosum,Y,Molluscum contagiosum,Y,,"Rationale: The 2-year-old girl presents with multiple skin-colored, nonpruritic, painless papules with central umbilication on the abdomen and extremities. These findings are characteristic of Molluscum Contagiosum, which is a viral infection of the skin caused by a poxvirus. It is common in children and spreads through direct contact or shared objects, and the fact that another child in her daycare has similar lesions supports this diagnosis. This condition is different from chickenpox, which usually presents with itchy blisters, and it is worth noting that her brother had chickenpox a month ago. However, the description of the lesions being pearly with central umbilication is classic for Molluscum Contagiosum.",Answer: Molluscum Contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this 2-year-old girl includes molluscum contagiosum, chickenpox, impetigo, and warts. Chickenpox can be ruled out because chickenpox vesicles are typically very pruritic and the child's brother had chickenpox one month ago; she likely would have shown symptoms already if it was chickenpox. Impetigo usually presents with honey-crusted lesions and is pruritic as well. Warts usually lack the central umbilication seen in the description. On the other hand, molluscum contagiosum is characterized by painless, skin-colored, pearly papules with central umbilication, which fits the description given. Additionally, molluscum contagiosum is contagious and it's relevant that another child in her daycare was reported to have similar lesions. The clinical presentation strongly suggests molluscum contagiosum.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: The child presents with multiple, painless, non-pruritic, skin-colored papules with a central umbilication on the abdomen and extremities. This clinical presentation is highly suggestive of Molluscum Contagiosum, a common viral infection in children caused by the Molluscum Contagiosum virus. This infection is characterized by the development of pearly, umbilicated papules and is typically benign and self-limiting. The virus can spread easily through direct contact, and the fact that another child in her daycare was reported to have similar lesions supports the likelihood of this diagnosis.",Answer: Molluscum Contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a previously healthy 2-year-old girl presenting with painless, non-pruritic papules with central umbilication on her abdomen and extremities. The fact that she attends daycare, where there is close contact with other children, suggests that the condition could be contagious. Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral infection in children characterized by the presentation of skin-colored, pearly papules with a central dimple or umbilication. It is caused by the molluscum contagiosum virus, a member of the poxvirus family, and is spread through direct contact or sharing of personal items. The history of another child in her daycare having similar lesions further supports the diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Molluscum contagiosum in a child attending daycare is around 5%. The presence of painless, pearly papules with central umbilication increases the likelihood of Molluscum contagiosum to about 40%. Since there is a report of another child in the daycare with similar lesions, this increases the probability further to about 70%. Additionally, Molluscum contagiosum is more common in children and can be spread through contact which aligns with the child's attendance in daycare, taking the probability to around 80%. Given these factors, Molluscum contagiosum is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Molluscum contagiosum,Y
"A 58-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department after he was found unconscious in his living room by his wife. She reports that he has never had a similar episode before. The patient has hypertension and consumes multiple alcoholic drinks per day. On arrival, he is confused and oriented only to person. He cannot recall what happened. He has difficulty speaking and his words are slurred. He reports a diffuse headache and muscle pain and appears fatigued. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 135/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm bruise on his right shoulder. Strength is 5/5 throughout, except for 1/5 in the left arm. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",Seizure,Stroke,N,Stroke,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Alcohol intoxication,N,Stroke,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 58-year-old right-handed man who was found unconscious and is now confused, with difficulty speaking and slurred words, along with a diffuse headache and muscle pain. He has a history of hypertension and consumes alcohol heavily. He also has a noted weakness in the left arm. His CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities, which is important because it likely rules out intracranial hemorrhage. Considering his history of hypertension and heavy alcohol consumption, along with his neurological symptoms and CT findings, this scenario is suggestive of a stroke, specifically an ischemic stroke, which might not be visible on a CT scan immediately.",Answer: Ischemic Stroke,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), hypoglycemia, seizures, intoxication, and hypertensive encephalopathy. The patient's confusion, slurred speech, and weakness in the left arm suggest a neurological issue. Given his history of hypertension and alcohol consumption, he is at a higher risk for cerebrovascular accidents. A CT scan of the head without contrast showing no abnormalities may not rule out an ischemic stroke since changes may not be evident initially. Moreover, the CT scan is not sensitive for small or very acute infarcts. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG supports chronic hypertension, a risk factor for stroke. The sudden onset, focal neurological deficits (weakness in the left arm), and confusion are more indicative of an ischemic stroke rather than other differentials.",Answer: Ischemic stroke,N,"Rationale: The patient presented is a 58-year-old man who was found unconscious and is now confused and oriented only to person. He has difficulty speaking with slurred speech and reports a diffuse headache and muscle pain. He has a history of hypertension and alcohol consumption. He has left arm weakness but strength is normal elsewhere. His CT scan of the head shows no abnormalities. The clinical presentation is suggestive of a stroke, particularly in the distribution of the right middle cerebral artery due to the left arm weakness and speech difficulty. His history of hypertension and alcohol consumption are significant risk factors for stroke. The normal CT scan does not rule out a stroke as ischemic strokes may not be visible on a CT scan initially.",Answer: Ischemic Stroke,N,"Rationale: The patient in question is a 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension and chronic alcohol consumption who was found unconscious. On examination, he is confused, has slurred speech, reports a headache and muscle pain, and has noticeable weakness in the left arm. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG is consistent with his history of hypertension. His history of chronic alcohol consumption coupled with hypertension makes him susceptible to a cerebrovascular event. Though the CT scan is normal, it is important to recognize that early ischemic changes in the brain may not be evident on a CT scan immediately following an ischemic stroke. His confusion, slurred speech, and weakness in the left arm suggest a focal neurological deficit, likely due to an interruption of blood flow to the brain, specifically affecting the areas responsible for speech and right arm motor function. This clinical scenario is highly suggestive of an ischemic stroke, possibly caused by chronic hypertension and alcohol consumption which are risk factors for stroke.",Answer: Ischemic Stroke,N,"Rationale: Let's analyze the patient's information step by step. The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension and chronic alcohol consumption, who was found unconscious and is currently confused, has slurred speech, diffuse headache, muscle pain, and weakness in the left arm. The prior probability that this is due to a stroke is approximately 10%.

His age and hypertension are risk factors for a stroke. Considering these, the probability of a stroke goes up to about 20%.

The fact that he was found unconscious and is confused upon regaining consciousness further increases the likelihood that this is due to a stroke. Let's increase the probability to around 40%.

The patient has difficulty speaking and slurred speech, which is suggestive of dysarthria, a common symptom in stroke. This would further increase the probability of stroke to around 60%.

He has 1/5 strength in his left arm. Hemiparesis, especially when it's one-sided, is a hallmark of stroke. This increases the probability to around 80%.

The patient�s history of chronic alcohol consumption may contribute to both hypertension and a higher risk of stroke. This increases the probability marginally.

A CT scan shows no abnormalities, which is common in the early stages of an ischemic stroke as changes might not be visible immediately.

Combining this information, the posterior probability of the patient having suffered a stroke is high, and this seems to be the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",Answer: Stroke,N
"A 47-year-old man presents to the clinic for an evaluation of intense itching of his right thigh region for the past few days. He states some ‘red bumps’ just began to form. The patient mentions that he was recently at a business conference in Miami. He has a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes type 2, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He does not smoke or drink. His vitals are within normal limits today. On physical examination, a linear line with 3 red papules is present along the medial aspect of his right thigh. Additionally, there are small rows of bumps on his left leg and right forearm. Excoriations are also apparent in the same region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bed bug bite,Scabies,N,Dengue fever,N,Scabies,N,Scabies,N,Scabies,N,,"Rationale: The patient has a presentation of intense itching along with red papules in a linear pattern. The pattern of a linear line with multiple papules is highly suggestive of a contact dermatitis due to an external cause. The patient mentioned recent travel to Miami. Given the description of the skin findings, and the history of recent travel to a place where insects such as mosquitoes and bedbugs are common, the most likely diagnosis is an insect bite reaction. The linear pattern of the bites is characteristic of bed bug bites.",Answer: Bed bug bites,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes allergic reactions, insect bites, dermatitis, fungal infection, and other skin infections. The linear arrangement of red papules, especially after a recent stay in a hotel (business conference in Miami), is characteristic of bed bug bites. Allergic reactions and dermatitis usually present with a more diffuse rash, whereas fungal infection generally has a more localized and well-defined border. The excoriations are likely due to the patient scratching the itchy areas. Additionally, the patient's systemic symptoms are absent and vitals are normal, which makes a systemic allergic reaction unlikely. Given the history and the characteristic appearance of the skin lesions, bed bug bites are the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Bed bug bites,Y,"Rationale: The patient is presenting with intense itching and red bumps that are linearly arranged on the right thigh and also in small rows on the left leg and right forearm. The presence of excoriations in the same region suggests the patient has been scratching the area. This patient's history of recent travel to Miami, a humid and subtropical environment, coupled with the characteristic linear arrangement of papules, is highly suggestive of exposure to the Sarcoptes scabiei mite, which causes scabies. Scabies is transmitted through close personal contact or contact with contaminated clothing or bedding. The mites burrow into the skin to lay eggs, causing an intense pruritic rash.",Answer: Scabies,N,"Rationale: The patient presents with intense itching, red bumps, and a linear line with 3 red papules on the medial aspect of his right thigh, as well as small rows of bumps on his left leg and right forearm. His recent travel to Miami, a region known for its humid climate and prevalence of insects, hints at a potential exposure to pests. The pattern of skin lesions suggests that this is not a systemic allergic or inflammatory reaction, but rather a result of localized external factors. The linear arrangement of the papules is characteristic of a path where an arthropod, such as a mite, might have burrowed into the skin. The intense itching and red papules are indicative of an inflammatory reaction to the mite and its products. The clinical presentation is highly suggestive of scabies, which is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei burrowing into the skin and laying eggs, leading to an intensely pruritic rash with characteristic burrows.",Answer: Scabies,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of the patient having insect bites might be around 10%. Considering that he has recently traveled to Miami, an area known to have mosquitoes and other insects, this increases the posterior probability of insect bites to around 30%. The presence of red bumps that are itchy further increases the probability to 50%. Finally, the physical examination revealing a linear line with 3 red papules along the medial aspect of his right thigh, which is characteristic of insect bites, increases the probability to 80%. The presence of excoriations (indicating scratching) also aligns with the itching that commonly accompanies insect bites. Given these findings, the patient is most likely experiencing the results of insect bites.",Answer: Insect bites,N
"A 66-year-old white man comes to the physician because of a 10-day history of fatigue and lower leg swelling. Over the past 6 months, he has had a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss. He has chronic bronchitis and uses an albuterol inhaler as needed. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years and drinks one alcoholic beverage daily.

An x-ray of the chest shows a right upper lobe density. A CT scan of the chest shows a 2.5 x 3.5 x 2-cm right upper lobe mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Membranous nephropathy,Lung cancer,N,Lung cancer,N,Lung cancer,N,Malignancy,N,Lung cancer,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 66-year-old man who has been smoking for 44 years and has chronic bronchitis. He presents with fatigue, lower leg swelling, weight loss, and lab studies indicating hypoalbuminemia (low albumin), proteinuria (excess protein in urine), hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol), and renal impairment. A chest x-ray shows a right upper lobe density, and a CT scan reveals a mass in the same location. The findings of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, and edema are characteristic of nephrotic syndrome, which is likely secondary to a malignancy, given the history of smoking and the presence of a lung mass. This pattern of nephrotic syndrome secondary to malignancy is known as paraneoplastic syndrome. Given the patient's long history of smoking and the findings of a lung mass on imaging, the most likely diagnosis is lung cancer with associated paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome.",Answer: Lung cancer,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, lung cancer, and chronic kidney disease. Given that the patient has a long history of smoking, COPD and lung cancer should be considered. However, the lower leg swelling, hypoalbuminemia, and proteinuria strongly suggest a kidney issue, likely nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome may cause hypoalbuminemia, which leads to lower oncotic pressure in blood vessels and subsequently edema. Also, nephrotic syndrome is associated with hypercholesterolemia, which matches the patient�s lab finding of elevated total cholesterol. The presence of a right upper lobe mass in a patient with a significant smoking history, however, cannot be ignored and may be the primary pathology with nephrotic syndrome as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. In this scenario, nephrotic syndrome may be secondary to the production of nephrotoxic substances by the tumor, or due to immune responses related to the malignancy. The most likely diagnosis in this case is lung cancer with paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome.",Answer: Lung cancer,N,"Rationale: This patient presents with a history of chronic smoking and a right upper lobe mass on imaging, which raises the suspicion of lung cancer. Furthermore, he has findings suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, including hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin), peripheral edema, and proteinuria (4+ protein on urine dipstick). In addition, he has hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol 475 mg/dL), which is another characteristic of nephrotic syndrome. Given the findings of a lung mass along with nephrotic syndrome, this raises the suspicion of a paraneoplastic syndrome secondary to lung cancer. There is an association between malignancies, particularly lung cancer, and the development of glomerular disease such as membranous nephropathy which can present as nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is lung cancer associated with a paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome.",Answer: Lung cancer with paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome,N,"Rationale: This patient has a history of chronic smoking and chronic bronchitis, which are risk factors for lung cancer. The presence of a right upper lobe mass on CT scan also suggests the possibility of lung cancer. Furthermore, the patient has fatigue, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia, which can be associated with a paraneoplastic syndrome caused by lung cancer known as nephrotic syndrome. In nephrotic syndrome, there is damage to the blood vessels in the kidneys that leads to protein leakage into the urine. This is reflected in this patient's lab values with 4+ proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 1.8 mg/dL). Additionally, the presence of edema in his lower legs is likely due to hypoalbuminemia leading to decreased oncotic pressure. The elevated total cholesterol is also a common finding in nephrotic syndrome. The combination of the lung mass along with signs of nephrotic syndrome in a chronic smoker is highly suggestive of lung cancer with paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome.",Answer: Lung cancer,N,"Rationale: The patient in the scenario is a 66-year-old man with a history of chronic bronchitis who has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 44 years. This long history of smoking puts him at a higher risk for lung cancer. The prior probability of lung cancer in a long-term smoker can be estimated to be around 15%. He also presents with unexplained weight loss, fatigue, and lower leg swelling. Weight loss is a common symptom of cancer and can raise the probability to around 25%.

Now, the laboratory findings are also significant. The patient has hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels) and proteinuria (high protein levels in urine), which can be indicative of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome can sometimes be associated with malignancies like lung cancer, raising the probability to around 35%.

Furthermore, the chest X-ray shows a right upper lobe density and a subsequent CT scan of the chest shows a 2.5 x 3.5 x 2-cm right upper lobe mass. A lung mass in the setting of a long history of smoking is highly suggestive of lung cancer, increasing the probability further to above 85%. Considering all these factors together, lung cancer is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Lung cancer,N
"A 75-year-old man presents to the physician with progressive difficulty reading over the past year. Currently, he avoids driving as he has trouble reading road signs. He has no history of a serious illness and takes no medications. The fundoscopic examination shows localized retinal elevation and drusen. A description of the patient’s visual on the Amsler grid is shown. Fluorescein angiography shows early hyperfluorescence. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Macular degeneration,Age-related macular degeneration,Y,Age-related macular degeneration.,Y,Age-related macular degeneration,Y,Age-related Macular Degeneration,Y,AMD,Y,,"Rationale: This 75-year-old patient presents with a gradual difficulty in reading and trouble seeing road signs, indicative of a decline in visual acuity. The absence of a significant medical history and the absence of medications suggest the problem is likely age-related. The fundoscopic examination showed localized retinal elevation and drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina, and they are common in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The early hyperfluorescence in fluorescein angiography is also indicative of choroidal neovascularization, which is seen in the wet form of AMD. Given the age of the patient, the findings of drusen, and the changes in the retina, the most likely diagnosis is age-related macular degeneration.",Answer: Age-related macular degeneration,Y,"Rationale: In the case of a 75-year-old man who presents with progressive difficulty in reading and trouble seeing road signs, the differential diagnoses include age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal detachment. The patient's age and the absence of any other serious illnesses make age-related macular degeneration more likely. The presence of drusen, which are small yellowish deposits under the retina, is a characteristic finding in AMD. The localized retinal elevation can indicate the development of neovascularization, which is typical in wet AMD. Fluorescein angiography showing early hyperfluorescence is also indicative of choroidal neovascularization seen in wet AMD. The Amsler grid test, which was described but not shown, is often used to detect visual disturbances typical in AMD. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is wet age-related macular degeneration.",Answer: Wet age-related macular degeneration,Y,"Rationale: This 75-year-old man presents with difficulty in reading and trouble in reading road signs which have been progressive over the past year. The fundoscopic examination reveals localized retinal elevation and drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina and are commonly seen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Fluorescein angiography showing early hyperfluorescence is also consistent with AMD. AMD is a common eye condition among people age 50 and older, and is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. It gradually destroys the macula, which provides sharp, central vision needed for seeing objects clearly. Given the patient�s age, symptoms, and findings on the fundoscopic examination and fluorescein angiography, age-related macular degeneration is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Age-related macular degeneration,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a 75-year-old man with progressive difficulty in reading and trouble reading road signs, which indicates a central vision problem. Fundoscopic examination reveals localized retinal elevation and drusen. Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina, and are often found in individuals over the age of 60. These findings are characteristic of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The macula is a part of the retina responsible for central vision, and in AMD, it deteriorates, causing central vision loss. Fluorescein angiography showing early hyperfluorescence further supports this diagnosis. There are two types of AMD - wet and dry. The presence of retinal elevation suggests the wet type, in which there is abnormal blood vessel growth under the retina. This is consistent with the findings on fluorescein angiography, which helps visualize the blood vessels in the retina and can indicate new, abnormal blood vessel growth, a characteristic of wet AMD.",Answer: Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration,Y,"Rationale: We can start with a prior probability for Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) in a 75-year-old person, which is around 15%. This patient has a complaint of difficulty in reading and recognizing road signs which indicates a central vision problem, this increases the posterior probability of AMD to around 30%. Fundoscopic examination reveals drusen, which is typical in AMD, further increasing the probability to 50%. The localized retinal elevation may indicate neovascularization or wet AMD, raising the probability to 65%. The fluorescein angiography showing early hyperfluorescence, which is consistent with choroidal neovascularization seen in wet AMD, brings the probability to around 80%. All these findings point towards the most likely diagnosis of Age-related Macular Degeneration, particularly the wet type.",Answer: Age-related Macular Degeneration,Y
"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of generalized fatigue and easy bruising. During the past week, she has also had fever and severe leg pain that wakes her up at night. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 120/min, and respirations are 30/min. Examination shows cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. The abdomen is soft and nontender; the liver is palpated 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:

A bone marrow aspirate predominantly shows immature cells that stain positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Y,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Y,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Y,Acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Y,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,Y,,"Rationale: The 4-year-old girl in the question presents with fatigue, easy bruising, fever, severe leg pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and abnormal laboratory findings including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with a predominance of immature cells in the bone marrow. These clinical features are consistent with a hematologic malignancy. The bone marrow aspirate shows immature cells that stain positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT. CD10 and CD19 are markers typically expressed on B cells and their precursors, and TdT is a marker of immature lymphoid cells. The combination of these markers is characteristic of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), which is a malignancy of the bone marrow and blood characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells.",Answer: B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for a 4-year-old girl with fatigue, easy bruising, fever, severe leg pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and abnormal blood counts could include infections, hematologic disorders, or malignancies such as leukemia or lymphoma. Notably, the significantly elevated leukocyte count, anemia (hemoglobin of 10.1 g/dL), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 27,000/mm3) suggest a hematologic malignancy. The bone marrow aspirate showing predominantly immature cells is indicative of a process such as leukemia, where immature blood cells proliferate. The presence of CD10, CD19, and TdT markers is characteristic of precursor B cells, which are found in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). B-ALL is a common childhood malignancy that fits the clinical picture described for this child. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Answer: B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The child is presenting with fever, generalized fatigue, easy bruising, and severe leg pain, symptoms that together suggest a hematologic disease. The leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), anemia (low hemoglobin), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) further suggest a disease of the blood cells. Cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen) are common in blood cell cancers. The bone marrow aspirate showing a predominance of immature cells that stain positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT suggests an immature B-cell lineage, which is characteristic of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), a common childhood cancer.",Answer: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The patient has symptoms of fatigue, easy bruising, fever, and severe leg pain, which suggest a systemic and possibly malignant disorder. The physical examination findings of lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly also suggest a hematologic malignancy. The lab findings show anemia (low hemoglobin), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and leukocytosis (high white blood cell count), which is indicative of a bone marrow disorder. The bone marrow aspirate shows predominantly immature cells that are positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT. These markers are associated with B lymphocytes. CD10, CD19, and TdT positivity is often seen in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), which is the most common cancer in children. This constellation of symptoms, physical examination findings, and lab findings are most consistent with ALL.",Answer: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in a child with generalized fatigue, fever, and easy bruising is around 5%. However, the presence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone pain increases the posterior probability of ALL to around 40%. Laboratory findings showing leukocytosis with a predominance of immature cells further increase the probability to 70%. The findings of low hemoglobin and platelet count, symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia respectively, increase this probability further to around 85%. Lastly, the cells from the bone marrow aspirate staining positive for CD10, CD19, and TdT, which are markers of B-cell lineage, confirms the diagnosis of B-cell ALL, and the probability now reaches nearly 100%. So, the patient likely has acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",Answer: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,Y
"A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police at 2:00 AM. They picked him up from a local nightclub, where he was yelling and threatening to fight the staff. A review of his medical record is unremarkable. At the hospital, his behavior continues to be agitated and bizarre. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the blood pressure is 162/98 mm Hg, the heart rate is 120/min, the respiratory rate is 18/min, and the oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable for agitation, but otherwise, he appears healthy. His thin nasal mucosa oozes blood and his pupils are 2mm, equal, and reactive to light. His speech is pressured and bizarre. He insists the hospital should let him go because “I am in the FBI”. Urine toxicology is sent to the laboratory for analysis. What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",Cocaine intoxication,Stimulant intoxication,Y,Drug intoxication,N,Drug intoxication,N,Intoxication,N,Stimulant intoxication,Y,,"Rationale: This 23-year-old male patient is presenting with symptoms including agitation, bizarre behavior, pressured and unusual speech, and a raised blood pressure and heart rate. These symptoms can be associated with drug use, particularly the use of stimulants. His physical exam reveals bloody nasal mucosa, a common symptom of snorting drugs, and small pupils which are commonly seen with opioid use, but can also occur with stimulant use if it's intense enough. However, opioids typically lead to sedation rather than agitation, and the bizarre and agitated behavior with the high blood pressure and heart rate suggests more towards stimulant use such as cocaine or amphetamines. The fact that he was picked up from a nightclub further suggests the possibility of recreational drug use.",Answer: Stimulant drug use.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms include agitation, bizarre behavior, nasal bleeding (suggestive of possible insufflation of drugs), pressured and bizarre speech, and elevated blood pressure and heart rate. The differential diagnosis here includes substance intoxication (e.g., cocaine, amphetamines, hallucinogens), acute psychosis, mania, and delirium due to a medical condition. The context provided (picked up from a nightclub), the presence of physical signs suggesting sympathomimetic toxicity (hypertension, tachycardia), and the thin bleeding nasal mucosa suggesting possible insufflation make substance intoxication most likely. The bizarre, pressured speech, and delusions could suggest a primary psychiatric disorder like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but these conditions would not account for the nasal bleeding or the significantly elevated vital signs. Acute medical conditions such as thyroid storm or pheochromocytoma could potentially produce similar symptoms but would be less likely in a young, otherwise healthy individual. Moreover, the history does not suggest a recent start of medications that could induce such a state (e.g., steroids, anticholinergics). Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is substance abuse, particularly of a stimulant like cocaine or amphetamines.",Answer: Substance intoxication,N,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of agitation, bizarre behavior, hypertension, tachycardia, and pressured speech suggests a state of intense sympathetic nervous system stimulation. This could be due to a variety of causes such as an intoxication or a psychiatric condition. His statement that he is in the FBI, which is likely delusional, suggests a possible psychosis. However, the finding of a bleeding nasal mucosa and small (miotic) pupils could suggest the use of a vasoconstrictive recreational drug. Notably, cocaine is associated with causing these symptoms due to its vasoconstrictive and stimulant properties. Although small pupils are often associated with opioid use, the rest of the presentation does not fit with opioid intoxication which typically causes sedation and respiratory depression. Hence, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is cocaine intoxication, which can induce sympathetic overdrive and potentially delirium or psychosis in severe cases.",Answer: Cocaine intoxication.,Y,"Rationale: This young man presents with acute agitation, aggression, pressured speech, elevated heart rate and blood pressure, along with bleeding from his nasal mucosa. His symptom profile, particularly with the nasal bleeding and the night-time presentation, strongly suggests the use of a sympathomimetic recreational drug, likely cocaine. Cocaine is commonly insufflated (snorted) which can cause nasal mucosa damage and bleeding. It causes central nervous system stimulation which can lead to agitation, aggression, paranoia (such as believing he is part of the FBI), and other bizarre behavior. The increased release and decreased reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin that cocaine causes can also lead to significant increases in heart rate and blood pressure.",Answer: Cocaine intoxication,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of substance abuse, specifically stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamines, in this setting might be set at around 20%. The patient's bizarre behavior, agitation, and pressured speech can suggest substance-induced psychosis, which increases the probability to 40%. The presence of hypertension and tachycardia, which are symptoms of stimulant use, further increases the probability to 60%. The observation of thin, bloody nasal mucosa could suggest nasal insufflation of a stimulant, such as cocaine, which raises the probability to 80%. Given the lack of other probable causes in a young, previously healthy man, the posterior probability of stimulant abuse causing this patient's presentation is very high.",Answer: Stimulant Abuse,Y
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of sadness that started 6 weeks after her 9-month-old daughter was born. Since then, she has not returned to work. Her daughter usually sleeps through the night, but the patient still has difficulty staying asleep. She is easily distracted from normal daily tasks. She used to enjoy cooking, but only orders delivery or take-out now. She says that she always feels too exhausted to do so and does not feel hungry much anyway. The pregnancy of the patient's child was complicated by gestational diabetes. The child was born at 36-weeks' gestation and has had no medical issues. The patient has no contact with the child's father. She is not sexually active. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. She is 157 cm (5 ft 1 in) tall and weighs 47 kg (105 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is alert and cooperative but makes little eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Major depressive disorder,Postpartum depression,N,Postpartum depression,N,Postpartum depression,N,Postpartum depression,N,Postpartum depression,N,,"Rationale: The woman is presenting several symptoms including persistent sadness, a change in sleep pattern (difficulty staying asleep even when her daughter does), difficulty in concentrating, change in eating habits (ordering takeout instead of cooking, reduced hunger), and a loss of interest in a previously enjoyed activity (cooking). These symptoms have lasted for more than two weeks and appear to be affecting her daily functioning. Moreover, they began after a significant life event (childbirth), which is commonly associated with mood disorders. All these symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder. While postpartum depression is typically considered in the first month after childbirth, this is a diagnosis of exclusion and the woman's symptoms have lasted for longer and are significant enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.",Answer: Major Depressive Disorder,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes: major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, postpartum blues, postpartum depression, and adjustment disorder.

She exhibits several symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD), such as sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, decreased appetite, and low mood. However, the onset of these symptoms, 6 weeks after the birth of her child, combined with the severity and duration of symptoms, points more towards postpartum depression.

Postpartum blues is less likely as it typically presents within days after delivery and resolves spontaneously within two weeks. Generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and adjustment disorder are also less likely given her symptom profile and the timing of symptom onset.

The key features of postpartum depression are depression or loss of interest in usual activities beginning within the first year after childbirth, associated with significant distress or functional impairment. This patient's symptoms started six weeks postpartum, which aligns with the typical timing of onset for postpartum depression.",Answer: Postpartum depression.,N,"Rationale: This patient is demonstrating signs of persistent sadness, anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities), insomnia, fatigue, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and decreased appetite, which have persisted for longer than two weeks. These symptoms strongly suggest a major depressive disorder, especially given that they began postpartum (within weeks after the birth of her child). This indicates a high probability of postpartum depression. Although postpartum depression typically begins within the first month after childbirth, it can start anytime within the first year.",Answer: Postpartum Depression,N,"Rationale: This patient has had persistent sadness and anhedonia (loss of interest in activities that were previously pleasurable such as cooking), insomnia, decreased appetite, and impaired concentration since her daughter's birth 9 months ago. These symptoms significantly interfere with her daily functioning, as indicated by her inability to return to work. They also began after childbirth and have lasted longer than 2 weeks. These are characteristic symptoms of a major depressive episode. The onset of symptoms after childbirth in this case suggests postpartum depression, which can begin anytime within the first year after childbirth. It is important to note that postpartum depression is not the ""baby blues,"" which is a transient depressive state that affects up to 70% of new mothers and resolves within 10 days. Postpartum depression, like other forms of depression, requires treatment with psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medication.",Answer: Postpartum Depression,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of postpartum depression in the general population is about 10-15%. However, this woman is showing several symptoms that are characteristic of postpartum depression, so we have to update our probabilities with this new evidence. She has reported sadness, a common symptom of depression, which increases the probability to about 30%. Her difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and inability to concentrate on daily tasks further increase the probability to 50%. Moreover, she has lost interest in an activity she used to enjoy (cooking), a symptom known as anhedonia, which pushes the probability up to 70%. Her decreased appetite, low energy, and the fact that these symptoms started after the birth of her child and have lasted for over two weeks further increase the probability to about 85-90%. Lastly, she has no contact with the child's father which could potentially increase stress and feelings of isolation, further supporting the likelihood of postpartum depression. This patient most likely has postpartum depression.",Answer: De Quervain's tenosynovitis,N
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of pain in her right thumb and wrist that radiates to her elbow. It is worse when she holds her infant son and improves with the use of an ice pack. Six months ago, she slipped on a wet floor and fell on her right outstretched hand. Her mother takes methotrexate for chronic joint pain. The patient takes ibuprofen as needed for her current symptoms. Examination of the right hand shows tenderness over the radial styloid with swelling but no redness. There is no crepitus. Grasping her right thumb and exerting longitudinal traction toward the ulnar side elicits pain. Range of motion of the finger joints is normal. There is no swelling, redness, or tenderness of any other joints. What is the most likely diagnosis?",De Quervain tenosynovitis,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y,De Quervain's Tenosynovitis,Y,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y,,"Rationale: This patient presents with pain in her right thumb and wrist that worsens with specific activities and improves with rest or an ice pack, which suggests a mechanical origin of the pain. The mechanism of injury - a fall on an outstretched hand - is a common cause of trauma to the wrist. The tenderness on the radial styloid and pain elicited by longitudinal traction towards the ulnar side are both suggestive of de Quervain's tenosynovitis, a condition caused by inflammation of the tendon sheath of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. The thumb tendons, the abductor pollicis longus and the extensor pollicis brevis, pass through this compartment. Overuse, such as frequent lifting of a baby, is a common cause of this condition.",Answer: De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, de Quervain tenosynovitis, scaphoid fracture, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Her history of falling on an outstretched hand might suggest a fracture, but the duration of symptoms and lack of acute presentation make this unlikely. Osteoarthritis would typically present in older patients and affect multiple joints. Rheumatoid arthritis would generally cause more systemic symptoms and affect more than one joint, typically presenting symmetrically. The fact that her mother has chronic joint pain (possibly rheumatoid arthritis given the treatment with methotrexate) might point towards a genetic predisposition for an inflammatory arthritis, but the patient's presentation is not characteristic for rheumatoid arthritis.

The symptom of pain that's worse when she holds her infant son (a repetitive action that would strain the tendons of the thumb) and the physical examination finding of tenderness over the radial styloid process both suggest de Quervain tenosynovitis. The positive test result from the Finkelstein's test (grasping the thumb and exerting longitudinal traction toward the ulnar side) confirms this, as this maneuver exacerbates the symptoms of de Quervain tenosynovitis.",Answer: de Quervain tenosynovitis,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with pain in her right thumb and wrist that radiates to her elbow, and which is exacerbated by carrying her infant. This, along with the history of a fall on an outstretched hand, indicates that the cause of her symptoms is likely related to a musculoskeletal injury rather than a systemic issue such as rheumatoid arthritis (given the mother's history of chronic joint pain). The maneuver of grasping the thumb and applying ulnar deviation, which provokes her pain, is called the Finkelstein's test, which is highly suggestive of De Quervain's tenosynovitis, an inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. This condition is commonly seen in new mothers and those who've had a wrist injury.",Answer: De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms are indicative of De Quervain's Tenosynovitis, which is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. This condition is common in individuals who perform repetitive hand or wrist movements, such as lifting a child. The key physical examination finding that supports this diagnosis is pain elicited by the Finkelstein test, which involves grasping the thumb and applying ulnar deviation to the wrist. This action stretches the tendons of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist and causes pain in patients with De Quervain's Tenosynovitis. The patient's history of falling on an outstretched hand could have caused strain or injury to these tendons, initiating the inflammatory process.",Answer: De Quervain's Tenosynovitis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of De Quervain's tenosynovitis in a general population is about 0.5%. Given that the pain is localized to the radial side of the wrist and is exacerbated by certain wrist movements such as lifting (as when holding her infant son), this can increase the posterior probability to 10%. The history of falling on an outstretched hand, a common cause of strain in the area of the thumb and wrist, could increase the posterior probability to 25%. Furthermore, the positive Finkelstein's test (pain upon grasping the thumb and exerting longitudinal traction towards the ulnar side) significantly increases the likelihood of De Quervain's tenosynovitis to perhaps 60%. Finally, her mother's rheumatological condition might be thought to increase the likelihood of a rheumatological condition in the patient, but the absence of swelling, redness, or tenderness of any other joints makes this less likely, leaving De Quervain's tenosynovitis as the most probable diagnosis",Answer: De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Y
"A 38-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of epigastric pain and multiple episodes of vomiting for 4 hours. Initially, the vomit was yellowish in color, but after the first couple of episodes it was streaked with blood. He had 2 episodes of vomiting that contained streaks of frank blood on the way to the hospital. He has been hospitalized twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. He drinks 2 pints of vodka daily but had over 4 pints during the past 12 hours. He takes naproxen for his 'hangovers.' He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37°C (99.1°F), pulse is 105/min, and blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes and a tremor of his hands. The abdomen is soft and shows tenderness to palpation in the epigastric region; there is no organomegaly. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.3 g/dL and hematocrit concentration is 40%. What is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",Mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction,Mallory-Weiss Syndrome,Y,Acute pancreatitis,N,Alcohol-induced gastritis,N,Acute pancreatitis,N,Alcoholic pancreatitis,N,,"Rationale: This patient has a history of heavy alcohol intake and acute pancreatitis, both of which can contribute to upper gastrointestinal bleeding. His episodes of vomiting initially were yellowish (which might suggest bile), but later became streaked with blood and even contained frank blood. This indicates that there's bleeding somewhere in his upper gastrointestinal tract. Given his history of alcohol abuse and acute pancreatitis, he is at risk for several conditions that can cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding, including esophageal varices, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, peptic ulcer disease, and gastritis. However, the use of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), adds an additional risk factor for peptic ulcer disease, which is a common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Therefore, given the combination of alcohol abuse, history of pancreatitis, and NSAID use, peptic ulcer disease is the most likely cause of this patient's vomiting blood.",Answer: Peptic ulcer disease.,N,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes acute pancreatitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, and Boerhaave syndrome. The patient has a history of chronic alcohol use and acute pancreatitis, both of which can be associated with all these conditions. The presence of streaks of frank blood in the vomitus indicates some form of gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the nature of this bleeding (initially streaked, then frank blood) and the acute onset of symptoms after a bout of vomiting point more towards a condition associated with forceful vomiting, like a Mallory-Weiss tear or Boerhaave syndrome. Boerhaave syndrome, a rupture of the esophagus, would likely present with more severe symptoms such as intense chest pain, shortness of breath, and signs of shock, which this patient lacks. Therefore, considering his alcohol use, the nature of the vomiting and bleeding, and his symptom presentation, a Mallory-Weiss tear, which is a tear in the mucosa at the gastroesophageal junction caused by forceful vomiting, seems most likely.",Answer: Mallory-Weiss tear,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes acute pancreatitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, Mallory-Weiss tear, and Boerhaave syndrome.

The use of naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), further increases the risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastrointestinal bleeding. Alcohol can also directly injure the gastric mucosa and precipitate peptic ulcers. Furthermore, chronic alcohol consumption can lead to liver cirrhosis, and consequently to portal hypertension and esophageal varices, another possible source of upper GI bleeding. However, the absence of organomegaly (indicating no evidence of liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension on physical examination) and normal hemoglobin/hematocrit makes esophageal varices less likely. Therefore, the most likely cause of his findings is a bleeding peptic ulcer.",Answer: Bleeding Peptic Ulcer,N,"The prior probability of acute pancreatitis in this patient, given his frequent heavy alcohol use and previous hospitalizations for the same condition, is around 70%. The presence of epigastric pain, a classic symptom of acute pancreatitis, increases the posterior probability to around 85%. His vomiting streaked with blood suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is often seen in severe cases of acute pancreatitis, and elevates the probability to 90%. His high pulse rate might indicate pain and anxiety associated with pancreatitis, pushing the probability to about 95%. Lastly, the tremor in his hands could be indicative of alcohol withdrawal, which doesn't necessarily influence the diagnosis of pancreatitis, but does corroborate his heavy alcohol use, a major risk factor for recurrent acute pancreatitis.",Answer: Acute pancreatitis.,N
"A 28-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of intermittent stomach pain, non-bloody diarrhea, and weight loss for the last 3 months. He has occasional abdominal pain and fever. This condition makes studying difficult. He has tried omeprazole and dietary changes with no improvement. Past medical history is significant for occasional pain in the wrists and knees for several years. He takes ibuprofen for pain relief. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). On mental status examination, short-term memory is impaired. Attention and concentration are reduced. Examination shows no abnormalities or tenderness of the wrists or knees. There are no abnormalities on heart and lung examinations. Abdominal examination is normal. Upper endoscopy shows normal stomach mucosa but in the duodenum, there is pale yellow mucosa with erythema and ulcerations. Biopsies show infiltration of the lamina propria with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages. What best explains these findings?",Whipple s disease,Whipple's disease,Y,Crohn's disease,N,Crohn's disease,N,Crohn's disease,N,Whipple's Disease,Y,,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms include gastrointestinal issues (intermittent stomach pain, non-bloody diarrhea, weight loss), occasional abdominal pain and fever, as well as memory impairment and reduced attention/concentration. Additionally, he has occasional pain in his wrists and knees. These symptoms, when taken together with the histological findings from the biopsy of the duodenum (pale yellow mucosa with erythema and ulcerations, infiltration of the lamina propria with PAS-positive macrophages), suggest that the patient is suffering from Whipple's disease. Whipple's disease is a rare systemic illness caused by infection with the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. It predominantly affects the small intestine, leading to malabsorption, but can also impact other systems, including the central nervous system (which might explain his mental status changes) and joints.",Answer: Whipple's disease.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes a range of conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis), peptic ulcer disease, celiac disease, and gastrointestinal infections. However, he doesn't respond to dietary changes, making celiac disease less likely. His normal stomach mucosa found during upper endoscopy also makes peptic ulcer disease less likely. He has not been mentioned to have any travel history or exposures, which makes infection less likely. The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever, combined with duodenal ulcerations and the presence of PAS-positive macrophages, are indicative of Crohn's disease. This is further supported by his intermittent joint pain (Crohn's can be associated with extra-intestinal symptoms like arthritis). The memory impairment and reduced attention and concentration could be secondary to malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies caused by the disease.",Answer: Crohn's disease,N,"Rationale: The patient presents with intermittent stomach pain, non-bloody diarrhea, weight loss, occasional abdominal pain, and fever for the last 3 months. His past medical history of occasional joint pain and the new finding of impaired memory, attention, and concentration are also significant. The upper endoscopy showed pale yellow mucosa with erythema and ulcerations in the duodenum, and biopsies revealed infiltration of the lamina propria with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages. These findings are indicative of Whipple's disease, a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei. This disease primarily affects the small intestine but can also affect other systems including the joints and the central nervous system (which explains his joint pain and cognitive symptoms). The PAS-positive macrophages are characteristic of this disease as they contain the causative bacteria.",Answer: Whipple's disease,Y,"Rationale: The 28-year-old man has presented with intermittent stomach pain, non-bloody diarrhea, weight loss, occasional abdominal pain, fever, and impaired short-term memory. Additionally, he has a history of occasional pain in the wrists and knees. The upper endoscopy revealed pale yellow mucosa with erythema and ulcerations in the duodenum, and biopsies showed infiltration of the lamina propria with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages. These findings are consistent with Whipple's disease, a rare bacterial infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei. This infection affects the lining of the small intestine and can also involve other organs such as the joints, heart, and brain. The PAS-positive macrophages in the lamina propria are characteristic of Whipple's disease, as the PAS stain highlights the accumulated bacterial fragments within the macrophages. The joint pains and cognitive impairment can also be attributed to the systemic nature of the disease.",Answer: Whipple's disease,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of this patient having Whipple's disease is relatively low in the general population, let's assume at 0.1%. The symptoms of intermittent stomach pain, non-bloody diarrhea, and weight loss increase the probability of some sort of gastrointestinal disorder. The patient also has joint pain and fever which is consistent with Whipple's disease, increasing the probability to around 2%. The finding of pale yellow mucosa with erythema and ulcerations in the duodenum, further increases the probability to 10%. Finally, the biopsy showing infiltration of the lamina propria with PAS-positive macrophages is characteristic of Whipple's disease, raising the probability to around 90%. Given these findings and the clinical picture, Whipple's disease is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Whipple's disease,Y
"A 44-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with confusion starting this morning. Her husband states that she initially complained of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue after eating. She has vomited 3 times and progressively became more confused. Her past medical history is notable for morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, a sleeve gastrectomy 1 month ago, and depression with multiple suicide attempts. Her temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 104/54 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her physical exam is notable for generalized confusion. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Dumping syndrome,Hyponatremia,N,SIADH.,N,Hypoglycemia,N,Hypoglycemia,N,Hyponatremia,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 44-year-old woman who presented with confusion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue following eating, and has a history of morbid obesity, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleeve gastrectomy, and depression. A critical finding in this case is her low blood glucose level of 41 mg/dL, which is significantly below the normal range (70-100 mg/dL) and can explain her symptoms of confusion, fatigue, and abdominal pain, as these are symptoms of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, since she has undergone sleeve gastrectomy one month ago, she is at risk for post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia, which occurs due to an exaggerated insulin response to food intake.",Answer: Post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes hypoglycemia, sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis, post-surgical complications, electrolyte abnormalities, or psychiatric conditions such as a drug overdose. Notably, the patient�s glucose is 41 mg/dL, which is critically low and could explain her confusion, abdominal pain, vomiting, and tachycardia. The symptoms began after eating, which could be due to an exaggerated insulin response postprandially. She also has a history of a recent sleeve gastrectomy, which makes dumping syndrome a consideration. However, the severely low glucose level is the most critical abnormality and is highly consistent with her presentation. Since C-peptide levels are normal, this makes exogenous insulin administration or an insulinoma unlikely, thus pointing to hypoglycemia as the most likely cause, which could be reactive hypoglycemia exacerbated by the recent surgery.",Answer: Hypoglycemia,N,"Rationale: This 44-year-old woman presents with confusion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and vomiting following a meal. The most striking laboratory abnormality is her low blood glucose level of 41 mg/dL. She has recently undergone a sleeve gastrectomy, which is a surgery known to rapidly empty stomach contents into the small intestine. This rapid emptying, known as ""dumping syndrome,"" can lead to a reactive hypoglycemia as a large amount of insulin is released in response to the rapid increase in blood glucose from the ingested food. Her past medical history of morbid obesity and recent sleeve gastrectomy, along with her presentation of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and hypoglycemia after eating, are highly suggestive of dumping syndrome.",Answer: Dumping Syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with confusion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue after eating, as well as hypoglycemia (glucose of 41 mg/dL). Given that she had undergone a sleeve gastrectomy one month ago, it is important to consider complications related to the surgery. One such complication is dumping syndrome. Dumping syndrome occurs when the contents of the stomach are rapidly ""dumped"" into the small intestine. This rapid dumping causes fluid to be pulled into the intestines, leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea. Moreover, the rapid absorption of glucose can cause an initial spike in blood sugar levels, followed by reactive hypoglycemia as the body secretes insulin in response. This reactive hypoglycemia is consistent with the patient's low blood glucose levels. The patient's normal C-peptide level suggests that her hypoglycemia is not due to an insulinoma or exogenous insulin, and her symptoms starting after eating further support the diagnosis of dumping syndrome.",Answer: Dumping syndrome,Y,"Rationale: The patient is a 44-year-old woman who recently underwent a sleeve gastrectomy and presents with confusion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, and hypoglycemia (glucose: 41 mg/dL). Given her recent history of sleeve gastrectomy, the symptoms could be attributed to rapid gastric emptying, known as dumping syndrome. Dumping syndrome occurs when food, especially sugar, moves from the stomach into the small bowel too quickly. This rapid movement is due to the altered anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract after bariatric surgery. The sudden dumping of food into the small intestine causes the body to move fluid into the gut, leading to diarrhea and abdominal pain. Additionally, rapid absorption of glucose leads to an exaggerated insulin release, resulting in hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, fatigue, and in severe cases, loss of consciousness. The fact that her symptoms began after eating and that she has severe hypoglycemia in the setting of recent bariatric surgery strongly suggests dumping syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Dumping syndrome,Y
"A 3-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of a rash on his scalp and forehead. The parents report that the rash has been present for several weeks. They state that the rash is sometimes red and scaly, especially when it is cold. The patient was born at 36 weeks' gestation and has generally been healthy since. His father has psoriasis. The patient appears comfortable. Examination shows several erythematous patches on the scalp, forehead, and along the hairline. Some patches are covered by greasy yellow scales.

The fact that the rash has been present for several weeks and gets red and scaly when it's cold suggests that this is a chronic condition. Since the patient was generally healthy and has a family history of psoriasis (father with psoriasis), it is important to consider a skin condition. However, psoriasis is less common in this age group. The presentation of erythematous patches with greasy yellow scales is highly suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis, which is common in infants and usually appears within the first 3 months of life. It can affect the scalp, where it is known as �cradle cap�.",Answer: Seborrheic Dermatitis,Y,"Rationale: For the 3-month-old boy with a rash on his scalp and forehead, the differential diagnosis includes seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, tinea capitis, and contact dermatitis. The fact that the rash has been present for several weeks and is described as red and scaly, especially when it is cold, gives us some clues. Psoriasis is a possibility, especially considering the family history, but it's relatively rare in infants. Atopic dermatitis usually presents with itching and discomfort, which is not reported in this case. Tinea capitis is usually associated with hair loss in the affected areas, which is also not mentioned. Contact dermatitis would typically be more acute in presentation. Seborrheic dermatitis, also known as cradle cap in infants, is common and usually presents with erythematous patches covered by greasy yellow scales, especially on the scalp, forehead, and along the hairline, which aligns with the description given.",Answer: Seborrheic Dermatitis,Y,"Rationale: This 3-month-old boy has presented with a rash on his scalp and forehead which is erythematous (red) and scaly, with greasy yellow scales. These clinical features are consistent with seborrheic dermatitis, which is common in infants. The fact that the rash is prominent on the scalp and along the hairline also points towards seborrheic dermatitis, which often affects these areas. Additionally, the presence of greasy yellow scales is characteristic of this condition. While it's worth noting that the father has psoriasis, which can sometimes be confused with seborrheic dermatitis due to the presence of scaly patches, the distribution and description of the scales in this case are more indicative of seborrheic dermatitis.",Answer: Seborrheic dermatitis,Y,"Rationale: The 3-month-old boy presents with a rash on his scalp and forehead which is red and scaly. The presence of erythematous patches covered by greasy yellow scales is characteristic of seborrheic dermatitis. Infants are known to be susceptible to this condition, especially within the first three months of life. Seborrheic dermatitis can be more severe in infants born prematurely, as this patient was born at 36 weeks' gestation. It is a common and benign condition that typically resolves on its own over time. The fact that the patient is comfortable and appears not to be in distress supports this benign diagnosis. The family history of psoriasis does not significantly contribute to this diagnosis, as psoriasis typically does not present in this manner or at this age.",Answer: Seborrheic dermatitis,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of seborrheic dermatitis in infants is about 10%. Considering the age of the infant being 3-months-old, the likelihood of seborrheic dermatitis increases to around 25%. The presence of erythematous patches and greasy yellow scales, which are characteristic of seborrheic dermatitis, increases the probability further to around 50%. Given the chronicity of the rash as reported by the parents, and the fact that it worsens in cold weather, the probability increases to 75%. Additionally, the fact that the infant seems comfortable indicates that the rash is not causing significant discomfort, which is consistent with seborrheic dermatitis. With all these factors considered, the likelihood of the rash being seborrheic dermatitis is very high.",Answer: Seborrheic dermatitis,Y
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department with dizziness. He states he has experienced a sustained sensation of the room spinning that is low grade and constant since this morning. The patient occasionally feels nauseous and has been taking diphenydramine to sleep which helps with his symptoms. The patient is generally healthy, has no other medical conditions, and only endorses eating more garlic recently to get over a cold he had a few days ago. His temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 122/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a healthy man. The patient is sat upright, his head is turned slightly to the right, and he is laid back flat rapidly. This does not provoke any symptoms even when repeated on the left side. A nystagmus is notable on cranial nerve exam as well as bilateral decreased hearing. The patient’s tandem gait is unstable; however, his baseline gait appears unremarkable despite the patient stating he has a sustained sensation of imbalance. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Labyrinthitis,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV),N,BPPV,N,BPPV,N,Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.,N,BPPV,N,,"Rationale: The 27-year-old man presents with dizziness, a sensation of the room spinning, nausea, and has been using diphenhydramine for sleep. The mention of a constant low-grade sensation of spinning suggests a vestibular issue. Additionally, the physical examination is notable for nystagmus and bilateral decreased hearing, along with an unstable tandem gait, though his baseline gait is unremarkable. These findings strongly suggest a problem in the inner ear or the vestibular system. The presence of nystagmus, decreased hearing, and dizziness are characteristic of Meniere's disease, which is a disorder of the inner ear causing vertigo, ringing in the ear, and hearing problems.",Answer: Meniere's disease,N,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Meniere's disease, vestibular neuritis, labyrinthitis, medication side effect, and vestibular migraine. BPPV usually presents with short episodes of dizziness triggered by changes in head position, and the patient's sustained dizziness and lack of response to the Dix-Hallpike maneuver make BPPV less likely. Vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis usually follow a viral infection and are associated with a sudden onset of severe dizziness, which doesn't match the patient's low-grade symptoms. Medication side effect could be a possibility since diphenhydramine can cause dizziness, but it doesn't fully explain the hearing loss. Vestibular migraine usually presents with recurrent episodes of vertigo, which isn't the case here. Meniere's disease, on the other hand, presents with episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus, and can be associated with a feeling of fullness in the ear. The patient's constant sensation of the room spinning, decreased bilateral hearing, and nystagmus make Meniere's disease the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Meniere's disease,N,"Rationale: The 27-year-old man presenting with a sustained sensation of the room spinning, nausea, bilateral decreased hearing, and nystagmus, is indicative of an inner ear problem. The dizziness described as a sensation of room spinning (vertigo) and the nystagmus suggest that the vestibular system is involved. The fact that this is accompanied by bilateral decreased hearing suggests involvement of the auditory system as well. These symptoms collectively are consistent with M�ni�re's disease, which is characterized by episodes of vertigo, ringing in the ear, and hearing loss. M�ni�re's disease is an inner ear disorder thought to be caused by a buildup of fluid in the inner ear.",Answer: M�ni�re's disease,N,"Rationale: The 27-year-old man presenting with a sustained sensation of room spinning, nausea, nystagmus, bilateral decreased hearing, and an unsteady tandem gait indicates a disorder affecting the inner ear. The inner ear is responsible for balance and hearing. The symptoms he is experiencing, especially the dizziness and unsteadiness, can be attributed to the dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. The bilateral decreased hearing points towards an issue affecting both ears, and as the dizziness is constant, this is more likely to be a bilateral condition affecting the inner ear rather than a benign paroxysmal positional vertigo which is usually triggered by movements. Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that is known to cause a sensation of spinning (vertigo), hearing loss, and tinnitus. It generally affects both ears over time and is characterized by episodes of vertigo and hearing changes. The recent cold the patient had may have contributed to inner ear changes leading to the symptoms.",Answer: Meniere's Disease,N,Answer: M�ni�re's disease,Answer: M�ni�re's disease,N
"Three days after undergoing coronary bypass surgery, a 67-year-old man becomes unresponsive and hypotensive. He is intubated, mechanically ventilated, and a central line is inserted. Vasopressin and noradrenaline infusions are begun. A Foley catheter is placed. Six days later, he has high unrelenting fevers. He is currently receiving noradrenaline via an infusion pump. His temperature is 39.6° (102.3°F), pulse is 113/min, and blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg. Examination shows a sternal wound with surrounding erythema; there is no discharge from the wound. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. A Foley catheter is present. His hemoglobin concentration is 10.8 g/dL, leukocyte count is 21,700/mm3, and platelet count is 165,000/mm3. Samples for blood culture are drawn simultaneously from the central line and peripheral IV line. Blood cultures from the central line show coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on the 8th postoperative day, and those from the peripheral venous line show coagulase-negative cocci in clusters on the 10th postoperative day. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Central line associated blood stream infection,Sternal wound infection,N,Sternal wound infection.,N,Sternal wound infection,N,Sepsis,N,Sternal wound infection,N,,"Rationale: This 67-year-old patient had coronary bypass surgery and subsequently became unresponsive and hypotensive. He was put on mechanical ventilation, and a central line was inserted. Six days later, he developed high fevers. The patient's clinical presentation including fever, hypotension, and the positive blood cultures showing coagulase-negative cocci in clusters indicate a likely bloodstream infection. Notably, the blood cultures from the central line turned positive earlier than those from the peripheral line. This suggests that the infection is originating from the central line, which is consistent with central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). Coagulase-negative staphylococci are common causes of CLABSI.",Answer: Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection,Y,"Rationale: In this patient who underwent coronary bypass surgery and subsequently became unresponsive and hypotensive, the differential diagnosis includes sepsis, pneumonia, wound infection, endocarditis, and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). The patient�s high fevers, hypotension, and leukocytosis suggest a systemic infection. His recent surgery and central line placement make him particularly susceptible to infections. The presence of erythema around the sternal wound raises the possibility of wound infection, but there is no discharge noted. Crackles in the lungs could suggest pneumonia but the most striking evidence here is the blood cultures showing coagulase-negative cocci in clusters from both central line and peripheral line, which is indicative of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common cause of central line-associated bloodstream infections. The fact that the bacteria was detected earlier from the central line compared to the peripheral line suggests that the infection source is more likely to be the central line.",Answer: Central line-associated bloodstream infection,Y,"Rationale: This patient had undergone coronary bypass surgery and subsequently presented with high unrelenting fevers, hypotension, and evidence of systemic inflammation as indicated by elevated leukocyte count. He has a central line in place, and blood cultures drawn from the central line showed growth of coagulase-negative cocci in clusters earlier than cultures drawn from a peripheral IV line. The combination of systemic inflammatory signs, presence of a central line, and the blood culture results suggest that this patient has a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococci, which are common skin flora and known to cause infections associated with intravascular devices.",Answer: Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection,Y,"Rationale: The patient in this scenario has undergone a coronary bypass surgery and later developed high, unrelenting fevers, along with hypotension. The presence of crackles at both lung bases indicates possible infection or fluid overload. The blood culture results showing coagulase-negative cocci in clusters are indicative of Staphylococcus epidermidis infection, which is known to cause central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The fact that these bacteria were detected earlier in the central line than in the peripheral line indicates that the infection source is likely the central line. Additionally, this patient is critically ill and has been in an intensive care setting, which increases the risk for hospital-acquired infections, particularly central line-associated bloodstream infections.",Answer: Central line-associated bloodstream infection,Y,"Rationale: Initially, let's consider the prior probability of a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in patients who have undergone coronary bypass surgery and have a central line inserted. The prior probability is 5%. However, this patient has high fevers, which are commonly associated with infections, increasing the posterior probability of CLABSI to 20%. Additionally, he has a leukocyte count of 21,700/mm3, which indicates an immune response to infection, further raising the posterior probability to 40%. Moreover, the presence of coagulase-negative cocci in clusters from blood cultures drawn from the central line and later from the peripheral line are indicative of a bloodstream infection, this raises the probability to 80%. Furthermore, the erythema around the sternal wound indicates local inflammation but no discharge from the wound, which suggests that the infection is likely systemic and related to the central line rather than the surgical site. This increases the probability of CLABSI to 95%. Given this information and the patient�s clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a central line-associated bloodstream infection.",Answer: Central line-associated bloodstream infection,Y
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the physician because of inappropriate behavior for the past 6 months. He has been making inappropriate comments and jokes while talking to friends and family members. He was arrested 3 weeks ago while trying to kiss strangers on the street. He has no interest in talking to his daughter or playing with his grandchildren. During this period, he has developed a strong desire for chocolate pudding and potato chips and has gained 10 kg (22 lb). He appears unkempt. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Mental status examination shows apathy and a blunt affect. He avoids answering questions and instead comments on the individuals he saw in the waiting room. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 28/30. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, creatine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Frontotemporal dementia,Major depressive disorder,N,Depression,N,Bipolar disorder,N,Bipolar disorder,N,Dementia,N,,"Rationale: This patient is showing a change in personality and social behavior. His inappropriate comments, loss of interest in socializing with family, and development of new and unusual habits such as an unusual desire for specific foods and engaging in inappropriate physical contact with strangers are indicative of behavioral changes. His vital signs are normal and his Mini-Mental State Examination score is relatively high, which means that his cognitive function is largely intact. His blood tests are also within normal ranges. These behavioral changes, in the context of preserved cognition, are characteristic of a frontal lobe syndrome. Specifically, this is suggestive of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), which is a neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain and leads to changes in personality, behavior, and language.",Answer: Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes frontotemporal dementia, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurological or psychiatric conditions. The symptoms of making inappropriate comments, lack of interest in social interaction, apathy, and a change in eating habits, particularly a strong preference for specific types of foods, are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia. This condition usually affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, which are responsible for behavior, personality, and language. Major depressive disorder would usually present with sadness and may not manifest with inappropriate social behavior. Schizophrenia may present with disorganized behavior but is less likely given the age of onset and the specific behavioral changes mentioned. Alzheimer's disease usually presents with memory loss as the most prominent symptom. The fact that his Mini-Mental State Examination score is 28/30 suggests that cognitive decline is not prominent, which makes Alzheimer's less likely. His age and specific pattern of behavior changes, including socially inappropriate actions, changes in dietary preferences, and apathy, make frontotemporal dementia the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Frontotemporal dementia,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gastrointestinal infection, and Whipple's disease.

Celiac disease often presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, but it's unlikely in this case because biopsy results typically show villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis in the small intestine, which is not noted here.

IBD, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, could cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and even joint pain. However, it would likely not result in periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages on biopsy.

IBS might present with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, but it usually does not cause weight loss, fever, or abnormal histological findings.

Gastrointestinal infection could explain some of his symptoms, but the chronicity of his symptoms and the specific biopsy findings argue against it.

Whipple's disease, a rare condition caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei, presents with a classic triad of arthralgia, weight loss, and diarrhea. It may also affect the central nervous system, causing symptoms like memory loss and reduced concentration, as seen in this patient. It is diagnosed by the presence of PAS-positive macrophages on biopsy, as noted in this patient's case.

So, based on the patient's symptoms, their chronicity, the presence of the classic triad of symptoms, and the biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Whipple's disease.",Answer: Whipple's disease.,N,"Rationale: This patient presents with personality and behavioral changes including inappropriate social behavior and changes in eating habits, suggesting a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the frontal and temporal lobes. The lack of cognitive impairment on Mini-Mental State Examination rules out most dementias, like Alzheimer's. The constellation of symptoms such as disinhibition (making inappropriate comments, trying to kiss strangers), apathy and blunted affect, compulsive or ritualistic behavior (strong desire for specific foods leading to weight gain), and lack of insight (unkempt appearance) are indicative of Frontotemporal Dementia, specifically the behavioral variant. The normal blood tests make metabolic causes of behavioral changes less likely.",Answer: Frontotemporal Dementia,Y,"The prior probability of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is relatively low in the general population, let's estimate it as 1% for the sake of argument. The patient shows socially inappropriate behavior, a symptom consistent with FTD, increasing the posterior probability to perhaps 15%. Furthermore, the fact that he displays apathy and blunted affect, which are also signs of FTD, could raise the posterior probability to 30%. The lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities, in this case, interaction with his daughter and grandchildren, further supports the diagnosis and might elevate the probability to 50%. The patient's new and unusual food preferences, as well as a significant weight gain, are also often seen in FTD, which could push the probability to 70%. Additionally, the patient�s good score on the Mini-Mental State Examination and his normal lab results can make other forms of dementia less likely, again boosting the likelihood of FTD. This patient's signs and symptoms, therefore, most likely indicate frontotemporal dementia.",Answer: Frontotemporal dementia.,Y
A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of loss of urine for the last several months. She loses small amounts of urine without warning after coughing or sneezing. She also sometimes forgets the names of her relatives. She is retired and lives at an assisted-living facility. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her older sister recently received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Medications include metformin and enalapril. Vital signs are within normal limits. She walks without any problems. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is normal. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?,Urethral hypermobility,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,N,Neurogenic bladder,N,Urinary incontinence,N,Stress urinary incontinence,Y,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,N,,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of loss of urine after coughing or sneezing is a classical symptom of stress incontinence. Stress incontinence is common in older women and is often due to a decrease in the strength of the pelvic floor muscles, which can occur due to age, childbirth, or menopause. This patient's forgetfulness may be a sign of age-related cognitive decline, or could potentially indicate the early stages of a dementia syndrome, although more information would be needed to make this determination. The fact that her older sister recently received a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is likely unrelated to this patient's urinary symptoms, as these shunts are typically used to treat conditions like hydrocephalus, not incontinence.",Answer: Stress incontinence,Y,"Rationale: The symptoms described - losing small amounts of urine without warning when coughing or sneezing - are characteristic of stress urinary incontinence. This condition is common in older women and can be due to the weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. Factors that may contribute to this include age, childbirth, surgery, and obesity. With regard to her forgetting the names of her relatives, this could be due to various reasons including age-related memory loss, early stages of dementia, or other cognitive impairment conditions. It should be noted that her diabetes and hypertension, if not well-controlled, can contribute to cognitive decline. However, without more detailed information on the nature and progression of her memory problems, it's difficult to provide a precise diagnosis related to this symptom. The two symptoms aren't usually related and might be coincidental.",Answer: Stress urinary incontinence,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms of losing small amounts of urine without warning after coughing or sneezing suggest a condition called stress urinary incontinence. This condition often occurs in older women, particularly those who have given birth vaginally, as their pelvic floor muscles may be weakened and thus fail to support the bladder adequately. The urinary sphincter, which controls the release of urine, also weakens with age. Coughing, sneezing, or even laughing can cause an increase in intra-abdominal pressure, leading to involuntary leakage of urine. Moreover, her forgetting the names of her relatives could be an indication of mild cognitive impairment, which is common in elderly people and can be exacerbated by conditions like diabetes, as seen in this patient. However, these memory issues aren't directly related to her urinary symptoms.",Answer: Stress Urinary Incontinence.,Y,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with stress incontinence, which is common in older women due to weakening of the pelvic floor muscles over time. The key symptom here is the loss of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as coughing or sneezing. Additionally, the forgetfulness could be due to age-related cognitive decline, although it's important to rule out other causes. It's worth noting that there is no clear connection between these two symptoms - stress incontinence and forgetfulness - in this case. Both are not uncommon in elderly patients, but they are generally unrelated and could be coincidental.",Answer: Weakened pelvic floor muscles,Y,"Rationale: The given information suggests that this patient is experiencing stress incontinence, a condition often related to age and weakened pelvic muscles. The Bayesian reasoning would proceed as follows:

The prior probability of stress incontinence in women over 70 is approximately 30%. The symptom of urine loss after coughing or sneezing increases this probability to 60%, as this is a characteristic sign of stress incontinence. No other symptoms or factors are given that significantly affect this probability. The mention of the patient's forgetfulness could imply some cognitive decline, but it is not directly related to the incontinence issue and doesn't change the probability significantly. Therefore, the posterior probability of the cause of this patient's symptoms being stress incontinence is approximately 60%.",Answer: Stress incontinence.,Y
"A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-week history of productive cough, swelling of the legs and feet, and fatigue. He has had progressive dyspnea on exertion for the past 2 months. Twelve years ago, he received a porcine valve replacement for severe mitral valve regurgitation. He has coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years and drinks one beer daily. Current medications include aspirin, simvastatin, ramipril, metoprolol, metformin, and hydrochlorothiazide. He appears pale. He is 179 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 127 kg (279.9 lb); BMI is 41.3 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), respirations are 22/min, pulse is 96/min, and blood pressure is 146/94 mm Hg. Bilateral basilar rales are heard on auscultation of the lungs. Cardiac examination shows a laterally displaced apical heartbeat. A grade 3/6, decrescendo-crescendo diastolic murmur is heard over the apex. There is bilateral pitting edema of the feet and ankles. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Valve degeneration,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive heart failure,N,,"Rationale: This patient presents with a productive cough, fatigue, swelling of the legs and feet, progressive dyspnea, and a laterally displaced apical heartbeat, all indicative of heart failure symptoms. Additionally, he has a history of mitral valve replacement, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, all of which can contribute to the development of heart failure.

The patient has a diastolic murmur over the apex and bilateral basilar rales on lung auscultation, which suggest the presence of valvular heart disease and possible fluid accumulation in the lungs, further supporting the heart failure diagnosis.

Given the history of porcine valve replacement and the current diastolic murmur, it is highly likely that this patient is suffering from prosthetic valve dysfunction, potentially in the form of prosthetic valve stenosis or regurgitation. This can occur due to mechanical failure, thrombosis, or infection, leading to increased cardiac workload and subsequently heart failure symptoms.",Answer: Prosthetic valve dysfunction.,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes congestive heart failure (CHF), pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and infective endocarditis. The key clinical features to note are the patient's productive cough, bilateral basilar rales, laterally displaced apical heartbeat, a diastolic murmur over the apex, and bilateral pitting edema of the feet and ankles.

Given his history of a porcine valve replacement, we must consider valve dysfunction or infection. However, he does not have any signs of infection such as fever or other systemic symptoms, which makes infective endocarditis less likely.

His history of smoking and symptoms of productive cough and dyspnea could point towards COPD or pneumonia, but the presence of a diastolic murmur and peripheral edema is less typical for these conditions.

The laterally displaced apical beat, grade 3/6 decrescendo-crescendo diastolic murmur at the apex, and bilateral pitting edema are signs of heart failure. This can be due to his mitral valve prosthesis dysfunction (as evidenced by the murmur) leading to fluid buildup (rales, peripheral edema). Additionally, his obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease are all risk factors for CHF.

In conclusion, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is congestive heart failure due to dysfunction of the mitral valve prosthesis.",Answer: Congestive Heart Failure,N,"Rationale: The symptoms presented by this patient, including a productive cough, swelling of the legs and feet (bilateral pitting edema), fatigue, and progressive dyspnea on exertion, suggest a diagnosis related to heart failure. His history of coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, as well as his lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol use, and obesity) contribute to his risk for cardiovascular disease. The presence of a decrescendo-crescendo diastolic murmur over the apex, a sign of aortic insufficiency, further supports the hypothesis of a valvular issue. Additionally, given his history of porcine valve replacement for severe mitral valve regurgitation 12 years ago, it's plausible that the bioprosthetic valve has degenerated over time leading to either stenosis or regurgitation, which can lead to the congestive heart failure symptoms he is experiencing. The laterally displaced apical heartbeat and bilateral basilar rales (a sign of fluid accumulation in the lungs due to poor heart function) are also indicative of heart failure.",Answer: Bioprosthetic Valve Degeneration,Y,"Rationale: This patient has a history of mitral valve replacement, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. Furthermore, he has a long history of smoking and an elevated BMI, which are risk factors for heart disease. The dyspnea on exertion, bilateral basilar rales, displaced apical heartbeat, and a decrescendo-crescendo diastolic murmur over the apex are suggestive of a cardiac pathology, most likely related to the mitral valve. The pitting edema of the feet and ankles are indicative of fluid overload, commonly seen in heart failure. This patient likely has prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction or failure leading to congestive heart failure.",Answer: Prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of prosthetic valve dysfunction in a patient with a history of porcine valve replacement is 5%. However, the symptoms of the patient such as progressive dyspnea on exertion, productive cough, and bilateral basilar rales, indicative of heart failure, increase the posterior probability of prosthetic valve dysfunction to 15%. The presence of a laterally displaced apical heartbeat and a diastolic murmur over the apex, both consistent with mitral valve dysfunction, further increase the posterior probability to 30%. The significant pitting edema in the lower extremities, suggesting systemic congestion due to left-sided heart failure, pushes the probability even higher to 50%. In addition, the patient's history of heavy smoking, hypertension, and coronary artery disease increase the likelihood of valvular dysfunction due to compromised cardiac health. This patient most likely has prosthetic mitral valve dysfunction.",Answer: Prosthetic Mitral Valve Dysfunction,Y
"Three days after delivery, a 1100-g (2-lb 7-oz) newborn has a tonic seizure that lasts for 25 seconds. She has become increasingly lethargic over the past 18 hours. She was born at 31 weeks' gestation. Antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis. Apgar scores were 3 and 6 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. She appears ill. Her pulse is 123/min, respirations are 50/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. Examination shows a tense anterior fontanelle. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Examination shows slow, conjugate back and forth movements of the eyes. Muscle tone is decreased in all extremities. The lungs are clear to auscultation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Intraventricular hemorrhage,Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,N,Sepsis,N,Sepsis,N,Hypoglycemia,N,Meningitis,N,,"Rationale: This preterm neonate is presenting with a tonic seizure, lethargy, tense anterior fontanelle, sluggish pupil reactions, irregular respirations, decreased muscle tone in all extremities, and slow, conjugate back and forth movements of the eyes (also known as 'sunsetting sign'). These symptoms together suggest increased intracranial pressure. The antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, which can lead to an intracranial infection in the neonate. The most likely diagnosis is neonatal meningitis.",Answer: Neonatal meningitis,N,"Rationale: The differential for this newborn includes: sepsis, meningitis, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), hypoglycemia, or a metabolic disorder. Sepsis or meningitis could be present due to the history of chorioamnionitis, but the slow, conjugate back and forth movements of the eyes (known as ""sunset"" sign) suggest an increase in intracranial pressure, more commonly seen in IVH. The tense anterior fontanelle also points towards raised intracranial pressure. A metabolic disorder can't be ruled out entirely but the clinical features are more suggestive of an intracranial pathology. Hypoglycemia would typically cause jitteriness or tremors rather than tonic seizures. Given the clinical presentation, gestational age, and history of a low Apgar score, IVH is the most likely diagnosis. IVH is a common complication in premature infants, especially those born before 32 weeks of gestation and with a birth weight of less than 1500 grams.",Answer: Intraventricular hemorrhage,Y,"Rationale: This neonate who was born prematurely and exposed to chorioamnionitis is now presenting with lethargy, a tense anterior fontanelle, slow eye movements, and decreased muscle tone in all extremities. These symptoms are concerning for neonatal meningitis. Neonatal meningitis is often caused by group B streptococcus, Escherichia coli, and other gram-negative rods. The infection can cause meningeal inflammation and increased intracranial pressure, which would account for the tense anterior fontanelle and the slow, conjugate eye movements (likely indicating a setting sun sign, associated with increased intracranial pressure). The decreased muscle tone might be a sign of poor neurological condition, also suggesting a central nervous system infection.",Answer: Neonatal meningitis,N,"Rationale: This preterm newborn presents with tonic seizures, lethargy, irregular respirations, a tense anterior fontanelle, slow eye movements, and decreased muscle tone in all extremities. The antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, an infection of the amniotic fluid and membranes, which can lead to systemic infection in the neonate. The tense anterior fontanelle suggests increased intracranial pressure. The combination of these findings suggests the neonate has developed meningitis, most likely due to a bacterial infection that ascended from the chorioamnionitis. Bacterial meningitis in neonates can cause the signs of central nervous system dysfunction observed in this patient, including seizures, lethargy, and abnormal eye movements.",Answer: Neonatal meningitis,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of neonatal meningitis is around 0.3% in term infants but increases significantly in premature and low birth weight infants, such as the one described. Therefore, we can start by estimating an initial likelihood of 2%. The neonate is showing signs of illness and lethargy, which can be common in cases of neonatal meningitis, this increases the likelihood to 5%. The baby was born prematurely, at 31 weeks, and the antenatal period was complicated by chorioamnionitis, both of which are risk factors for neonatal meningitis, increasing the probability to around 20%. Further, the presence of a tense anterior fontanelle, slow eye movements, decreased muscle tone, and irregular respirations in this context also increases the likelihood of neonatal meningitis to approximately 60%. Given all the clinical findings and history, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal meningitis.",Answer: Neonatal meningitis,N
"A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because of burning pain in his neck and arms for a year. He has also had paresthesias in his hands during this period. He has had increasing weakness in both hands during the past 3 months. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension. He was involved in a motor vehicle collision 3 years ago. Current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, atorvastatin, and aspirin. He has had 7 sexual partners in his lifetime; he uses condoms inconsistently. He is oriented to time, place, and person. Vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination of the upper extremities shows decreased muscle strength, absent reflexes, and decreased hand grip with fasciculations bilaterally. Sensation to temperature and pain is absent over the chest and bilateral upper arms. Vibration and joint position sensations are present in the upper limbs. Cranial nerve examination shows no focal findings. Examination of the lower extremities show no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Syringomyelia,Cervical radiculopathy,N,Peripheral neuropathy,N,Cervical radiculopathy.,N,Brachial plexopathy,N,Cervical radiculopathy,N,,"Rationale: The symptoms presented by this patient are indicative of a chronic and progressive neurological disorder. Given the combination of sensory (paresthesias, loss of pain and temperature sensation) and motor (weakness, decreased hand grip, fasciculations) abnormalities confined to upper extremities, the condition likely involves a part of the spinal cord. Specifically, these symptoms are suggestive of a cervical spinal cord disorder.

In this context, the history of a motor vehicle collision 3 years ago is of particular importance. The patient's symptoms could be a delayed consequence of this accident if it involved any degree of trauma to the cervical spine or spinal cord. The accident could have caused a chronic degenerative condition such as cervical spondylosis, where pressure is placed on the spinal cord and nerves due to wear and tear or damage to the discs or vertebrae of the cervical spine. The fact that the symptoms have progressively worsened over the past year is consistent with this possibility.",Answer: Cervical Spondylosis,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes cervical radiculopathy, cervical spondylotic myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and syringomyelia. Given the chronicity and nature of his symptoms, peripheral neuropathy and radiculopathy are less likely, as they usually present with pain and sensory loss in a specific nerve distribution, not a region spanning multiple dermatomes or levels.

ALS is also less likely due to the lack of lower limb involvement and the specific sensory loss, as ALS primarily affects motor neurons.

Cervical spondylotic myelopathy usually presents with a mix of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs which is not entirely consistent with the case presented.

However, the presence of pain and temperature loss over the chest and upper arms along with preserved proprioception and vibration sensation, as well as motor weakness and atrophy in the upper extremities, is suggestive of a central cord syndrome, often seen in syringomyelia. In syringomyelia, a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) forms within the spinal cord, typically expanding over time, disrupting the crossing spinothalamic tracts mediating pain and temperature sensation, as well as the anterior horn cells leading to weakness and atrophy. This disruption leads to the characteristic ""cape-like"" sensory loss pattern along with muscle weakness seen in this patient.",Answer: Syringomyelia.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of burning pain in his neck and arms, paresthesias in his hands, and progressive weakness, along with a decreased sensation to temperature and pain over the chest and upper arms, while vibration and joint position sensations are intact, are consistent with a condition called syringomyelia. This condition is characterized by the development of a fluid-filled cyst (syrinx) within the spinal cord, and the most common cause of syringomyelia is trauma, like his motor vehicle collision 3 years ago. The characteristic finding in syringomyelia is a ""cape-like"" loss of pain and temperature sensation along the shoulders, arms, and hands with preservation of touch and position sense.",Answer: Syringomyelia,Y,"Rationale: The patient's symptoms - burning pain in the neck and arms, paresthesias, weakness, and absent reflexes in the upper extremities, along with sensory changes - suggest a problem with the cervical spinal cord. More specifically, these findings suggest a condition called syringomyelia, which is a disorder in which a cyst or cavity forms within the spinal cord, often due to trauma (like the car accident the patient had 3 years ago). This cyst can expand and elongate over time, damaging the spinal cord and leading to the symptoms seen in this patient. Syringomyelia typically first affects the nerves that control pain and temperature sensation, which explains the loss of these senses over the chest and upper arms. It also affects motor function leading to weakness, fasciculations, and absent reflexes.",Answer: Syringomyelia.,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a type of motor neuron disease, is relatively low, approximately 0.02%. However, this patient has fasciculations and muscle weakness which increases the probability of ALS to approximately 10%. Further, he also exhibits decreased hand grip strength which increases the probability to 30%. Moreover, decreased reflexes are commonly seen in ALS patients, raising the probability to 60%. Finally, sensory findings of absent temperature and pain sensation over the chest and bilateral upper arms, while not a primary symptom of ALS, may be seen in the disease due to the loss of muscle control and coordination, further raising the probability to about 70%. Given the constellation of these symptoms and absence of other classic signs and symptoms of alternative diagnoses, this patient most likely has Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.",Answer: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.,N
"A 34-year-old man presents to the behavioral health clinic for an evaluation after seeing animal-shaped clouds in the form of dogs, cats, and monkeys. The patient says that these symptoms have been present for more than 2 weeks. Past medical history is significant for simple partial seizures for which he takes valproate, but he has not had his medication adjusted in several years. His vital signs include: blood pressure of 124/76 mm Hg, heart rate of 98/min, respiratory rate of 12/min, and temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented to person, time, and place. Affect is not constricted or flat. Speech is of rapid rate and high volume.

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Illusion,Cocaine-induced psychosis,N,Cocaine-induced psychosis,N,Drug-induced psychosis,N,Substance intoxication,N,Cocaine-induced psychosis,N,,"Rationale: This 34-year-old man presents with visual hallucinations (seeing animal-shaped clouds) and hyperverbal speech (speech of rapid rate and high volume), which are indicative of altered mental status. He tested positive for cocaine and alcohol use on a urine drug screen. Cocaine can cause significant central nervous system stimulation, leading to symptoms such as euphoria, hallucinations, and hyperactivity. Given the positive test for cocaine and the presenting symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is cocaine intoxication.",Answer: Cocaine intoxication,N,"Rationale: This 34-year-old man presents with visual hallucinations (seeing animal-shaped clouds) and hyperverbal speech (speech of rapid rate and high volume), which are indicative of altered mental status. He tested positive for cocaine and alcohol use on a urine drug screen. Cocaine can cause significant central nervous system stimulation, leading to symptoms such as euphoria, hallucinations, and hyperactivity. Given the positive test for cocaine and the presenting symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is cocaine intoxication.",Answer: Cocaine intoxication,N,"Rationale: This patient's symptoms of seeing animals in clouds and rapid, high-volume speech may be suggestive of hallucinations and pressured speech, both of which are common in substance-induced psychotic disorder. He tested positive for cocaine, a stimulant drug that can cause a transient psychotic disorder with hallucinations and delusions. Additionally, the patient's history of simple partial seizures, which can also cause hallucinatory experiences, needs to be taken into consideration. However, his symptoms have been persisting for more than 2 weeks, and it is stated that there were no changes in his seizure medication, making it less likely that his symptoms are related to a seizure disorder. Moreover, his alcohol usage could also contribute to his symptoms but the features are more closely related to cocaine use. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is substance-induced psychotic disorder due to cocaine use.",Answer: Substance-induced psychotic disorder.,N,"Rationale: This patient has a history of seizures which are managed with valproate, a medication that can sometimes cause hallucinations. However, the presence of alcohol and cocaine in the patient's system is of significant importance here. Alcohol and cocaine can both affect brain function and can cause hallucinations. In this case, the patient is seeing animal-shaped clouds. In addition, cocaine use can cause changes in speech, such as a rapid rate and high volume as is seen in this patient. These features, coupled with the evidence of substance use, suggest a substance-induced psychotic disorder.",Answer: Substance-induced psychotic disorder.,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of cocaine-induced hallucinations is around 15-20% given the overall prevalence of such complications among cocaine users. The patient's history of seeing animal-shaped clouds for over 2 weeks increases the probability to around 30%. The fact that the patient's urine drug screen returned positive for cocaine further increases this probability to around 70%. Furthermore, given the patient's symptoms of rapid and high-volume speech, which can be associated with cocaine use, the probability increases to around 85%. Therefore, considering the data presented, the patient is most likely experiencing cocaine-induced hallucinations.",Answer: Cocaine-induced hallucinations,N
"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe burning with urination for the past 3 days. During this period, he has had clear urethral discharge early in the morning.

"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. She was riding a bike when she lost control and hit a car on the opposite side of the road. On arrival, she is unconscious. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. Her pulse is 56/min, respirations are 8/min and irregular, and blood pressure is 196/102 mm Hg. Examination shows a 2-cm laceration over the left cheek and a 3-cm laceration over the left chest. There are multiple abrasions over her face and chest. She opens her eyes and flexes her extremities to painful stimuli. The pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light. There are decreased breath sounds over the left lung. The trachea is central. There is no jugular venous distention. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The left knee and right ankle are swollen; range of motion is limited. Two large-bore peripheral intravenous catheters are inserted. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is initiated.

"A 28-year-old female presents to her primary care physician because of pain on her right foot. She says that the pain began 2 weeks ago and gets worse with weight bearing. She has been training for a marathon, and this pain has limited her training. On exam, there are no signs of inflammation or deformities on her foot. Compression of the forefoot with concomitant pressure on the interdigital space reproduces the pain on the plantar surface between the third and fourth toes and produces an audible click. What is the cause of this patient's condition?",A benign neuroma,Plantar plate tear,N,Freiberg's infraction,N,Stress fracture,N,Morton's neuroma,Y,Freiberg's Infraction,N,,"Rationale: This patient has been training for a marathon and presents with foot pain exacerbated by weight-bearing, localized between the third and fourth toes, without signs of inflammation or deformity. Additionally, an audible click is heard during manipulation of the foot. These findings are consistent with a Morton's neuroma, a fibrous tissue formation around the digital nerve leading to the toes. It is often caused by irritation, pressure, or injury to one of the nerves leading to your toes, such as from intensive activities like running.",Answer: Morton's neuroma,Y,"The differential for this patient includes stress fractures, plantar fasciitis, metatarsalgia, Morton's neuroma, and bursitis. The pain localization between the third and fourth toes, exacerbated by weight bearing, and the click sound on compression suggest a mechanical etiology, namely, Morton's neuroma. This condition is due to a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to the toes and often presents with these symptoms. The fact that the patient has been training for a marathon, which would put repetitive stress on her feet, further supports this diagnosis.",Answer: Morton's neuroma.,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of pain between the third and fourth toes that worsens with weight bearing and is reproduced by compression of the forefoot, associated with an audible click, suggests Morton's neuroma. Morton's neuroma is a benign fibrous tissue formation around the digital nerves of the toes, often between the third and fourth metatarsal heads. It can be caused by repeated trauma or pressure, often in individuals who participate in activities such as running.",Answer: Morton's neuroma,Y,"Rationale:

This patient's pain with weight bearing and the reproduction of the pain with forefoot compression point toward Morton's neuroma, which is a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to the toes. This condition is common in individuals who run or engage in other high-impact sports. It tends to develop between the third and fourth toes, often due to wearing tight or high-heeled shoes or due to repetitive stress on the forefoot. The presence of the audible click, also known as Mulder's sign, is characteristic of this condition and helps to confirm the diagnosis.","Answer:

Morton's neuroma",Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Morton's neuroma in a healthy population is low, less than 1%. However, the fact that the patient is a runner increases the probability to about 10%, given that this condition is more prevalent among runners. The symptom of foot pain that gets worse with weight-bearing further raises the posterior probability to 40%. Finally, the physical examination findings - the reproduction of pain between the third and fourth toes with an audible click during forefoot compression - are characteristic for Morton's neuroma, raising the posterior probability to more than 80%. This patient likely has Morton's neuroma.",Answer: Morton's Neuroma,Y
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of involuntary, rhythmic movements of her hands for the past 5 months. Her symptoms initially affected her left hand only, but now both hands are affected. She also reports that her symptoms are worse at rest and that performing tasks such as tying her shoelaces and writing have become more difficult. Her husband thinks that she has been more withdrawn lately. She used to drink a half a bottle of sherry every day for the past 18 years but has not consumed alcohol in the past year. She has chronic liver disease, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. Current medications include aspirin and propanolol. She appears anxious. She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 144/82 mm Hg. Examination shows a rhythmic, low-frequency tremor that is more prominent in the left hand. Range of motion in the arms and legs is normal. Increased resistance to passive flexion and extension is present in the left upper limb. Muscle strength is 4/5 in all limbs. Sensations to pinprick and light touch are preserved. The finger-to-nose test is normal bilaterally. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",Degeneration of the substantia nigra,Essential tremor,N,Essential tremor,N,Essential tremor.,N,Essential tremor,N,Essential Tremor.,N,,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of involuntary, rhythmic movements of her hands that worsen at rest, difficulty performing fine motor tasks, and increased resistance to passive flexion and extension in the left upper limb are indicative of a movement disorder. The symptoms initially affecting only one side but later involving both sides, increased resistance to passive movement (rigidity), and the described tremor that is worse at rest all point towards Parkinson's disease. The anxiety and social withdrawal that the patient's husband has observed also align with the non-motor symptoms often associated with Parkinson's disease.",Answer: Parkinson's disease,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, Wilson's disease, and withdrawal from alcohol. The presence of rhythmic, involuntary movements which are more pronounced at rest, the report of difficulty with performing precise motor tasks, and the presence of increased resistance to passive movement in her left upper limb are consistent with Parkinson's disease. Essential tremor is usually improved at rest, not worsened. Wilson's disease would be unlikely given her age (usually presents in younger patients) and absence of other neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Alcohol withdrawal would usually present with additional symptoms such as seizures, hallucinations, and/or autonomic instability, and these symptoms usually appear shortly after discontinuing alcohol, not one year later. Furthermore, her husband notes that she has been more withdrawn lately, which could be a sign of the depressive symptoms often associated with Parkinson's disease. Her history of chronic liver disease also puts her at a slightly increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Therefore, Parkinson's disease is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms.",Answer: Parkinson's disease,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presenting symptoms include an involuntary, rhythmic tremor that is worse at rest, difficulty in performing tasks requiring fine motor control (like tying shoelaces and writing), and the withdrawal symptoms described by her husband. These symptoms, along with the observation of increased resistance to passive flexion and extension (referred to as lead-pipe rigidity), are suggestive of Parkinson's disease. It is characterized by a resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. The tremor is classically described as ""pill-rolling"" and is often more prominent at rest, and it may improve with purposeful movement. The patient's history of chronic alcohol use doesn't fit with her symptoms, as alcohol-related tremor is a postural tremor, not a resting tremor like in Parkinson's disease.",Answer: Parkinson's disease,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with involuntary, rhythmic movements of her hands, difficulty with tasks requiring fine motor skills, and has a history of chronic liver disease along with alcohol consumption. Her symptoms include a tremor that is more pronounced in one hand and increases resistance to passive movements in one upper limb. The combination of her history and the described symptoms suggest Parkinsonism, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. In this case, her history of chronic liver disease and alcohol consumption suggest that she may have hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause acquired (secondary) Parkinsonism due to the accumulation of manganese and other toxins in the basal ganglia secondary to liver dysfunction. Her liver's impaired ability to detoxify the blood leads to neurotoxic substances accumulating, affecting brain areas like the basal ganglia responsible for movement control.",Answer: Hepatic encephalopathy,N,"Rationale: The prior probability of Parkinson's Disease in an individual of this age group is around 1%. The patient presents with involuntary rhythmic movements in her hands, which is a common symptom of Parkinson's Disease, increasing the probability to 10%. The fact that the movements are worse at rest is characteristic of Parkinson's Disease, further increasing the probability to 20%. The patient also has difficulty in performing tasks that require fine motor control, like tying shoelaces, which is a feature of bradykinesia seen in Parkinson's Disease, increasing the probability to 35%. Moreover, the patient's presentation of increased resistance to passive motion in the left upper limb is indicative of rigidity, another symptom of Parkinson's Disease, raising the probability to 50%. Furthermore, the patient's history of being more withdrawn lately could be indicative of the depression or apathy associated with Parkinson's Disease, bringing the probability to 65%. Given the combination of rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and depression in this patient, Parkinson's Disease is the most likely underlying cause of the symptoms.",Answer: Parkinson's Disease,Y
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because his skin has been progressively yellowing for the past 4 weeks. He also reports low appetite and difficulty fitting into his pants because of his swollen legs over the past several months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He does not smoke and drinks 1 to 2 beers on special occasions. He used to be sexually active with multiple female partners but has lost interest in sexual intercourse recently. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); his BMI is 22 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows yellowing of the skin and sclera as well as erythema of the palms. There is bilateral enlargement of breast tissue. Cardiopulmonary examinations show no abnormalities. The abdomen is distended. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. On percussion of the left abdomen, a thrill can be felt on the right side. Hepatojugular reflux is absent. There is bilateral edema below the knees. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",Chronic viral hepatitis,Liver cirrhosis,N,Cirrhosis.,N,Cirrhosis,N,Cirrhosis,N,Cirrhosis,N,,"Rationale: This patient presents with jaundice (yellowing of the skin and sclera), loss of appetite, bilateral enlargement of breast tissue (gynecomastia), abdominal distention, and lower extremity edema. These are classical signs of liver dysfunction. The fact that the liver is palpated 2-3 cm below the right costal margin suggests hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). Furthermore, the presence of a thrill when percussing the left abdomen, which is felt on the right side, suggests the presence of free fluid in the abdomen, which is a sign of ascites. The combination of jaundice, gynecomastia, ascites, and lower extremity edema is highly suggestive of cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis can result from various causes such as chronic alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, since the patient does not have a history of heavy alcohol consumption and there is no information suggesting viral infection, the most likely cause of the cirrhosis in this patient is not clearly identifiable from the information given. The patient's sexual history does raise the possibility of chronic hepatitis, which could be due to viral infection such as Hepatitis B or C. Cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis is a possibility given the context.",Answer: Cirrhosis,N,"Rationale: This patient presents with several key findings including jaundice (yellowing of the skin and sclera), loss of appetite, gynecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue), abdominal distension, palpable liver, and bilateral leg edema. The erythema of the palms also suggests liver dysfunction. These symptoms and signs are highly indicative of liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. Cirrhosis can be caused by several factors such as alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, and others. Although this patient�s history mentions only occasional alcohol consumption, his history of being sexually active with multiple partners raises the possibility of viral hepatitis, which can also lead to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis leads to portal hypertension which can cause ascites (hence the abdominal distension), edema, and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver). Furthermore, liver dysfunction causes a buildup of bilirubin leading to jaundice, and altered metabolism of hormones leading to gynecomastia.",Answer: Liver cirrhosis,N,"Rationale: This 52-year-old man presents with yellowing of the skin and sclera (jaundice), swollen legs, loss of appetite, abdominal distention, palpable liver below the right costal margin, erythema of the palms, bilateral gynecomastia, and bilateral edema below the knees. The presence of jaundice indicates hyperbilirubinemia, which can be due to liver dysfunction. The abdominal distention with a palpable liver, edema, and absence of hepatojugular reflux suggests fluid accumulation within the abdominal cavity (ascites), and the presence of a thrill on percussion of the abdomen may be indicative of free fluid within the peritoneal cavity. Erythema of the palms and bilateral enlargement of breast tissue (gynecomastia) are associated with altered sex hormone metabolism, which is common in liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. The absence of alcohol abuse and the chronicity of symptoms are in line with cirrhosis, which can be due to various causes such as hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, or chronic alcohol consumption.

In the context of these findings (jaundice, ascites, palpable liver, erythema of palms, and gynecomastia) along with the history and examination findings, liver cirrhosis is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition.",Answer: Liver cirrhosis,N,"Rationale: This 52-year-old man is presenting with jaundice (yellowing of the skin and sclera), anorexia, gynecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue), abdominal distension, palpable liver, and lower extremity edema. The combination of these signs and symptoms is highly suggestive of liver disease, particularly cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is characterized by the scarring of the liver and poor liver function. The jaundice is likely due to the liver's inability to properly process bilirubin. Gynecomastia can be explained by an altered estrogen-androgen balance due to the liver's diminished capability to metabolize hormones. The abdominal distension could be secondary to ascites, which is the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity due to portal hypertension (a common complication of cirrhosis). The palpable liver and the fact that a thrill can be felt on percussion indicate hepatomegaly and possible collateral circulation due to portal hypertension. Lastly, the bilateral edema below the knees can be attributed to hypoalbuminemia, which is a decrease in albumin levels due to the liver�s impaired synthetic function, leading to reduced oncotic pressure and fluid leakage into the interstitial space.",Answer: Cirrhosis,N,"Rationale: We'll perform Bayesian inference to deduce the correct response to the question.

The prior probability of liver disease in a 52-year-old man with no family history of serious illness can be considered relatively low.
However, the patient reports progressive yellowing of the skin, which is a symptom of jaundice. Jaundice can be a symptom of liver disease, and this increases the probability of liver disease being the underlying cause.
The patient also has low appetite, swelling of the legs, and ascites (as indicated by the distended abdomen and palpable liver), which are also signs of liver disease, and this further increases the probability.
Additionally, the patient exhibits gynecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) and loss of interest in sexual activity. These symptoms suggest hormonal changes, which can be linked to liver disease as the liver plays a role in the metabolism of hormones.
Furthermore, the presence of erythema on the palms is also a classic sign associated with liver disease.
The combination of these symptoms (jaundice, ascites, edema, gynecomastia, loss of libido, and erythema of the palms) very strongly suggests liver disease.
Based on the above analysis, the posterior probability of liver disease being the underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is very high.",Answer: Liver Disease,N
"A 26-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his friends because of blurred vision and slurred speech for the past 6 hours. He had some difficulty swallowing his food during lunch and has weakness in both arms. Two weeks ago, he had an upper respiratory infection that resolved spontaneously. He lives independently and returned from his grandparents' farm 2 days ago. He commonly consumes canned vegetables and fruits. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 10/min and labored, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows bilateral nystagmus and ptosis. The pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. Muscle strength of the facial muscles and bilateral upper extremities is decreased. Upper extremity deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause for this patient's symptoms?",Toxin that inhibits ACh release,Botulism,Y,Botulism,Y,Botulism,Y,Botulism,Y,Botulism,Y,,"Rationale: The 26-year-old man in the question presented with blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, weakness in arms, bilateral nystagmus, ptosis, and dilated pupils that are non-reactive to light. These symptoms point towards a neurological disorder. He had an upper respiratory infection two weeks ago, and his recent history of consuming canned vegetables and fruits is notable. These symptoms and history are suggestive of botulism, which can be caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum. Botulism can be foodborne, and consuming improperly stored canned foods is a common source. The bacteria produce a toxin that affects the nervous system leading to the symptoms described.",Answer: Botulism,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with several symptoms, including blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and weakness in both arms, which all suggest some form of neurological dysfunction. The differential diagnoses could include stroke, Guillain-Barre Syndrome, myasthenia gravis, or botulism.

Stroke typically presents acutely with one-sided symptoms, which does not match this patient's bilateral findings, so it's less likely.

Guillain-Barre Syndrome, an immune-mediated neuropathy, often follows an infection and presents with ascending paralysis. However, this condition typically starts with weakness in the legs, not the arms or face, and it does not explain his pupillary findings.

Myasthenia gravis could explain the ptosis and general weakness, but it doesn't typically cause dilated pupils, nor would it explain the acute onset following an upper respiratory infection.

Botulism, caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, presents with descending paralysis starting with the cranial nerves, which aligns with this patient's symptoms (blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, weakness in arms). Additionally, botulism is associated with ingestion of home-canned foods, and the patient's history notes he consumes canned fruits and vegetables, which might not have been adequately sterilized.

So, given his symptoms and exposure history, botulism seems to be the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Botulism,Y,"Rationale: This patient presents with blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, weakness in both arms, bilateral nystagmus, ptosis, dilated pupils that are not reactive to light, and decreased muscle strength of facial muscles and bilateral upper extremities. These symptoms indicate neuromuscular impairment. The patient�s recent upper respiratory infection, followed by these acute neurological symptoms, as well as a history of consuming canned vegetables and fruits, raises concern for botulism. Botulism is a serious illness caused by the toxin produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria. It can manifest as foodborne botulism, especially when consuming improperly canned foods, which is likely in this case. Botulism affects the nervous system and leads to muscle weakness and paralysis, which corresponds with the symptoms seen in this patient. Additionally, the history of a recent visit to his grandparents' farm might indicate a potential source for exposure to the bacteria.",Answer: Botulism,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, weakness in both arms, bilateral nystagmus, and ptosis, with a recent history of an upper respiratory infection. These symptoms are suggestive of a disorder affecting the nerves and muscles. The history of consuming canned vegetables and fruits, combined with the symptoms, suggests that the patient might be suffering from botulism, which is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. Botulism toxin inhibits acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, which can lead to the symptoms of muscle weakness and paralysis. The toxin can contaminate improperly canned or preserved foods, which explains the association with the patient�s consumption of canned vegetables and fruits.",Answer: Botulism,Y,"Rationale: Let's evaluate the patient's situation using Bayesian inference. The prior probability of botulism in a random individual is very low. However, let's consider the given information:The patient has blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and weakness in arms which are characteristic symptoms of botulism. This increases the probability.

The patient recently had an upper respiratory infection, which is not specifically related to botulism but can be a general sign of compromised health and therefore slightly increases the probability.

The patient consumed canned vegetables and fruits. Improperly canned food is a common source of botulism, which significantly raises the probability of botulism as a diagnosis.

He also returned from his grandparents' farm. This information may or may not be relevant but could imply exposure to home-canned foods, raising the probability further.

The examination shows bilateral nystagmus, ptosis, and dilated pupils which are not reactive to light. These signs are consistent with botulism, raising the probability even more.

The patient has decreased muscle strength in facial muscles and upper extremities with reduced deep tendon reflexes. This is also consistent with botulism, raising the probability even higher.

Taking all these factors into account, the posterior probability of botulism is significantly raised given the combination of characteristic symptoms, consumption of canned foods, and the clinical signs observed.",Answer: Botulism,Y
"A 59-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a sudden-onset sensation that the room is spinning causing him to experience several episodes of nausea and vomiting. Upon arriving, the patient’s symptoms have resolved. He states his symptoms occurred as he was going to bed. He has never experienced this before, but felt extremely dizzy for roughly 3 minutes. He currently feels at his baseline. The patient is otherwise healthy and only has a history of eczema. His temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 134/85 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a healthy man with a normal gait. The patient has a physiologic nystagmus and his cranial nerve exam is unremarkable. The patient’s head is turned to the left and he is laid back on the stretcher, which exacerbates severe symptoms with a nystagmus notable. The patient’s symptoms improve after 2 minutes of being in this position. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo,BPPV,Y,BPPV.,Y,BPPV,Y,BPPV,Y,BPPV,Y,,"Rationale: The patient is a 59-year-old man who presents with sudden-onset dizziness, the sensation that the room is spinning, and episodes of nausea and vomiting. The symptoms occurred as he was going to bed, lasted for a short duration, and have since resolved. The fact that the symptoms were provoked by changes in head position, notably when his head was turned to the left and he was laid back, strongly suggests a problem with the inner ear's ability to sense position and movement. In particular, these symptoms are characteristic of Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV). BPPV occurs when tiny calcium particles accumulate in the inner ear. The inner ear sends signals to the brain about head and body movements relative to gravity. BPPV can occur when these particles disrupt the signals, causing the brain to receive mixed signals about the body�s position, which causes the sensation of spinning or movement.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient includes benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuronitis, Meniere's disease, medication side effects, or a cerebrovascular event. The patient�s symptoms of room spinning (vertigo), nausea, and nystagmus that are triggered by a change in head position and resolve quickly are characteristic of BPPV. Vestibular neuronitis usually presents with a single, prolonged episode of severe vertigo. Meniere's disease is characterized by episodes of vertigo, ringing in the ear, and hearing loss. Medication side effects or intoxication would likely have additional symptoms or a history of medication use. A cerebrovascular event is less likely given the short duration of symptoms and the trigger of changing head position. Additionally, the patient�s symptoms being triggered specifically by lying back with the head turned to one side and then improving after a short time is consistent with the typical presentation of BPPV.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y,"Rationale: This patient experienced a sudden onset of vertigo (a spinning sensation), nausea, and vomiting, which are classic symptoms of a disturbance in the inner ear. The fact that these symptoms occurred as he was going to bed and were exacerbated by changing the position of his head (laying back with the head turned to the left) are characteristic of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by small calcium particles in the inner ear. The inner ear helps to control balance, and when these particles disrupt the normal signals to the brain about head and body movements relative to gravity, it can cause vertigo. The symptoms are often triggered by specific changes in the position of the head, such as tipping the head up or down, and are usually brief but can be intense and bothersome.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y,"Rationale: The patient presents with a sudden onset of spinning sensation, nausea, and vomiting, which lasted for a short duration and then resolved. These symptoms are characteristic of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). In BPPV, the otoconia (tiny crystals of calcium) in the inner ear become dislodged and move into the semicircular canals, which are sensitive to head movements. When the head is moved in certain positions, these otoconia shift, causing the fluid in the canals to move, which in turn leads to a spinning sensation. The symptoms are typically triggered by changes in the position of the head, such as turning in bed, and they usually last for a short duration. The presence of nystagmus (involuntary eye movements) and the provocation of symptoms with the Dix-Hallpike maneuver (turning the head to one side and quickly laying the patient back) are characteristic findings in BPPV.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in the general population is around 2.4%. However, in this case, the patient presents with a sudden onset of spinning sensation, nausea, and vomiting, which are characteristic symptoms of BPPV, increasing the probability to 25%. Additionally, the patient's symptoms resolved quickly, which is also consistent with BPPV, increasing the probability further to 40%. The patient�s symptoms were triggered by a change in head position, and the fact that the symptoms were exacerbated with head movement, typical of BPPV, increases the probability to 60%. The presence of nystagmus, especially positional nystagmus, which is characteristic of BPPV, further increases the probability to 80%. Finally, the patient�s symptoms improving after being in the triggering position for a period of time is highly indicative of BPPV, increasing the posterior probability to approximately 95%. The patient most likely has benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.",Answer: Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,Y
A 17-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive right knee pain for the past 3 months. He reports that the pain is worse at night and while doing sports at school. He has not had any trauma to the knee or any previous problems with his joints. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows mild swelling and tenderness without warmth or erythema; the range of motion is limited. He walks with an antalgic gait. Laboratory studies show an alkaline phosphatase of 180 U/L and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 80 mm/h. An x-ray of the right knee is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Osteosarcoma,Osteoarthritis,N,Osteoarthritis,N,Septic arthritis,N,Juvenile idiopathic arthritis,N,Osteomyelitis,N,,"Rationale: The patient is a 17-year-old boy experiencing progressive right knee pain for the past 3 months, which is worse at night and during physical activities. He has mild swelling and tenderness in the right knee, along with an antalgic gait. The fact that the pain is worse at night suggests a possible bone lesion. Additionally, the elevation in alkaline phosphatase (which is indicative of bone turnover) and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (which indicates inflammation) support this. His age and clinical features are characteristic of osteosarcoma, which is a common primary malignant bone tumor in adolescents and children.",Answer: Osteosarcoma,Y,"Rationale: The differential diagnosis for a 17-year-old boy with progressive right knee pain includes osteosarcoma, growing pains, osteomyelitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Osgood-Schlatter disease, and stress fracture. The fact that the pain is progressive, worse at night, and associated with mild swelling and tenderness makes a benign condition like growing pains less likely. The absence of warmth and erythema makes an inflammatory or infectious cause like osteomyelitis or juvenile idiopathic arthritis less likely. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate indicate increased bone turnover and inflammation, respectively, which are more consistent with osteosarcoma. Additionally, the age of the patient is typical for osteosarcoma, which often presents in adolescents. The mention of an x-ray also implies a bony lesion. Therefore, considering his age, clinical features, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is osteosarcoma.",Answer: Osteosarcoma,Y,"Rationale: The 17-year-old boy presents with progressive right knee pain, especially during activity and at night, which has lasted for three months. His knee examination reveals mild swelling and tenderness, but without warmth or erythema, which are signs typically associated with infection or inflammation. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are suggestive of bone remodeling or ongoing chronic process. The antalgic gait and limitation in the range of motion of the knee are indicative of pain associated with weight-bearing or movement. It's noteworthy that the age of the patient and the nocturnal exacerbation of pain are characteristic features of osteosarcoma. Although an x-ray is mentioned, the details of the x-ray are not provided, but in osteosarcoma, one may expect to see a destructive bone lesion with a 'sunburst' pattern of periosteal elevation. Considering the age, clinical features, and laboratory findings, osteosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Osteosarcoma,Y,"Rationale: The 17-year-old boy presents with progressive right knee pain that is worse at night and during physical activity, and has been ongoing for 3 months. He has mild swelling and tenderness of the knee without warmth or erythema. He has an antalgic gait which indicates pain during walking. His laboratory studies are significant for an elevated alkaline phosphatase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The elevation in alkaline phosphatase could be related to increased bone turnover or bone growth, which is common in adolescents. However, the chronic pain, especially at night, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which indicates inflammation, points towards a bone tumor. Osteosarcoma is a common primary malignant bone tumor that occurs predominantly in adolescents and young adults, typically arising in the metaphysis of long bones such as the distal femur, which is close to the knee. Osteosarcoma often presents with pain that is worse at night and a palpable mass or swelling. The combination of these findings makes osteosarcoma the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Osteosarcoma,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Osgood-Schlatter disease in an adolescent male presenting with knee pain is around 10%. However, the patient has been experiencing pain for the past 3 months and the pain is worse during sports, this would increase the probability to about 20%. Since there is no history of trauma and the patient is in adolescence, this increases the likelihood of Osgood-Schlatter disease, pushing the probability to 30%. The presence of mild swelling and tenderness without warmth or erythema, and an antalgic gait further support the diagnosis, increasing the probability to 50%. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are also consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, elevating the probability to 60%. Considering all these features, Osgood-Schlatter disease is the most likely diagnosis.",Answer: Osgood-Schlatter disease,N
"A 28-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious outside of a local night club by her friends. On arrival the patient is stuporous. Her temperature is 35°C (95°F), blood pressure is 105/75 mm Hg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 10/min. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are small and react sluggishly to light. She does not respond to any commands, and painful stimuli cause her to withdraw all extremities.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?",Heroin,Opioid overdose.,Y,Opioid overdose,Y,Opioid intoxication,Y,Drug overdose,N,Drug overdose,N,,"Rationale: The patient presents with symptoms such as being found unconscious, a lower than normal body temperature, lower than normal pulse, slower respirations, dry mucous membranes, and small, sluggish pupils. These symptoms could be indicative of opioid toxicity or poisoning, which is known to cause reduced consciousness, respiratory depression, and miosis (constricted pupils). The absence of injection marks doesn't rule out opioid intoxication, as opioids can be consumed in several ways, including oral ingestion or nasal inhalation. Furthermore, considering the context that she was found outside a nightclub, substance abuse should be strongly suspected.",Answer: Opioid intoxication,Y,"Rationale: The differential for this patient could include alcohol intoxication, hypoglycemia, drug intoxication (opioids, benzodiazepines, GHB, or others), cold exposure/hypothermia, or a central nervous system event such as a stroke or seizure. The patient has bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypothermia, and miosis (small pupils), all of which are characteristic of opioid intoxication. No injection marks are present, but opioids can be taken in various ways, not just intravenously, such as orally or via inhalation. Additionally, the club setting might suggest the use of recreational drugs. Other possible causes are less likely due to absence of characteristic symptoms or signs. Hypoglycemia typically causes altered mental status but is also associated with symptoms like sweating, trembling, and tachycardia. Alcohol intoxication usually causes larger (dilated) pupils, not miosis. Hypothermia due to cold exposure alone would not explain miosis or the decreased level of consciousness. Lastly, a CNS event like a stroke is less likely given the patient's age and lack of focal neurological signs.",Answer: Opioid intoxication,Y,"Rationale: This patient's presentation of stupor, bradycardia (slow heart rate), hypothermia (low body temperature), miosis (small pupils), and dry mucous membranes suggest the use of an opioid. The absence of injection marks doesn't exclude opioid use, as opioids can be consumed in many forms (ingested, inhaled, transdermal). Opioids, such as heroin, morphine, or prescription pain killers, cause CNS and respiratory depression leading to decreased responsiveness and slow respirations. Hence, this patient's symptoms are most likely due to opioid intoxication.",Answer: Opioid intoxication.,Y,"Rationale:

This patient presents with a reduced level of consciousness (stupor), low body temperature (hypothermia), low heart rate (bradycardia), and slow respirations (bradypnea), along with dry mucous membranes. Her pupils are small and sluggish in their response to light. These symptoms are suggestive of opioid overdose. Although no injection marks are visible, opioids can also be ingested orally or inhaled, and the absence of injection marks does not rule out the possibility. Opioids act by depressing the central nervous system, slowing both heart rate and respiration, potentially to life-threatening levels. They also constrict pupils, leading to the characteristic ""pinpoint pupils"" seen in opioid overdose.",Answer: Opioid overdose,Y,"Rationale:

The initial probability of opioid overdose might be around 1% in a normal population, but in the context of a young person found unconscious outside a nightclub, the probability might increase to around 10% given the common use of recreational drugs in such settings. The presentation of the patient, with stupor, slow pulse rate, and slow breathing, is consistent with opioid overdose, raising the probability further to around 40%. Dry mucous membranes might suggest dehydration or another condition, but it is non-specific and doesn't strongly swing the probability one way or the other. The small, sluggishly reactive pupils are a common symptom of opioid use, increasing the posterior probability to around 70%. While the lack of injection marks might initially seem to argue against opioid use, it's important to remember that opioids can also be taken orally, nasally, or even transdermally, so this doesn't significantly lower the probability. Given this combination of factors, the patient's symptoms are most likely caused by an opioid overdose.","Answer:

"A 70-year-old woman presents with a 2-week history of severe fatigue. Over the past month, she has unintentionally lost 2 kg (4.4 lb). Three years ago, she was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Currently, she takes no medications other than aspirin for occasional knee pain. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her vital signs are within the normal range. On physical examination, her conjunctivae are pale. Petechiae are present on the distal lower extremities and on the soft and hard palates.

These symptoms, along with her existing diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, point to a blood-related issue. The Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear mentioned but not shown presumably demonstrates an abnormality in the cells. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a group of disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells or ones that don't work correctly, which over time can lead to bone marrow failure. Her symptoms and the presentation suggest that her condition may have progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a potential outcome for patients with myelodysplastic syndrome.",Answer: Acute myeloid leukemia,Y,"Rationale:
The differential diagnosis for a 70-year-old woman with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who presents with severe fatigue, weight loss, pale conjunctiva, petechiae, painless cervical lymphadenopathy and low counts of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets includes:

Progression of her existing myelodysplastic syndrome to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
Aplastic anemia
Advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
Lymphoma
Metastatic disease
The presence of painless lymphadenopathy, which is typically associated with lymphomas or leukemias, narrows the differential to AML, CLL, or lymphoma.

However, the presence of cytopenias across all three cell lines (pancytopenia) is a common feature of AML. Although MDS itself can present with pancytopenia, the progressive symptoms, increased fatigue, weight loss and low blood cell counts are all suggestive of a progression from MDS to AML.

Further, the presence of pancytopenia and a previous history of MDS is highly suggestive of progression to AML. Indeed, approximately 30% of patients with MDS will progress to AML. Given the clinical history and presentation, this progression is the most likely explanation for her current findings.",Answer: Acute Myeloid Leukemia,Y,"Given the patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome, severe fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and the physical findings of pale conjunctivae, petechiae, and painless cervical lymphadenopathy, the most likely diagnosis is acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) can progress to AML, which is characterized by fatigue due to anemia, unintentional weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The laboratory findings of anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low leukocyte count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) also suggest a diagnosis of AML, although the presence of the abnormal cells in the peripheral blood smear (which is not shown but presumed) would be key to confirming the diagnosis.",Answer: Acute myeloid leukemia.,Y,"Rationale: The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome, a group of disorders caused by poorly formed blood cells or cells that do not work properly, could be a precursor to the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The symptoms she is currently experiencing, such as fatigue, unintentional weight loss, pale conjunctivae (indicating anemia), petechiae (indicating thrombocytopenia), and cervical lymphadenopathy, all are suggestive of a possible progression to AML. Furthermore, her laboratory studies show anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low leukocyte count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which are consistent with a diagnosis of AML. Finally, AML is often confirmed by the presence of myeloblasts on a peripheral blood smear, which was presumably shown in the image.",Answer: Acute myeloid leukemia,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of the woman having progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is 30%, given her myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosis. The presence of fatigue and unintentional weight loss, common in cancers, increases the posterior probability of AML to 45%. The pale conjunctivae, suggestive of anemia, align with the low hemoglobin level and increase the probability of AML to 60%. Petechiae, resulting from thrombocytopenia, further raise the probability to 75%, considering her low platelet count. Bilateral painless cervical lymphadenopathy, often associated with hematologic malignancies, increases the probability of AML to 85%. The low leukocyte count, another symptom of AML, raises the probability to 95%.

These clinical features, along with her history of depression and family history of suicide, are suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder, more specifically, Huntington's Disease. This condition is characterized by psychiatric disturbances (including depression and psychosis), cognitive decline, and chorea, which is a type of abnormal involuntary movement described here.",Answer: Huntington's Disease,Y,"Rationale:
The differential for this patient includes various neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, drug-induced psychosis or Parkinson's disease. However, some key aspects of this presentation stand out. She presents with abnormal behavior, restlessness, auditory hallucinations, dysphagia, confusion, and poor articulation, which might suggest a psychiatric disorder. However, the presence of neurological signs, specifically irregular, nonrepetitive, and arrhythmic movements of the neck and head, and a delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex (a type of hyperreflexia) are indicative of a neurological disorder.

Her history of drug use may contribute to her presentation but would not account for all her symptoms, particularly the delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex. The progression of symptoms, her age, and family history of her father committing suicide (suggestive of a possibly inherited disorder) point towards a degenerative condition.

Given these findings, Huntington's Disease is a high possibility.

She demonstrates all three of these.",Answer: Huntington's Disease,Y,"Rationale: The patient's presentation of abnormal behavior, irritability, restlessness, auditory hallucinations, difficulty swallowing, job performance issues due to inability to manage tasks, confusion, and specific neurological signs such as the described movement irregularities and poor articulation are highly suggestive of Huntington's disease. This disease is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of neurons in the brain, leading to physical, cognitive, and psychiatric abnormalities. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, suggesting her father's suicide might have been related to the same disease. The delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex might be indicative of striatal degeneration, commonly observed in Huntington's disease. Her history of cocaine use may have exacerbated her symptoms but her presentation is most consistent with Huntington's.",Answer: Huntington's disease,Y,"Rationale: This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with Huntington's disease, a progressive brain disorder that leads to uncontrolled movements, cognitive problems, and emotional disturbances. The disease is inherited, and the patient's family history of a father who committed suicide could potentially be relevant, as emotional disturbances such as depression are common in those with Huntington's. The neurological symptoms described, such as irregular and non-repetitive movements of the neck and head, and poor articulation, are common in Huntington's. The patient's cognitive symptoms, such as restlessness, hearing voices, and confusion, as well as her difficulty swallowing and the deterioration of her work performance, are all indicative of the progression of the disease.",Answer: Huntington's Disease,Y,"Rationale: The prior probability of Huntington's disease in the general population is low, about 0.005%. However, several factors increase this probability in this patient. First, her father's suicide could be related to a depressive or cognitive condition, possibly Huntington's, increasing the posterior probability to approximately 1%. The patient's symptoms of irritability, restlessness, auditory hallucinations, and cognitive decline further increase the probability to 15%. Her dysphagia and delayed return to neutral ankle position after triggering the plantar reflex could signify neurological degeneration, which pushes the probability up to 30%. Lastly, the key clue here is the irregular, nonrepetitive, and arrhythmic movements of the neck and head, which are indicative of chorea, a common symptom in Huntington's disease, raising the probability to about 70%. Considering all these features together, it's highly likely this patient is suffering from Huntington's disease.",Answer: Huntington's disease,Y
"A 64-year-old woman has progressively worsening abdominal pain 5 hours after an open valve replacement with cardiopulmonary bypass. The pain is crampy and associated with an urge to defecate. The patient reports having had 2 bloody bowel movements in the last hour.

After the surgery, she has been experiencing abdominal pain and bloody bowel movements. One cause of these symptoms in the context of recent surgery is mesenteric ischemia. During times of low blood flow, such as surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or significant blood loss, the intestines can become ischemic because they are supplied by end-arteries, which don't have much collateral circulation. Ischemia can cause damage to the intestinal mucosa, leading to bloody bowel movements. The abdominal pain and urge to defecate can be explained by irritation of the intestines due to the ischemia.
","Mesenteric Ischemia



",Y,"The differential diagnoses for this patient who is experiencing abdominal pain and bloody bowel movements after an operation include bowel ischemia, acute mesenteric ischemia, diverticulosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and side effects from the opioid medications.

In this patient's case, the abdominal pain is associated with an urge to defecate, which makes ischemic causes more likely than a simple gastrointestinal bleed. The fact that the pain worsened after the operation and is associated with bloody bowel movements makes ischemic colitis more likely. Additionally, the blood loss and blood transfusions may have led to low blood flow or hypoperfusion to the intestines, further increasing the risk of bowel ischemia.

Acute mesenteric ischemia is usually associated with more severe abdominal pain that is out of proportion to physical findings. However, the patient's symptoms do not seem to match this pattern. She has mild tenderness but not severe abdominal pain.

While opioid use can lead to constipation, it would not account for the bloody bowel movements.

Diverticulosis could also present with bloody stools, but it would not explain the abdominal pain, especially not in the setting of a recent surgery with significant blood loss.

Given her history of surgery with significant intraoperative blood loss, the most likely diagnosis is ischemic colitis.","Ischemic colitis.



",Y,"This patient's symptoms of progressive abdominal pain, an urge to defecate, bloody bowel movements, and a recent history of major surgery with significant blood loss suggest ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis occurs when there's reduced blood flow to the colon, often due to hypotension, atherosclerosis, or as in this case, possibly intraoperative hypotension and blood loss. It typically presents with abdominal pain, an urge to defecate, and bloody bowel movements. Furthermore, her history of hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus put her at a higher risk for vascular disease, which could contribute to colonic ischemia. Thus, it is most likely that the patient's symptoms are due to ischemic colitis.","Ischemic colitis



",Y,"This patient's postoperative presentation with abdominal pain, bloody bowel movements, and decreased bowel sounds is suggestive of ischemic colitis. The prolonged operation with significant blood loss likely contributed to a state of low blood flow (ischemia), particularly to the colon, which is sensitive to such changes. The watershed areas of the colon, such as the splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction, are especially susceptible to ischemia because they are areas of the body where the blood supply is the least redundant. Reduced blood flow to these areas during the patient's operation and the resultant ischemia could lead to the colonic mucosal damage and subsequent symptoms seen in this patient.",Ischemic colitis.,Y,"The prior probability of ischemic bowel disease is typically low, but certain factors in this patient's history can modify this. This patient underwent a procedure with cardiopulmonary bypass which poses a risk for nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, increasing the posterior probability of ischemic bowel disease to, say, 15%. The presence of severe abdominal pain, which is a common symptom of bowel ischemia, could increase the probability further to around 35%. The urgent and repetitive defecation with bloody stool raises the probability to approximately 55%, as these are symptoms frequently seen in ischemic bowel disease. The fact that the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (which may imply advanced atherosclerosis) can increase the posterior probability to around 75%, as this disease is a major risk factor for ischemic bowel disease. The fact that the pain came on after a surgery, in which significant blood loss occurred, further suggests the possibility of ischemic bowel disease, because the blood flow to the bowel may have been compromised during the procedure. Taking all this into account, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is ischemic bowel disease.","Ischemic bowel disease.

"A 48-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with complaints of persistent fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss for the past 3 months. She has a history of hypothyroidism and takes thyroxine replacement. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg in a supine position and 65/40 mm Hg while sitting, temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), and pulse is 75/min. On physical examination, there is a mild increase in thyroid size, with a rubbery consistency. Her skin shows diffuse hyperpigmentation, more pronounced in the oral mucosa and palmar creases. What best represent the etiology of this patient’s condition?",Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal gland,Addison's Disease,Y,Addison's disease,Y,Addison's Disease,Y,Primary adrenal insufficiency,Y,Addison's Disease,Y,,"This patient has several symptoms which together point towards a diagnosis of Addison's disease. Addison's disease is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce sufficient steroid hormones. This can lead to a number of symptoms including fatigue, dizziness, low blood pressure, and weight loss - all symptoms that this patient is experiencing. Additionally, the hyperpigmentation seen in this patient is a characteristic sign of Addison's disease. It occurs because a lack of cortisol leads to an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which can stimulate melanocytes, leading to hyperpigmentation. Although this patient has a history of hypothyroidism and is on thyroxine replacement, her symptoms and presentation do not align with typical manifestations of hypothyroidism, such as cold intolerance, constipation, and depression, but rather suggest adrenal insufficiency.","Addison's disease



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease), malnutrition, infection, thyroid disorder, or other systemic diseases. Her persistent fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss along with postural hypotension (a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 20 mm Hg or a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg within three minutes of standing) are indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Moreover, hyperpigmentation, especially in the oral mucosa and palmar creases, is a classic sign of primary adrenal insufficiency. This is due to the increase in melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) secondary to elevated levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor molecule for both adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and MSH. Increased ACTH stimulates melanocytes because of the similarity in structure between ACTH and MSH. Furthermore, she has hypothyroidism, which suggests an autoimmune etiology, as both Addison's disease and autoimmune thyroid disease can be seen together as part of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease.","Addison's Disease



",Y,"This patient is showing symptoms such as persistent fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss which are general and can indicate a wide array of conditions. However, the presence of low blood pressure, especially upon sitting up, and the hyperpigmentation of the skin, especially in areas not typically exposed to the sun like the oral mucosa and palmar creases, strongly suggest the possibility of Addison's disease. The mentioned symptoms are characteristic for Addison's disease, an adrenal insufficiency condition that results from the damage to the adrenal cortex, leading to decreased production of cortisol and aldosterone. This can cause hyperpigmentation due to increased ACTH production as a response to low cortisol levels, which cross-reacts with melanocortin-1 receptors in the skin, causing the pigmentation. Her history of hypothyroidism, another endocrine gland disorder, further supports the possibility of an autoimmune etiology, as Addison's disease is often autoimmune in nature.","Addison's disease



",Y,"This patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, dizziness, and weight loss, along with the physical findings of diffuse hyperpigmentation (especially pronounced in the oral mucosa and palmar creases), and low blood pressure are all indicative of Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency). The hypotension that's exacerbated upon postural change is due to mineralocorticoid deficiency leading to hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and volume depletion, resulting in orthostatic hypotension. The hyperpigmentation is a result of increased production of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which is a consequence of increased production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) as a response to chronic ACTH elevation (due to lack of cortisol feedback). Additionally, the presence of a slightly enlarged, rubbery thyroid may hint at an autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, where multiple endocrine organs are affected, including the thyroid (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and adrenal glands (Addison's disease).","Addison's disease



",Y,"The prior probability for Addison's disease in general population is quite low. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms including persistent fatigue, weight loss, hypotension, and hyperpigmentation increase the likelihood of Addison's disease significantly. Her symptoms are quite characteristic for Addison's disease which causes chronic primary adrenal insufficiency and results in a deficiency of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and adrenal androgens.

Fatigue and weight loss are common symptoms in Addison's disease, which could increase the likelihood to about 20%. The presence of hyperpigmentation, especially in the oral mucosa and palmar creases, is due to increased melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) as a result of elevated proopiomelanocortin (POMC) levels. This might increase the likelihood further to about 60%.

The fact that she has orthostatic hypotension (fall in blood pressure on standing up), which is caused by a deficiency of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, would increase the likelihood of Addison's disease even more, potentially bringing it up to around 80%.

Lastly, she also has a history of another autoimmune disease - hypothyroidism. Patients with one autoimmune disease are at increased risk for developing others, further increasing the probability of Addison's disease, perhaps to about 90%. This step-by-step Bayesian reasoning supports the conclusion that Addison's disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.","Addison's disease

Jaundice in newborns is often due to an increase in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. The provided laboratory studies show a total bilirubin of 16.1 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin of 0.7 mg/dL. Therefore, the majority of the bilirubin is unconjugated. Also, the fact that her older brother died 3 months after liver surgery might indicate a genetic liver condition in the family. The patient's symptoms and the high indirect bilirubin level suggest Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability of the liver to convert and excrete bilirubin properly.","Crigler-Najjar Syndrome



",N,"The differential for this newborn could include: breastfeeding jaundice, breast milk jaundice, biliary atresia, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert's syndrome, neonatal hepatitis, or hemolytic disease of the newborn.

The lab results show a high total bilirubin, but a normal direct bilirubin, which indicates an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This rules out conditions that would cause an increase in direct (conjugated) bilirubin such as biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. The newborn's age (2-week-old) rules out breastfeeding jaundice, which typically presents in the first week of life, and the serum bilirubin is too high for Gilbert's syndrome. Hemolytic disease of the newborn is less likely due to the normal hematocrit level.

Given the normal hematocrit, liver enzymes, and the high level of unconjugated bilirubin, this patient likely has breast milk jaundice, which is a normal variant and not a disease process. However, a concerning feature of this case is that the newborn's older brother died three months after liver surgery, which could indicate a genetic condition, such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome. In Crigler-Najjar syndrome, there is an absence or deficiency of the enzyme that conjugates bilirubin in the liver, leading to high levels of unconjugated bilirubin.

Taking into account both the clinical picture and family history, the most likely diagnosis for this newborn is Crigler-Najjar syndrome.","Crigler-Najjar syndrome



",N,"The infant's clinical presentation with jaundice extending to the palms and soles, combined with the liver enlargement and elevated indirect bilirubin are concerning for biliary atresia, a condition involving obstruction or absence of the bile ducts. Her older brother's early death following liver surgery may also suggest a familial component of a liver disease like biliary atresia. Biliary atresia usually presents in the first few weeks of life with jaundice, dark urine, and hepatomegaly, as in this case. Moreover, direct (conjugated) bilirubin is usually normal or mildly elevated while total bilirubin is significantly elevated due to increased indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin, as seen in this patient.","Biliary atresia



",N,"The symptoms presented by this 2-week-old female newborn - yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin (jaundice), along with the laboratory findings, primarily elevated total bilirubin and relatively normal direct bilirubin, AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase levels - suggest a disorder of bilirubin metabolism. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal jaundice.

Neonatal jaundice is a common condition in newborns, caused by an imbalance between the production and conjugation of bilirubin. In this case, the high total bilirubin and low direct (conjugated) bilirubin indicate that the issue is with the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver, as direct bilirubin is a form that has been processed by the liver.

Moreover, the fact that she is exclusively breastfed might contribute to her condition, as breastfed babies are at higher risk of developing jaundice. The jaundice appears to be severe, as it has spread to her palms and soles.

However, the sudden death of her brother after liver surgery suggests a possible familial disease related to liver function, such as a congenital form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, Gilbert's syndrome being the most common, or potentially a more serious condition like Crigler-Najjar syndrome. These conditions are characterized by an inability of the liver to properly process and excrete bilirubin, leading to elevated total and unconjugated bilirubin levels.","Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (Neonatal jaundice).



",N,"This case presents a 2-week-old female newborn with increasing yellow discoloration of her eyes and skin (jaundice) extending to the palms and soles, with a palpable liver, and with a laboratory study showing a high level of total bilirubin (16.1 mg/dL), with predominantly indirect bilirubin (unconjugated) which is indicated by the low direct bilirubin (0.7 mg/dL).

The prior probability for Crigler-Najjar Syndrome, a rare genetic condition characterized by an inability of the body to properly convert and excrete bilirubin, is low. However, given the predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, this condition becomes a possibility.

Step 1: The prior probability of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is around 0.01%, given the rarity of the condition.

Step 2: The high total bilirubin, predominantly indirect, in a neonate increases the posterior probability to around 10%. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a hallmark of this condition as the liver lacks the enzyme (UDP glucuronosyltransferase) required to convert unconjugated to conjugated bilirubin.

Step 3: The extension of jaundice to the palms and soles, indicating severe hyperbilirubinemia, further raises the posterior probability to around 20%.

Step 4: The family history, specifically the older brother dying 3 months after liver surgery, dramatically increases the probability to around 70%. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that the chance of siblings being affected is relatively high.

Based on these steps, this patient likely has Crigler-Najjar Syndrome.","Crigler-Najjar Syndrome

This illness is often characterized by high fever, severe headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Lymphadenopathy, as evidenced by the tender lymph nodes in the neck, can also be a feature of dengue fever.

Dengue fever is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, and is common in many tropical and subtropical regions around the world, including Brazil, Panama, and Peru. The rash in dengue typically is maculopapular and appears towards the end of the febrile phase of the illness.

Symptoms of NMS include hyperthermia, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysregulation, all of which are observed in this patient. Furthermore, the patient's elevated creatine kinase levels indicate rhabdomyolysis, which is consistent with NMS. The CSF studies and brain MRI findings rule out CNS infections or other brain disorders.","Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: meningitis, encephalitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), serotonin syndrome, malignant hyperthermia, and sepsis.
Given that he has fever, altered mental status, generalized rigidity, increased creatine kinase, and is on haloperidol (an antipsychotic medication), his presentation is most consistent with NMS. CSF studies are essentially normal, which rules out meningitis or encephalitis. The absence of clonus, hyperactive bowel sounds, and myoclonus make serotonin syndrome less likely. Malignant hyperthermia is typically associated with exposure to certain medications during general anesthesia, which is not the case here. And while sepsis could present with fever and altered mental status, it does not explain the muscle rigidity or increased creatine kinase, and the patient does not seem to have a source of infection. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is neuroleptic malignant syndrome.","Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

",Y,"This patient's presentation of fever, altered mental status, generalized rigidity, autonomic dysregulation (hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and tachycardia), and elevated creatine kinase is suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a potentially life-threatening condition often associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol in this case. The syndrome is thought to be due to dopamine D2 receptor antagonism leading to excess muscle contraction, increased heat production, and reduced heat dissipation. While there are several conditions that could mimic NMS (like meningitis or encephalitis), the negative CSF analysis and unremarkable brain MRI support a diagnosis of NMS over these other conditions.","Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

This patient is in the ICU and has multiple invasive devices in place, which all increase her risk for hospital-acquired infections.

Starting with sepsis, the patient's fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension are all indicative of a systemic response to infection. However, sepsis is a syndrome rather than a specific diagnosis, and the causative infection needs to be identified.

A catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is a potential diagnosis given the erythema around the catheter insertion site. More convincingly, the cultures from both the peripheral blood and the catheter tip grew S. aureus with a similar antibiogram, suggesting that the catheter may be the source of the bloodstream infection.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is less likely in this case because the chest CT scan does not show lung infiltration, which would typically be present in pneumonia.

Finally, a urinary tract infection (UTI) could explain the fever and is suggested by the polymicrobial growth in the urinary culture. However, this wouldn't account for the S. aureus in the bloodstream.

",Y,"This patient's symptoms, including fever, low blood pressure, and high heart rate, are suggestive of sepsis. Considering her clinical setting (ICU with a ventilator, hemodialysis via a central catheter, and an indwelling urinary catheter), these factors represent a high risk for infection. The erythema around the insertion site of the central catheter might suggest a local infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis. Blood cultures revealing S. aureus from both peripheral blood and the catheter tip indicate that the source of sepsis is likely the central catheter.

Specifically, these findings are highly suggestive of a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), a common occurrence in ICU patients with central venous catheters. The catheter provides a direct conduit for bacteria to enter the bloodstream, causing systemic signs of infection like the ones presented by this patient. The presence of S. aureus, a common pathogen in CLABSI, further supports this diagnosis. The fact that her urinary culture shows polymicrobial growth could mean that she also has a urinary tract infection due to the indwelling catheter, but the systemic symptoms and positive blood cultures are more indicative of a CLABSI.",Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection,Y,"Step 1: The prior probability of sepsis is high in a patient in the ICU, particularly one with multiple invasive lines such as a hemodialysis catheter and a urinary catheter.

The ECG shows absent P waves which are consistent with her history of atrial fibrillation. However, the symptoms of shock, and the nonspecific changes in the ST segment and the T wave, could indicate an acute cardiovascular event. Given her previous medical history and the current signs and symptoms, the most likely underlying mechanism for this sudden decline is cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to an acute myocardial infarction or arrhythmia.

The possibilities include: head trauma leading to intracranial bleeding, a cardiovascular event like myocardial infarction, or hypovolemic shock due to internal bleeding (for example from a hip fracture). However, given her history of atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation, the sudden decline in her condition following a head injury suggests a probable intracranial bleed. The patient's dizziness, pallor, diaphoresis, cold and clammy skin, faint tachycardia, and hypotension could all be attributed to the decrease in cerebral perfusion due to increased intracranial pressure from a bleed. Additionally, while the ECG shows changes, these are nonspecific and may be due to the physiological stress from a potential intracranial bleed rather than an acute myocardial event.",Intracranial bleeding,N,"This patient, with a history of atrial fibrillation and on anticoagulant therapy (apixaban), fell and hit her head which is concerning for an intracranial bleed, especially given the ecchymosis on her left temple and headache. However, the question asks about the sudden decline in her condition, marked by dizziness, palpitations, diaphoresis, pallor, and cold/clammy skin, along with a significantly low blood pressure and faint, rapid pulse. These are classic signs of shock. Given her history of atrial fibrillation and the finding of absent P waves on the EKG, this could be indicative of a serious cardiac rhythm disturbance. This, in conjunction with her trauma, could have precipitated a state of cardiogenic shock, which is a failure of the heart to pump adequately leading to poor perfusion and shock symptoms.",Cardiogenic shock,N,"The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation for which she takes apixaban, an anticoagulant. The fall resulted in a head trauma, evident from the ecchymosis over her left temple, which could have caused an intracranial hemorrhage - a known risk in patients on anticoagulant therapy, particularly following trauma. Intracranial hemorrhage could explain the headache, dizziness, and her acute decline. However, her hypotension, tachycardia, cold and clammy skin are indicative of shock. Given the acute onset of these symptoms and the recent trauma, a likely cause is hemorrhagic shock due to a ruptured blood vessel, possibly in the hip region due to the trauma and her pre-existing osteoporosis. This would lead to a rapid loss of circulating blood volume, resulting in decreased tissue perfusion, and potentially causing her symptoms of dizziness and palpitations, and the observed signs of shock.",Hemorrhagic shock,Y,"Starting from the prior information, the likelihood of a significant internal bleeding event for an elderly patient with a history of falls and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulants is quite high. Let's start with a rough estimate of 40%.

Her recent history of a fall and associated symptoms like a headache and severe hip pain, alongside a physical examination revealing tenderness and swelling of the hip and an ecchymosis on the left temple, would increase this probability, say to 70%, given the possibility of either intracranial bleeding or internal bleeding from a hip fracture.

Her current presentation with dizziness, palpitations, cold and clammy skin, and a faint, rapid pulse along with hypotension, are all indicative of shock, most likely due to hemorrhage. This further increases the probability of internal bleeding to about 90%.

The ECG changes do not clearly suggest a cardiac etiology (such as myocardial infarction), especially given the absence of chest pain or other characteristic symptoms and signs. Therefore, it's most probable that the sudden decline is due to hypovolemic shock secondary to internal bleeding from her injuries post-fall while on anticoagulant therapy.","Internal bleeding, Hypovolemic Shock",Y

These findings, coupled with the fact that she has had episodic pallor of her fingers since adolescence (Raynaud's phenomenon), suggest a connective tissue disease known as scleroderma. Scleroderma can cause dysmotility of the esophagus due to fibrosis and loss of the muscular layer, leading to dysphagia.",Scleroderma,Y,"The differential for this patient includes gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), esophageal stricture, esophageal cancer, achalasia, and scleroderma (also known as systemic sclerosis). GERD could lead to dysphagia but her use of omeprazole would have likely improved this.

The CREST acronym stands for Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia. Raynaud's phenomenon is suggested by her episodic finger pallor. Esophageal dysmotility, which presents as dysphagia, is commonly seen in scleroderma due to the fibrosis and loss of smooth muscle cells in the lower two-thirds (muscularis) of the esophagus. This can lead to dysphagia to solids and liquids, along with GERD, which she was previously diagnosed with.",Scleroderma (CREST Syndrome),Y,"The prior probability of the patient having scleroderma is given at 1%. However, the patient presents with thickening of the skin of her fingers and small white papules on her fingertips (sclerodactyly and calcinosis, respectively), both signs consistent with scleroderma, which increase the posterior probability to around 20%. The presence of small dilated blood vessels on her face, lips, and tongue (telangiectasias) further increases the likelihood of scleroderma to 40%. Moreover, her dysphagia - first with solids and then with liquids - suggests esophageal involvement, a common occurrence in scleroderma. This symptom brings the likelihood of scleroderma to 70%. Her episodic pallor of fingers since adolescence could be viewed as Raynaud's phenomenon, which is often seen in scleroderma, increasing the probability to 85%.

She has normal secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast development (indicating estrogen is present), and normal development of pubic hair (which is androgen dependent). The finding of a blind vaginal pouch on pelvic exam coupled with the absence of uterus on ultrasound but the presence of ovaries suggests the patient is suffering from Mullerian agenesis (also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome), where the M�llerian duct fails to develop, thus the uterus is absent, but ovaries are present as they develop from a different embryological structure, the genital ridge.",Mullerian agenesis,Y,"This patient presents with primary amenorrhea (no menstrual period by age 15), which could be caused by numerous conditions. However, the presence of normal breast development and the presence of pubic hair suggest that the patient is undergoing normal puberty and has functioning ovaries that are producing estrogen. The fact that she has a blind vaginal pouch and no visible uterus on ultrasound strongly indicates that she has a form of Mullerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.

Nephrotic syndrome is a kidney disorder that causes the body to excrete too much protein in the urine, which can lead to fluid buildup and swelling in different parts of the body. The recent infection (indicated by the rash) could have acted as a trigger, as post-infectious glomerulonephritis is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.",Nephrotic syndrome.,N,"The differential for this patient includes nephrotic syndrome, acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease), allergic reaction, and other kidney diseases. The periorbital edema, high blood pressure, and the presence of red blood cells in the urine all suggest a kidney-related disease. APSGN often presents with periorbital edema and hypertension. Moreover, APSGN typically occurs 1-2 weeks after a streptococcal infection, and this patient has a recent history of a skin infection (rash from wrestling), which could have been caused by streptococci. Therefore, this patient most likely has acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN).",Acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.,Y,"This child presents with periorbital edema (puffiness around the eyes), amber urine, and red blood cells in the urine. These findings suggest the presence of proteinuria, which causes fluid to leak from blood vessels into surrounding tissues, leading to edema, most noticeably around the eyes. The presence of red blood cells in the urine is also suggestive of a kidney disorder. The recent history of a skin infection treated with antibiotics is suggestive of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, a condition that can occur following a bacterial (streptococcal) infection, often of the skin or throat, resulting in inflammation of the glomeruli within the kidneys. This inflammation can lead to the symptoms described, including edema, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and hematuria (blood in the urine).",Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,Y,"The symptoms presented by the boy, particularly the periorbital edema (puffiness around the eyes) and the presence of red blood cells in his urine (hematuria), strongly suggest a renal issue, likely post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN). This is often seen in children after they have had an infection, such as a skin infection (impetigo) or a streptococcal throat infection. In this case, the boy had a skin rash from wrestling that was treated with a topical antibiotic, indicating a potential recent skin infection. PIGN results from immune complex deposition in the glomeruli of the kidneys following an infection, leading to inflammation and damage that can cause protein and blood to be present in the urine.

The fluid in the cervical canal and the positive ferning pattern on the glass slide, which refers to the crystallization pattern of amniotic fluid when it dries, confirms that the fluid is indeed amniotic fluid. As the patient has not experienced contractions, this presentation is most likely due to premature rupture of membranes (PROM). PROM is the rupture of fetal membranes before the onset of labor.",Premature rupture of membranes,Y,"The differential for this patient includes premature rupture of membranes (PROM), normal labor, urinary incontinence, and vaginal discharge.

The patient is at 38 weeks' gestation and is presenting with a sudden leakage of clear fluid from the vagina. This can occur in the context of normal labor but is less likely as there are no contractions reported.

Urinary incontinence can also present with leakage of fluid but is less likely in this scenario because the fluid was found in the cervical canal and not in the vagina or vulva.

Vaginal discharge can also cause confusion, but it usually isn't clear or watery, and often presents with other symptoms such as itching or burning, which are not reported here.

Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) presents with sudden leakage of clear fluid and is a strong possibility. The absence of contractions might point against it, but contractions often start after the rupture. The clear fluid in the cervical canal and the ferning pattern on the glass slide (indicative of amniotic fluid) strongly suggests PROM.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is premature rupture of membranes.",Premature Rupture of Membranes,Y,"The patient presents with sudden leakage of clear fluid from her vagina at 38 weeks' gestation. This, along with the presence of ferning pattern in the fluid when placed onto a glass slide, is suggestive of amniotic fluid, indicating that her membranes have ruptured.

While it could lead to labor, the absence of contractions in this case indicates that labor has not yet started.",Premature rupture of membranes (PROM),Y,"This patient is experiencing sudden leakage of clear fluid from her vagina, which upon examination shows a ferning pattern. This ""ferning"" is a classic sign of amniotic fluid. Additionally, her gestational age is at term (38 weeks), which makes it likely that her membranes have ruptured spontaneously, a process which naturally occurs when the pregnancy reaches term and labor is about to begin or has begun. This rupture of the membranes is also called ""water breaking."" Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM).",Spontaneous rupture of membranes,Y,"The prior probability of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is fairly high in this situation given the clear fluid leakage from the vagina. This accounts for about 30% of such cases in the third trimester. After verifying the fluid leakage as the clear fluid from the vagina (amniotic fluid), the posterior probability of PROM increases to about 85%. The observation of ferning, a pattern formed by amniotic fluid when it's allowed to dry on a glass slide, further confirms the presence of amniotic fluid and increases the probability of PROM to near certainty, i.e., 98%.",Premature rupture of membranes,Y

The laboratory analysis shows a slightly decreased erythrocyte count and hemoglobin level, which are consistent with the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. These changes are due to the physiological hemodilution that occurs as the plasma volume increases more rapidly than the red cell mass, a condition often referred to as ""physiological anemia of pregnancy."" Her mean corpuscular volume (MCV), serum iron, and ferritin levels are within normal ranges, which rules out conditions like iron deficiency anemia.",Physiological anemia of pregnancy,Y,"The differential for this pregnant patient's changes in blood count includes iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and physiological changes due to pregnancy.

Anemia in pregnancy is common and could be caused by various factors such as increased blood volume leading to dilutional anemia, dietary changes, or increased iron requirements. Her low erythrocyte count and hemoglobin indicate anemia, however, the MCV is normal which makes B12 or folate deficiency less likely. Also, her serum iron and ferritin are within normal limits, so iron deficiency anemia is also less likely.

Additionally, the patient's leukocyte count is within normal limits, so anemia of chronic disease is less likely.

Considering all these factors, the most likely cause of the changes in the patient's blood count is physiological anemia of pregnancy, which is a normal response to increased blood volume and increased demand for red blood cells during pregnancy. It's characterized by dilutional effect due to the increase in plasma volume exceeding the increase in red blood cell mass, resulting in reduced hemoglobin and hematocrit.",Physiological anemia of pregnancy,Y,"This patient is a pregnant woman presenting with signs of mild anemia. The hallmark of normal pregnancy is a physiologic anemia due to an increase in plasma volume which exceeds the increase in red cell mass, leading to a decrease in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. This is also known as ""dilutional"" or ""physiological"" anemia of pregnancy. The findings in this patient (Hb 11.9 g/dL, HCT 35%, normal MCV, normal ferritin level) are consistent with this condition. It's also worth noting that the systolic ejection murmur is a normal finding in pregnancy due to increased blood volume and flow. So, the changes in the patient's blood count are likely due to physiological changes associated with pregnancy.",Pregnancy-related physiological changes.,Y,"The patient is in her early pregnancy and presenting with symptoms like malaise and nausea, which are common in early pregnancy. The blood count shows a slightly decreased hemoglobin level, which is typical during pregnancy due to the physiological increase in plasma volume (also known as dilutional anemia of pregnancy). This is not severe enough to be classified as true anemia. The platelet count is normal, and the leukocyte count is within normal limits. Also, her serum iron and ferritin levels are within normal limits, suggesting no iron deficiency anemia. The murmur along the left sternal border could be due to the increase in blood volume during pregnancy, causing the heart to work harder and sometimes leading to the development of an innocent heart murmur.",Physiological changes of pregnancy,Y,"We begin with the base rates for different conditions that could be causing the changes in the blood count of this pregnant woman.

Iron-deficiency anemia: This is a common condition in pregnant women. However, in this case, the patient's serum iron and ferritin levels are normal, which significantly decreases the likelihood of this condition.
Thalassemia: This is a common genetic disorder that can cause microcytic anemia. However, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is normal (85 fL), making thalassemia less likely.
Pregnancy-related changes: During pregnancy, the blood volume increases, leading to a physiological dilutional anemia, which can explain the drop in hemoglobin level and erythrocyte count. This is a normal occurrence during pregnancy, and as such, has a high prior probability.
Hemodilution: As the blood volume increases in pregnancy, there can be a relative decrease in the concentration of blood cells, including erythrocytes. The high platelet count (210,000/mm3), normal leukocyte count (7800/mm3), and low reticulocyte count (0.2%) in this patient all suggest that there is not an active process of bone marrow stimulation or suppression.
In conclusion, this Bayesian inference leads to the conclusion that the changes in the patient's blood count are most likely due to the normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, including hemodilution.",Pregnancy-related changes,Y
"A 72-year-old man presents to the ED complaining of worsening abdominal pain over the last few hours. He also reports nausea, but denies fever, vomiting, or changes in the appearance of his bowel movements. His medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, atrial fibrillation, and peptic ulcer disease. Due to his recurrent bleeding peptic ulcers, he does not take warfarin. His surgical history is significant for an appendectomy as a child. His medications include metformin, lisinopril, metoprolol, and omeprazole. He has a 50-pack-year history of smoking. His temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F), blood pressure is 146/80 mm Hg, pulse is 115/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min. On physical exam, he is in acute distress due to the pain. Pulmonary auscultation reveals scattered wheezes and decreased air entry. His heart rate is irregularly irregular, with no murmurs, rubs or gallops. Abdominal exam is significant for decreased bowel sounds and diffuse tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation is as follows:
Na 138 mEq/L, Cl 101 mEq/L, HCO3 12 mEq/L, BUN 21 mg/dL, Cr 0.9 mg/dL, glucose 190 mg/dL, amylase 240 U/L (normal < 65 U/L).
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Acute mesenteric ischemia,Acute pancreatitis,N,Acute pancreatitis,N,Acute pancreatitis.,N,Pancreatitis,N,Acute pancreatitis,N,,"The patient is presenting with acute, worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and is in significant distress. His lab results show a notably high amylase level, which is suggestive of an issue with the pancreas, as the pancreas produces amylase. When combined with the clinical presentation, this high amylase level strongly suggests acute pancreatitis. Other signs that could point towards pancreatitis include the patient's history of alcoholism (evidenced by a 50-pack-year smoking history), type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.

Additionally, the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease may have contributed to the development of pancreatitis. Although the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis is multifactorial, certain medications and medical conditions (like peptic ulcer disease) may contribute to the disease.

Further, the decrease in bowel sounds on abdominal examination may be due to paralytic ileus, a common complication of acute pancreatitis. The irregularly irregular heart rate can be associated with his known history of atrial fibrillation.

The patient's other laboratory values (including Na, Cl, BUN, Cr, glucose) are abnormal but can be explained by his chronic medical conditions (including type 2 diabetes and hypertension) and are not specific for pancreatitis. The low bicarbonate level may be an indication of metabolic acidosis, which can occur in acute pancreatitis due to poor perfusion and subsequent lactic acidosis, or due to the release of acidic pancreatic fluids.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is acute pancreatitis.",Acute pancreatitis.,N,"The differential for this patient could include acute pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, acute cholecystitis, gastric or duodenal ulcers, or acute myocardial infarction. His history of peptic ulcer disease might suggest another ulcer episode, however, the overall clinical picture does not quite fit with his prior history. Acute pancreatitis could present with upper abdominal pain and elevated amylase, but typically is associated with a history of heavy alcohol use or gallstones, neither of which is mentioned in this case. An acute myocardial infarction can present with abdominal pain, but it is less likely given the absence of chest pain, shortness of breath, or electrocardiogram changes.

His symptoms and physical exam, particularly the diffuse abdominal tenderness and decreased bowel sounds, combined with his history of atrial fibrillation (even though he is not anticoagulated due to peptic ulcers), make mesenteric ischemia a concern. Patients with atrial fibrillation are at risk of thromboembolic events, which can include emboli to the mesenteric arteries. The presence of an elevated amylase might be secondary to ischemia-related damage to the pancreas.

Thus, considering his history, risk factors, and clinical presentation, this patient most likely has mesenteric ischemia.",Mesenteric Ischemia,Y,"This patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, history of smoking, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm, indicative of atrial fibrillation, raises concern for mesenteric ischemia. The abdominal pain in mesenteric ischemia is often severe, out of proportion to physical examination findings, as seen in this patient. Atrial fibrillation can cause formation of clots that can embolize to the superior mesenteric artery leading to ischemia. The elevated amylase is consistent with pancreatic or bowel inflammation secondary to ischemia. Absence of significant metabolic acidosis does not rule out the condition as it can be a later sign. His age and cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation) make this diagnosis more likely.",Mesenteric ischemia,Y,"This patient's abdominal pain, decreased bowel sounds, and markedly elevated amylase are strongly suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The pain of pancreatitis is typically constant and severe, often radiating to the back, and associated with nausea. Reduced bowel sounds and tenderness are due to associated ileus. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol abuse, but there are many other potential causes, including hypertriglyceridemia, medications, infection, and trauma. Given this patient's history of smoking and the acute onset of his symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis.",Acute Pancreatitis,N,"The prior probability of acute pancreatitis in the general population is around 0.04% in the US. However, this patient presents with worsening abdominal pain and nausea, which increases the posterior probability of pancreatitis to about 5%. He also has significantly elevated amylase levels which increases the likelihood further to about 30%. His history of heavy smoking and type 2 diabetes can both contribute to the risk of pancreatitis, pushing the posterior probability further to around 70%. His age and cardiovascular comorbidities could increase the risk even more, since pancreatic diseases are more common in the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the absence of findings suggesting other diagnoses such as appendicitis or cholecystitis make pancreatitis more likely. Taken together, the patient's symptoms, lab results, and history make acute pancreatitis the most probable diagnosis.",Acute pancreatitis,N

However, it's also important to remember that adolescence is a time of significant change and development, and it's not uncommon for teenagers to have conflicts with parents or changes in social preferences.

While these could be symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), substance use disorder, or a mood disorder, these changes can also be part of the normal adolescent development, which includes establishing independence from parents and an increase in peer influence. As such, it is essential to differentiate normal adolescent behavior from psychiatric pathology. In this case, the patient denies any severe psychiatric symptoms like suicidal ideation, and she doesn't exhibit signs of substance use, impulsivity, inattention, hyperactivity, or significant mood swings. Therefore, her symptoms seem to be more indicative of normal adolescent behavior.",Normal adolescent behavior.,Y,"This teenage girl is presenting with declining academic performance, irritability, social isolation, and conflict with her mother.

She may be struggling with the increased demands of high school, both academically and socially, but it does not appear to be due to an attention disorder as she does not have problems with attention mentioned and seems to prefer learning through online videos, which requires focus. Moreover, the mother's complaints and the patient's frustration suggest the presence of familial conflicts. Given her age, it is also possible that hormonal changes associated with puberty are contributing to her mood and behavior. Overall, this pattern of symptoms is more suggestive of an adjustment disorder, a condition that can occur in response to stressful life changes, resulting in emotional or behavioral symptoms. This condition usually presents within three months of the stressor�in this case, transitioning to high school�and can manifest as conduct disturbances, mood disturbances, and/or disturbances of other emotions and behaviors.

The patient's argument with her mother and general discontent with her peers is common in adolescence, which raises the probability of typical adolescent behavior to around 75%. She has no signs of substance abuse, self-harm, or danger to others, which may decrease the probability of a psychiatric disorder and again increase the likelihood of typical adolescent behavior.

Repression is an unconscious mechanism employed to keep disturbing or threatening thoughts from becoming conscious, which could be a possibility, but he does not seem to be unaware of his mother's death. Projection involves attributing one�s own feelings to others, which is also not evident in this scenario. Rationalization is putting something into a different light or offering a different explanation for one's perceptions or behaviors in the face of a changing reality, which also doesn't appear to be present.

The defense mechanism that seems most likely in this situation is sublimation. Sublimation involves channeling unacceptable feelings or impulses into more acceptable ones. Here, the patient is using sports and his focus on making the starting lineup as a means to deal with the grief and loss of his mother. This allows him to avoid confronting his sorrow directly, instead pouring that emotional energy into his sports performance. So, this patient is most likely exhibiting the defense mechanism of sublimation.",Sublimation,N,"The patient's response indicates two main defense mechanisms: denial and sublimation. Denial is a primary defense mechanism, where a person refuses to accept reality or facts to protect the ego from things that the individual cannot cope with. In this case, the patient immediately changes the subject when asked about his mother, indicating he might be denying his feelings about her death. Sublimation, on the other hand, is a mature defense mechanism where unacceptable impulses or idealizations are unconsciously transformed into socially acceptable actions or behavior. The patient's focus on baseball tryouts, using the sport as a channel for his feelings about his mother's death, demonstrates this mechanism.","Denial and Sublimation



",N,"The patient's response of quickly changing the subject when asked about his mother, who died recently of ovarian cancer, suggests the use of defense mechanisms to cope with the emotional distress associated with her death. Specifically, he is demonstrating two primary defense mechanisms: avoidance and sublimation. Avoidance is the refusal to acknowledge or deal with the painful aspect of reality - in this case, the patient's mother's death. Instead, he quickly changes the topic to something more positive, such as his excitement for baseball tryouts. Sublimation is when he transforms his grief into a socially acceptable activity - his enthusiasm and focus on baseball. This allows him to deal with his loss in a way that also fosters his personal growth and community engagement.",Avoidance and Sublimation,N,"In the case of this 17-year-old boy, we can apply the principles of Bayesian inference to deduce the most likely psychological defense mechanisms at play.

The prior probability of any specific defense mechanism being used is not known, but we can look at the details provided and see how they update our likelihood for each possible mechanism. In this case, the boy's reaction to the question about his mother suggests he's uncomfortable addressing her death, which points towards some form of avoidance.

Denial: This mechanism involves refusing to accept reality or facts. The boy, however, is not outright denying his mother's death, he simply avoids the topic. So this possibility increases only slightly, say to 20%.

Displacement: This involves shifting emotional responses from one source to another less threatening source. There isn't clear evidence for this, so the probability remains low, perhaps at 10%.

Repression: This involves unconsciously pushing unwanted memories from awareness. This seems more likely given the boy's behavior, so this possibility increases, say to 40%.

Reaction formation: This involves changing unacceptable thoughts or feelings into their opposites, which doesn't seem applicable here, so this probability remains low, perhaps at 10%.

Sublimation: This involves channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable actions or behaviors. The boy is redirecting his thoughts and conversation towards baseball, which could be seen as a form of this. So this possibility increases, say to 30%.

Taking these updates into account, the most likely defense mechanisms at play here seem to be repression, as he seems to be avoiding the uncomfortable reality of his mother's death, and sublimation, as he's focusing his energy on baseball instead.","Repression, Sublimation",N

These symptoms, together with hypertension and tachycardia, are suggestive of a black widow spider bite. The black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans) is native to the region and is often found in undisturbed locations like sheds. Its bite can cause severe muscle pain, abdominal cramping, hypertension, and tachycardia due to the neurotoxic venom it produces.","Black Widow Spider



",Y,"The differential for the arthropod causing this patient's symptoms could include a spider (black widow or brown recluse), tick, or scorpion, among others. Given the geographical location (Virginia), and the symptoms of severe muscle cramping, abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypertension, and a single area of erythema (indicating a bite), this most likely points to a black widow spider. The black widow spider's venom contains alpha-latrotoxin, which leads to neurotransmitter release, causing symptoms of autonomic instability like hypertension and tachycardia, as well as severe muscle cramping. The lack of necrotic or ulcerated skin lesion rules out brown recluse spider. Scorpion stings are usually accompanied by neurological symptoms, which are not present here. Tick bites often cause a characteristic bullseye rash and present with different systemic symptoms.",Black Widow Spider,Y,"This child has muscle cramping, abdominal pain, tachycardia, hypertension, and localized erythema at the site of a recent bite. The sudden onset of these symptoms following a bite and the geographical location (Virginia) suggest a bite from a black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans).

These spiders are found throughout the United States, including in Virginia. The erythema on the hand where the bite occurred is another typical sign. The venom of the black widow spider contains a neurotoxin that leads to the release of neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and norepinephrine, which can cause the symptoms seen in this patient, including muscle cramping and autonomic dysregulation leading to hypertension and tachycardia.",Black widow spider.,Y,"The prior probability of a Black Widow Spider bite is relatively low, especially given the general population of Virginia and a lack of specific bite identification from the child or parents. However, considering the symptom profile, the probabilities change. The incidence of severe muscle cramping and abdominal pain following an insect bite, coupled with the location of exposure (an outdoor shed), increases the posterior probability of a Black Widow Spider bite to around 30%. With the addition of the local erythematous reaction seen on the hand, the probability raises further to around 50%. Including the presence of hypertension and tachycardia, symptoms characteristic of the systemic response to a Black Widow Spider bite due to its neurotoxic venom, the probability increases to over 80%.

The significantly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are suggestive of hepatic injury or dysfunction. Acetaminophen overdose is a common cause of acute liver failure, as the drug is primarily metabolized in the liver and can cause hepatotoxicity in high amounts. The liver damage results from the formation of a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which is normally detoxified by glutathione. However, in an overdose situation, the glutathione stores become depleted, leading to accumulation of NAPQI and hepatocellular injury.","Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity



",N,"The differential for this patient includes acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, sepsis, drug intoxication (e.g., acetaminophen overdose), and alcoholic hepatitis.

Considering the patient's history of substance abuse, presentation with loss of consciousness, and findings next to a bottle of acetaminophen, it is quite possible that the patient attempted suicide by overdosing on acetaminophen. Furthermore, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) levels are extremely elevated, a classic finding in acute liver injury, especially due to acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen is metabolized in the liver, and in high doses can lead to liver necrosis.

In addition, while the patient's BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine are mildly elevated, suggesting possible acute kidney injury, this could be due to prerenal causes such as hypovolemia or decreased renal perfusion, which could be secondary to the liver failure and sepsis, given his unstable vitals and broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. The presence of alcohol in the toxicology report further supports the liver as the origin of the abnormal lab values. It's worth noting that alcohol can potentiate the hepatotoxic effects of acetaminophen.

It's less likely that the lab abnormalities are due to HIV or hepatitis C. While these conditions can certainly cause liver injury over time, they would not lead to such a rapid and severe rise in liver enzymes.",Acetaminophen overdose,N,"This patient has significantly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), which is suggestive of acute liver injury. The history of being found next to a bottle of acetaminophen raises high suspicion for an acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen overdose is a common cause of acute liver failure. The body metabolizes acetaminophen in the liver, where in large quantities, it can lead to the buildup of a toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI can cause severe liver injury, which is represented in the significantly elevated liver transaminases (AST and ALT) found in this patient's lab results. It should also be noted that the patient's BUN and creatinine levels are mildly elevated, suggesting potential renal impairment, which could be another consequence of an acetaminophen overdose.",Acetaminophen overdose,N,"This patient was found unconscious near a bottle of acetaminophen, which suggests a potential overdose of this medication. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose is a common cause of acute liver injury. The liver is responsible for the metabolism of acetaminophen, and in cases of overdose, the excessive amount of the drug can cause a build-up of a toxic metabolite (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) that can lead to liver cell damage, necrosis, and in severe cases, acute liver failure. This is consistent with the markedly elevated levels of AST and ALT seen in the lab results, which are indicative of significant hepatocellular injury. The patient's signs of alcohol abuse could also contribute to the liver injury, as alcohol and acetaminophen both are metabolized in the liver and their combined effect can be synergistic in causing liver damage. The BUN and creatinine levels indicate some degree of kidney dysfunction, which could be secondary to liver injury, or could be due to another cause such as dehydration or sepsis (the latter could also explain the initial fever and tachycardia).","Acetaminophen overdose-induced hepatotoxicity



",N,"The prior probability of acute liver injury is high given the presentation of the patient who was found with a bottle of acetaminophen and the lab results.
Acetaminophen overdose, whether intentional or accidental, is a common cause of acute liver failure, which is indicated by elevated liver enzymes such as AST and ALT.

The prior probability of acetaminophen overdose causing acute liver injury in this case could be estimated at 60% due to the circumstances.
The patient's past medical history of substance abuse, non-compliance with medications, and a previous suicide attempt further increase the likelihood of intentional or unintentional overdose, pushing the posterior probability to 80%.
The significantly elevated AST and ALT levels (in thousands, when the normal range is generally less than 50 U/L) further increase the posterior probability of acute liver injury due to acetaminophen overdose to 90%.

Therefore, Parkinson's disease is the most likely diagnosis.","Parkinson's disease.



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease).

This patient is presenting with a resting tremor, bradykinesia (resistance to passive movement of his upper extremities), hypomimia (reduced facial expressions), and soft speech. These symptoms align with the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease, which are tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. Furthermore, he has some cognitive impairment which is often seen in later stages of Parkinson's disease.

Essential tremor could present with similar symptoms, but it is usually an action tremor and doesn't typically present with the bradykinesia, hypomimia, or cognitive impairment.

Drug-induced parkinsonism is less likely because the patient's medications (aspirin and amlodipine) are not known to cause this condition.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus usually presents with gait disturbances, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment - this doesn't fit as well with this patient's presentation.

Finally, dementia (such as Alzheimer's disease) could account for the cognitive impairment, but it wouldn't typically present with the movement abnormalities described.

While memory problems aren't typically the first symptom of Parkinson's, cognitive changes including problems with memory can occur, especially as the disease progresses.","Parkinson's Disease



",Y,"This patient presents with a resting tremor that is more pronounced on one side, bradykinesia evidenced by his soft speech and reduced facial expressions, and rigidity shown by his resistance to manipulation of the upper extremities. These symptoms are consistent with Parkinson's disease. The fact that the tremor worsens when the patient is trying to relax is also a classic sign of Parkinson's, as it is a ""resting tremor"" which tends to be more noticeable when the patient is not using the affected muscle.

Given his history of anabolic steroid use, smoking, and alcohol consumption, the patient has several risk factors for malignancy. A high index of suspicion for neoplastic disease is warranted in this case. Given the loss of sensation, strength, and pain specifically located in one arm, a Pancoast tumor (a type of lung cancer located at the top of the lung) should be considered. Pancoast tumors can cause such symptoms due to their location at the top of the lung where they can invade the brachial plexus and cause a group of symptoms known as Pancoast syndrome, which includes shoulder pain, arm weakness and sensory disturbances, and Horner's syndrome (which may not be presented in this case).","Pancoast tumor



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: peripheral neuropathy, stroke, spinal cord compression, musculoskeletal injury, and peripheral vascular disease. Given his past medical history of diabetes, peripheral neuropathy is a possible cause; however, the acute and localized nature of the symptoms is more suggestive of focal neurological damage than a systemic disease. His use of anabolic steroids and significant weight loss raises suspicion of a malignancy which could lead to spinal cord compression. The hypertension and smoking history could predispose him to a stroke, but weakness is isolated to the right arm which makes this less likely. The dull aching and burning pain, along with the weakness and decreased sensation in the right arm, points to a potential nerve compression or nerve damage issue. Considering his history of anabolic steroid use, bodybuilding, and recent weight loss, one possibility is that he has a tumor causing nerve compression. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is a brachial plexus injury possibly due to a tumor (likely lung cancer given his significant smoking history).","Brachial plexus injury



",N,"This patient's presentation is indicative of a peripheral neuropathy, specifically mononeuropathy given the isolated involvement of the right arm. His history of diabetes could suggest diabetic neuropathy, which typically presents as a polyneuropathy affecting the longest nerves first (i.e., stocking-and-glove distribution), not a mononeuropathy. The patient's significant smoking history, hypertension, and use of anabolic steroids point towards a possible vascular cause such as mononeuritis multiplex. However, the significant weight loss and his history of smoking heavily favor a malignancy. The isolated weakness and sensory loss in one arm is typical of a Pancoast tumor, a type of lung cancer that develops at the lung's apex and invades the brachial plexus, leading to a clinical syndrome of shoulder and arm pain and weakness.","Pancoast tumor



",Y,"This patient has a few risk factors for peripheral neuropathy, including chronic alcohol use, diabetes, and potential nutritional deficiencies related to weight loss. The presented symptoms suggest a mononeuropathy rather than a polyneuropathy, as only the right arm is affected. The history of anabolic steroid use, weight lifting, and recent weight loss also raise concern for a potential compressive neuropathy, such as a brachial plexopathy. Compressive or traumatic brachial plexopathies can cause weakness, sensory changes, and pain in the affected limb. In this case, the patient's high blood pressure may suggest anabolic steroid abuse is ongoing, which can cause nerve damage due to hypertrophy of the surrounding musculature compressing the nerves. The burning, aching pain, and progressive weakness in the right arm are most consistent with brachial plexopathy.","Brachial Plexopathy



",N,"This patient's symptoms point towards a neurological condition. The prior probability of a peripheral neuropathy, considering the patient's age, diabetic status, and alcohol use is around 10%. The presence of unilateral weakness and numbness increases the likelihood to 20%.

However, in the context of a bodybuilder who admits to anabolic steroid use, the symptoms could also indicate a nerve compression syndrome like a brachial plexopathy, which has a prior probability of around 5%. The ongoing weakness of the right arm, especially with this history, would increase this probability to around 20%.

There is also a potential for a central nervous system issue, such as a stroke. Given the patient's age, smoking history, diabetes, and hypertension, the prior probability of a stroke is around 15%. The focal neurological symptoms (weakness and numbness in the right arm) increases this probability to around 25%.

Given these considerations, and the fact that the strength difference is so marked between the right and left arm, and there is a sensory deficit along with pain, a brachial plexopathy is likely. This could be due to nerve compression or injury related to the bodybuilder's training or steroid use.","Brachial Plexopathy

Additionally, the described diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border indicates a possible involvement of the heart valves, potentially due to infective endocarditis. The prosthetic valve, a foreign body, could serve as a nidus for infection. The ""photograph of his right index finger"" could indicate the presence of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions, which are classical signs of infective endocarditis. Additionally, the leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate indicate an active infection or inflammatory process. The organisms that most commonly cause prosthetic valve endocarditis are Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci. Considering the community setting, the absence of any immediate postoperative symptoms (which would be more likely with S. aureus), and the patient's chronic conditions, Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most likely culprit.","Staphylococcus epidermidis.



",Y,"Given the patient's recent history of aortic prosthetic valve replacement, his current symptoms of fever, nonproductive cough, and lethargy, along with the physical examination finding of a diastolic blowing murmur heard over the left sternal border and radiating to the right sternal border, and the elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, this patient likely has prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE). A key clue also lies in the undisclosed photograph of the right index finger, which, given the context, is likely showing signs of Osler nodes or Janeway lesions, both characteristic of endocarditis.

In terms of organisms that commonly cause PVE, they typically are bacteria, and can be broadly divided into early-onset PVE (within 60 days of surgery) and late-onset PVE (more than 60 days after surgery). Early-onset PVE is most often caused by Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis), and sometimes Gram-negative bacilli. Late-onset PVE is often due to organisms such as Streptococcus viridans, enterococci, and the HACEK group of organisms (Haemophilus species, Aggregatibacter species, Cardiobacterium hominis, Eikenella corrodens, and Kingella species).

Given the timeline (5 weeks post-surgery), this patient would likely fall into the category of early-onset PVE, making Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci the most likely culprits.","Staphylococcus aureus



",N,"The patient's recent history of aortic prosthetic valve replacement, persistent fever, and presence of a diastolic murmur are all indicative of infective endocarditis. In particular, the appearance of a diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border radiating to the right can indicate aortic valve involvement, which is in line with the recent surgery. Additionally, the patient's lethargy, raised leukocyte count, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate all point towards a systemic infection.

The presence of rales on lung auscultation can suggest embolic phenomena from vegetations on the heart valves, and splinter hemorrhages could potentially be observed on the fingernails, which are characteristic but not specific for infective endocarditis.

The most common causal organisms of prosthetic valve endocarditis can be divided into early and late onset. Early onset (within 60 days of surgery) is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci, which are introduced during the operation. Late onset (more than 60 days after surgery) is most commonly due to Streptococcus species, Enterococcus species, or Staphylococcus epidermidis. Given that it's been 5 weeks (35 days) post surgery, the most likely organisms in this scenario are Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci.","Staphylococcus species.



",Y,"The patient's symptoms and recent medical history strongly suggest an infection of his aortic prosthetic valve, a condition known as prosthetic valve endocarditis. His signs and symptoms of fever, non-productive cough, fatigue, myalgia, difficulty breathing, and lethargy are all consistent with a systemic infection. Furthermore, the description of the diastolic blowing murmur radiating to the right sternal border is suggestive of aortic regurgitation, which could be due to a failing prosthetic valve as a result of infection. Additionally, the patient's elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate both indicate an ongoing inflammatory process, which would be expected in endocarditis. The mention of the patient's right index finger possibly hints at the presence of Osler's nodes or Janeway lesions, both of which are indicative of endocarditis.

In terms of identifying the most likely causal organism, the most common pathogens for prosthetic valve endocarditis are Staphylococci and Streptococci species. However, in early-onset prosthetic valve endocarditis (within 2 months of surgery, as in this case), Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis), often originating from the skin flora, are more common. Given that this patient underwent valve replacement 5 weeks ago and given the prevalence of these organisms in the etiology of early prosthetic valve endocarditis, the most likely causal organism would be a Staphylococcus species.",Staphylococcus species.,Y,"Step 1: The patient recently underwent aortic prosthetic valve replacement. The prior probability of infective endocarditis after such a procedure is relatively high.

Step 2: The patient presents with fever, nonproductive cough, and a new diastolic murmur - symptoms which are consistent with infective endocarditis, increasing the probability of this condition.

Step 3: Given the description of a photograph of the patient's right index finger, we might assume the presence of some abnormality like Janeway lesions or Osler's nodes, which are also signs associated with infective endocarditis, further increasing the probability.

Step 4: The presence of rales and elevated leukocyte count indicate infection or inflammation. This, along with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, is consistent with systemic infection or inflammation, further increasing the likelihood of infective endocarditis.

Step 5: Considering the fact that the patient is a chronic smoker and has recently undergone heart surgery, his susceptibility to bacterial infections, particularly Staphylococcus aureus (which is the leading cause of infective endocarditis in individuals with prosthetic valves), is significantly increased.

Overall, the posterior probability that this patient's symptoms are due to Staphylococcus aureus infective endocarditis is very high.",Staphylococcus aureus,N

His past history of incarceration and the findings of hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and diffuse crackles throughout the lung fields could be suggestive of a number of diseases, including tuberculosis or fungal infection. However, a negative tuberculin skin test makes tuberculosis less likely. The unique feature that helps narrow the diagnosis is the presence of yellowish lesions in the posterior pole of the eyes, which suggests some type of systemic disease with ocular involvement. A common condition that fits this description is disseminated sarcoidosis, a multisystem inflammatory disease which commonly involves the lungs, lymph nodes, and eyes and can present with weight loss, night sweats and fever. The disease frequently results in bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy which could cause diffuse crackles in lungs, and might be seen in the chest X-ray (even though the image is not provided here).","Disseminated Sarcoidosis



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: tuberculosis, non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection, sarcoidosis, metastatic cancer, and disseminated fungal infection.

Tuberculosis, while plausible given his history of imprisonment, would typically present with positive tuberculin skin test (TST), which is not the case in this patient. Furthermore, the presence of diffuse crackles and hepatomegaly is atypical for tuberculosis.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease, which can present with non-specific systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, weight loss and generalized lymphadenopathy. However, the presence of hepatomegaly is less commonly seen in sarcoidosis and the skin test usually comes out as negative.

NTM infection is less likely as they usually present in patients with underlying lung diseases or in immunocompromised individuals, neither of which is the case for this patient.

Metastatic cancer could also present with such findings but the yellowish lesions in the eye are not typical for metastasis and are more commonly seen in fungal infections.

Disseminated fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis or cryptococcosis, can present with systemic symptoms including weight loss, fever, and hepatomegaly. Generalized lymphadenopathy is also common. Furthermore, eye involvement, which can present as choroidal lesions as described, is a known manifestation of disseminated fungal infections. Given his clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is a disseminated fungal infection.",Disseminated fungal infection.,N,"This patient presents with fever, cough, night sweats, and weight loss, which are common symptoms of tuberculosis. However, the negative tuberculin skin test, which has a high false-negative rate in patients with tuberculosis, as well as the history of prison, does not entirely support this diagnosis. He also has hepatomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy, which may suggest a systemic disease like lymphoma, but the absence of the usual B symptoms (night sweats, fever, weight loss) does not strongly support this diagnosis.

The presence of yellow-colored lesions with indistinct borders in the retina is strongly suggestive of choroidal tubercles, which are a hallmark of disseminated tuberculosis. Choroidal tubercles are the most common ocular manifestation of tuberculosis and are usually multiple and bilateral. These findings, along with his history of prison, which increases his risk for tuberculosis, lead to a likely diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis. A chest x-ray is not provided in the question stem, but it is mentioned. In cases of disseminated tuberculosis, the chest x-ray often shows miliary pattern (multiple tiny nodules throughout the lung fields).",Disseminated tuberculosis,Y,"The patient's history of fever, cough, weight loss, night sweats, and poor appetite over the last six months, combined with the physical findings of hepatomegaly and generalized lymphadenopathy, strongly suggest a systemic disease. The presence of diffuse crackles throughout the lung fields could indicate a diffuse lung disease, such as an infection or malignancy. Additionally, the discrete yellow lesions in the posterior pole of the eye could suggest choroid tubercles, which are a classic sign of disseminated tuberculosis (TB), though other systemic diseases can also cause similar findings. The chest X-ray (not shown here) could provide more information and likely confirms the suspicion.

However, the negative tuberculin skin test might seem to argue against TB. It's important to remember, though, that this test can be negative in patients with disseminated TB due to anergy (a state of immune unresponsiveness), particularly in those who are immunosuppressed or malnourished.

The patient's history of recent incarceration further increases the likelihood of TB, as TB is more common in confined populations, including prison inmates.

Taking all these factors into consideration, the patient most likely has disseminated tuberculosis.","Disseminated tuberculosis



",Y,"The patient's presentation includes several clues that can be analyzed using Bayesian inference.

The prior probability for tuberculosis in the general population might be relatively low (let's say 5%), but this probability changes with the given evidence:

Weight loss, night sweats, and fever are all symptoms of tuberculosis. Given these symptoms, the probability of tuberculosis might increase to 15%.

The patient was recently in prison, where TB is more prevalent due to crowded living conditions. This might increase the probability of tuberculosis to 25%.

Auscultation reveals crackles in the lung fields, which can indicate an infectious process like tuberculosis, increasing the likelihood to 35%.

However, the presence of hepatomegaly, generalized lymphadenopathy, and discrete yellow-colored lesions in the eye are not typical for tuberculosis, and a negative tuberculin skin test further decreases the likelihood of tuberculosis, dropping the probability back to 10%.

These symptoms and signs are, however, indicative of a disseminated infection, possibly fungal. The most common systemic fungal infection that would cause this presentation, especially in the context of incarceration where conditions may be suboptimal, is histoplasmosis.

The presence of symptoms like cough and fever (indicative of a respiratory tract infection), hepatomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy (suggesting a systemic infection), the presence of lesions in the eye (histoplasma can cause ocular disease), and his incarceration history (histoplasma is often found in soil and in bird or bat droppings, which could be encountered in less hygienic environments) increase the probability of histoplasmosis.

Therefore, while TB was initially a consideration, the constellation of symptoms, history, and physical exam findings lead us to a more likely diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis.","Disseminated Histoplasmosis

The combination of forceful vomiting and alcoholism puts him at high risk for this condition. The symptoms of Boerhaave syndrome include severe chest pain (usually after vomiting), vomiting up blood, and signs of shock. In this patient, the crunching sound heard on chest auscultation (Hamman's sign) and the presence of free mediastinal air on chest X-ray support the diagnosis. Hamman's sign is specific to mediastinal emphysema which typically results from esophageal perforation. The esophagus lacks a serosal layer, making it vulnerable to perforation, and forceful vomiting can lead to transmural rupture.","Boerhaave syndrome



",Y,"The prior probability of Boerhaave syndrome (spontaneous esophageal rupture) is generally low in the general population, perhaps less than 0.1%.

Signs of potential liver disease in this patient include the presence of spider angiomas on his skin (which can occur in liver disease), large hematoma and numerous bruises (suggesting a bleeding tendency), and an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which is often seen in alcohol-induced macrocytic anemia.

Furthermore, the lab results reveal abnormal coagulation profile with prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, both indicative of a coagulopathy, which aligns with impaired liver function.

The patient's left-sided flank pain and the finding of a hematoma on the left flank could be due to a retroperitoneal hematoma, possibly resulting from a minor trauma or spontaneous due to coagulopathy. This condition can also cause referred pain to the hip area, which could explain why the patient complains of pain when his left hip is extended.

The patient's history of multiple admissions for alcohol withdrawal, the presence of spider angiomas (a sign of liver disease), and the prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) suggest a coagulopathy related to liver disease. Medications such as cefepime and morphine don't typically cause coagulopathy, making this less likely. The well-healing incision suggests that the surgical site is not the primary issue. Hematoma and bruising, alongside the increased bleeding times, indicate an issue with coagulation. The high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a common finding in alcohol misuse, indicating macrocytic anemia, which further suggests an alcohol-related condition.

Liver disease impairs synthesis of coagulation factors leading to prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time. Additionally, alcoholism is associated with macrocytic anemia, as seen here with MCV of 102 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL), due to folate and vitamin B12 deficiency or direct toxic effect of alcohol on the bone marrow. The left-sided flank pain may be due to the hematoma formed as a result of the coagulation disorder.

",Y,"The prior probability of a coagulopathy condition is given a default value, such as 1% (although this is an arbitrary starting point and not based on an actual statistical average).

The first piece of data we consider is the patient's history of multiple admissions for alcohol withdrawal. This increases the posterior probability of a coagulopathy related to liver disease (as alcohol can harm the liver, affecting its ability to produce clotting factors) to perhaps 20%.

Next, we note the scattered spider angiomas on skin examination. Spider angiomas are often associated with liver disease, further increasing the probability to perhaps 50%.

We also have to consider the large hematoma on the left flank and numerous bruises over the abdomen and extremities. This evidence of bleeding increases the posterior probability of a coagulopathy, pushing it to around 70%.

The laboratory studies show abnormalities including a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), prolonged prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time. These abnormalities are consistent with a bleeding disorder due to decreased production of clotting factors, often seen in liver disease. These lab findings might push our posterior probability to 90%.

Finally, considering the patient's abdominal pain and the fact that he has been on bowel rest since admission, it's possible that he has some post-operative complications. But since the pain is localized to the flank and not generalized, and the laboratory findings strongly support a coagulopathy, we assign a higher probability to the coagulopathy.","Liver Disease Coagulopathy

The enlarged spleen, or splenomegaly, can be due to a vaso-occlusive crisis, which is characteristic of sickle cell disease. This crisis is caused by the sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking the flow of blood in the spleen. The resulting ischemia can cause a functional asplenia, which in turn can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria.

",Y,"The prior probability of splenic sequestration crisis in a child with sickle cell disease (SS-hemoglobin) is relatively high. An enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) further increases the probability of this diagnosis. Pale palms and conjunctivae suggest anemia, which is common in splenic sequestration crisis as blood becomes trapped in the spleen. Despite the anemia, the haptoglobin level is normal, which is consistent with this diagnosis since haptoglobin is usually unchanged in splenic sequestration crisis (as opposed to decreased in hemolytic anemia). Therefore, taking all these factors into account, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a splenic sequestration crisis.",Splenic sequestration crisis.,Y

The organisms that usually cause osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease are Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus. However, the radiographic finding of a central sclerotic lesion with a lucent rim over the right lateral malleolus, known as a Brodie's abscess, is more characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus osteomyelitis.

",N,"This child has a history of sickle cell disease, which predisposes him to certain types of infections due to functional asplenia (spleen's inability to filter out and kill certain bacteria). The clinical presentation is consistent with osteomyelitis, characterized by fever, bone pain, and localized findings on examination. Radiologic findings also suggest osteomyelitis. The most common organisms causing osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease are Salmonella species and Staphylococcus aureus. Given that a biopsy and culture confirm the diagnosis, this means the pathogen is likely bacterial and, in the context of sickle cell disease, Salmonella is more uniquely associated than Staphylococcus aureus.",Salmonella,Y,"The patient's history of sickle cell disease makes him more susceptible to certain types of infections, particularly encapsulated organisms like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. However, given the presentation, we need to consider osteomyelitis, which is a common complication in children with sickle cell disease. The typical cause of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease is Salmonella species, because their vascular occlusions from sickling predispose to Salmonella septicemia and subsequent osteomyelitis. The radiological findings also support the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Therefore, the most likely causal organism in this case is Salmonella.",Salmonella,Y,"The patient's presenting symptoms and history offer multiple clues that we can use to update our prior probabilities and guide us toward a probable diagnosis.

Prior probability: In a patient with sickle cell disease, osteomyelitis is a common complication, often caused by Salmonella or Staphylococcus aureus. Given the normal population, the prior probability for either organism causing osteomyelitis is roughly equal.

Update 1: Considering the patient's sickle cell disease, the posterior probability for Salmonella causing osteomyelitis increases because sickle cell patients are particularly susceptible to Salmonella infections. This may increase the probability to about 60%.

Update 2: The patient's X-ray shows signs typical of osteomyelitis such as periosteal thickening and elevation, along with a central sclerotic lesion. These are common in bacterial infections, but do not specify between Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. This does not significantly change the posterior probability.

Update 3: The history of a previous episode of dactylitis further increases the likelihood of Salmonella being the cause. Dactylitis (painful swelling of a digit) is a common manifestation in sickle cell patients and can be a result of vaso-occlusive crisis, but can also suggest a susceptibility to infection such as osteomyelitis. This may increase the posterior probability of Salmonella to about 75%.

Assuming the bone biopsy culture is positive, and based on the likelihood ratios for the specific features observed in this patient, the most probable causal organism of osteomyelitis in this case would be Salmonella.",Salmonella,Y

NPH is characterized by an excess accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles that occurs even if the CSF pressure remains normal. It can result in the ""triad"" of symptoms: gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence.

",Y,"The differential for this patient includes conditions that could cause gait changes, memory problems and urinary incontinence, such as: Alzheimer's disease, Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), Parkinson's disease, Vascular dementia, and Multiple system atrophy. Alzheimer's typically presents with memory problems first, Parkinson's disease would typically have more motor symptoms like resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia which are not mentioned. Multiple system atrophy can be ruled out because it tends to involve more systems than mentioned in this scenario. Vascular dementia typically comes with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks, which is not mentioned. Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) presents with the classic triad of gait abnormalities, cognitive decline (particularly short-term memory loss), and urinary incontinence, which matches this patient's presentation. Also, this condition can be confirmed with an MRI showing ventriculomegaly (enlarged ventricles) with normal pressures, which is hinted in the scenario. Therefore, this patient most likely has Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH).
",Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus,Y,"The patient has presented with difficulty walking (especially initiating steps), memory problems, and issues with bladder control. These symptoms are suggestive of a disorder that affects both the motor and cognitive functioning of an individual. Parkinson's disease could be considered given the family history, but the rapid onset of memory problems suggests a different condition. An important detail in the question is the MRI of the head, but without an image or description of it, it's hard to be certain about a particular diagnosis. However, considering the patient's age, and the combination of motor and cognitive symptoms, a likely diagnosis could be normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence, and is usually associated with ventriculomegaly on brain imaging.",Normal pressure hydrocephalus,Y,"Given the patient's symptoms of slow gait, difficulty initiating steps, forgetfulness, and urgency incontinence, it appears that he may have a condition called Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). These symptoms form a triad that is characteristic of NPH, which includes gait disturbance, dementia, and urinary incontinence. MRI findings in NPH typically show ventricular enlargement out of proportion to the degree of cortical atrophy. The underlying cause of these symptoms is the abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, or cavities, leading to pressure on the brain that affects its functioning.",Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus,Y,"Based on the presented symptoms and the patient's age, the prior probability for neurodegenerative disease is relatively high. As the patient is showing signs of gait difficulty, memory issues, and urinary incontinence, this suggests a disease affecting the brain's control over motor and cognitive functions.

Parkinson's disease could initially seem plausible due to the gait difficulty and the family history; this would potentially increase the probability to around 40%. However, Parkinson's disease is less associated with early-stage confusion or memory deficits and urinary incontinence, so the lack of these typical symptoms reduces the posterior probability somewhat.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is another possibility. This condition is characterized by the triad of gait abnormalities, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment, which matches our patient's symptoms. These key symptoms increase the posterior probability of NPH significantly, perhaps to around 70-80%. Furthermore, an MRI (although not provided here) could potentially show ventricular enlargement without significant cortical atrophy, which would support the diagnosis of NPH.

Another possible diagnosis is dementia, given the memory deficits and confusion. However, the gait difficulty and urinary incontinence are less typical early symptoms for most dementias, which would reduce the posterior probability for this diagnosis.

Therefore, without the MRI to confirm, it's hard to provide a definitive answer. However, given the patient's age, symptom triad, and the Bayesian inference based on the relative likelihood of various diagnoses, the most probable diagnosis would be Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus.","Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus

Toxoplasmosis is a common cause of focal neurologic deficits and seizures in patients with advanced HIV. But, in this case, the patient's brain MRI shows non-enhancing white matter lesions without mass effect, which is not typical for toxoplasmosis. Also, toxoplasmosis typically presents with focal neurological deficits, which the patient does not have.

Cryptococcosis often presents with signs of meningitis such as fever, headache, neck stiffness, and neurologic signs like confusion or altered mental status. The cryptococcal antigen test is negative in this case, making this diagnosis less likely.

HIV encephalopathy, also known as AIDS dementia complex, is a potential consideration given the patient's cognitive changes and motor symptoms. However, the MRI findings of nonenhancing white matter lesions are not typically seen in HIV encephalopathy, which usually presents with cortical atrophy and ventricular enlargement.

This condition, which results from a genetic mutation causing abnormal hemoglobin structure (HbS), leads to the deformation and rigidity of red blood cells under deoxygenating conditions. These ""sickle"" shaped cells can lead to vaso-occlusive episodes, which can manifest as bone pain (as it seems to be the case here). The normochromic, normocytic anemia and high reticulocyte count are consistent with the hemolytic anemia seen in sickle cell disease. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms, blood smear findings, and assuming the electrophoresis shows high levels of HbS, sickle cell disease is the most likely cause of this patient�s condition.",Sickle Cell Disease,Y,"The differential for this patient includes sickle cell disease, thalassemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, and hereditary spherocytosis. The patient's symptoms of recurrent bone pain, jaundice, and severe anemia are indicative of a hemolytic condition, where the body destroys red blood cells faster than it can produce them.

The patient's complete blood count and peripheral smear provides further clues. The presence of target cells, elongated cells (potentially sickle cells), and erythrocytes with nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies) suggest a condition that distorts the shape of red blood cells. The high reticulocyte count indicates that the bone marrow is producing new red blood cells to replace those being destroyed, a characteristic response in hemolytic anemias.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is particularly common in people of African descent, which matches this patient's background. In SCD, a genetic mutation in the hemoglobin gene causes red blood cells to deform into a sickle shape under low oxygen conditions, which can obstruct blood flow and lead to recurrent painful crises, as seen in this patient. Moreover, the presence of target cells, elongated cells, and Howell-Jolly bodies is consistent with SCD. Finally, an abnormal hemoglobin electrophoresis, as suggested by the exhibit mention, can confirm the diagnosis of SCD, as this test separates and quantifies the different types of hemoglobin and is abnormal in individuals with this disease.","Sickle Cell Disease



",Y,"This patient's presentation of recurrent pain episodes, fever, jaundice, normocytic normochromic anemia, and the presence of target cells, elongated cells, and erythrocytes with nuclear remnants on a peripheral blood smear are highly indicative of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that leads to abnormal hemoglobin, which can distort red blood cells into a sickle shape. These cells can obstruct capillary blood flow causing acute pain episodes (vaso-occlusive crisis), which seem to be what the patient is experiencing. Additionally, the high reticulocyte count suggests that the body is attempting to compensate for the anemia by producing more red blood cells. The fact that the patient is African American also supports this diagnosis, as the disease is most common in people of African descent. The Hemoglobin electrophoresis, if shown to have a high HbS level, would confirm this diagnosis.","Sickle Cell Disease



",Y,"The patient's history of recurrent bone pain, anemia, and the presence of target and elongated cells (sickle cells) on peripheral blood smear strongly suggest a diagnosis of sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder common in individuals of African descent, characterized by the production of abnormal hemoglobin S (HbS). The presence of fever, jaundice, and severe bone pain is consistent with a vaso-occlusive crisis, a common acute complication of SCD, in which the sickled red blood cells block the microcirculation, leading to tissue hypoxia and infarction. This can cause a painful crisis and organ damage. His full and tense abdomen could suggest splenic sequestration, a serious complication of SCD where large amounts of blood pool in the spleen, causing a rapid drop in hemoglobin. This is common in children and can be life-threatening. His increased reticulocyte count and total bilirubin indicate increased red blood cell turnover and destruction (hemolysis). The hemoglobin electrophoresis would further support this diagnosis, showing an increased amount of HbS.","Sickle cell disease



",Y,"The prior probability of sickle cell disease in an African American child presenting with symptoms like bone pain, jaundice, and normocytic anemia is quite high. For instance, we can estimate this as a relatively high probability of 80%.

The presence of recurrent bone pain increases the likelihood of sickle cell disease, increasing the posterior probability to 90%. Recurrent bone pain is a common symptom in sickle cell disease due to vaso-occlusive crises.

Further increase in the probability is seen with the presence of abnormal blood smear findings, specifically the elongated cells which are likely sickled red blood cells. This takes our posterior probability to 95%.

The presence of target cells and reticulocytes in the peripheral smear also fits the diagnosis of sickle cell disease, further increasing the probability to 98%. Reticulocytes are young red blood cells that are often increased in conditions with high red cell turnover, like sickle cell disease, and target cells are seen in conditions of altered hemoglobin, such as sickle cell disease.

Finally, the high bilirubin level is indicative of hemolytic anemia, a key feature of sickle cell disease, pushing the final posterior probability to 99%.

In summary, based on the Bayesian approach, the most likely diagnosis for this child is sickle cell disease.",Sickle cell disease.,Y
"A 63-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized fatigue and malaise for 2 months. He has been unable to engage in his daily activities. Three months ago, he was treated for a urinary tract infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He has hypertension, asthma, and chronic lower back pain.

What is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's renal failure?""",Inhibition of prostacyclin production,Interstitial nephritis,N,Chronic pyelonephritis,N,Interstitial nephritis,N,Interstitial nephritis,N,Interstitial nephritis,N,,"This patient presents with generalized fatigue, malaise, and conjunctival pallor, all of which suggest anemia. His hemoglobin level is low, confirming this. His creatinine level is elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction, and his urea nitrogen level is also high, which often goes hand-in-hand with elevated creatinine in cases of kidney dysfunction.

His history is key in determining the most likely cause of this renal failure. He was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole three months ago. This medication can lead to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), an immune-mediated form of tubulointerstitial nephritis that can lead to acute kidney injury. However, his symptoms and lab findings have been present for two months, which suggest a chronic process.

Looking at the patient's current medications, he's taking naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Chronic NSAID use is associated with interstitial nephritis and nephrotic syndrome. Moreover, it can lead to chronic kidney disease as it decreases prostaglandin synthesis, which is necessary for maintaining renal blood flow. In addition, he's using a thiazide diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide), which can exacerbate kidney damage in the setting of NSAID use.

Lastly, an ultrasound of the kidneys shows shrunken kidneys with irregular contours and papillary calcifications, a finding consistent with analgesic nephropathy, a chronic kidney disease that can result from the long-term use (typically years) of analgesics such as NSAIDs.

Therefore, the underlying mechanism for this patient's renal failure is likely chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis secondary to chronic NSAID use, commonly referred to as analgesic nephropathy.","Analgesic nephropathy.



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrolithiasis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and renal papillary necrosis. The presentation of the patient with shrunken kidneys with irregular contours and papillary calcifications on ultrasound, a high creatinine level, and chronic symptoms suggests a chronic process. Moreover, he has a past history of hypertension which can contribute to CKD. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is less likely as the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 months, which is longer than the time frame usually associated with AKI. Nephrolithiasis typically presents with flank pain, which is absent in this case. Although the patient was recently treated for a UTI, the current urine cultures are negative, making another UTI less likely.

This patient's use of NSAIDs (naproxen, and aspirin-caffeine combination), along with his hypertension, increases his risk for renal disease, particularly analgesic nephropathy. NSAIDs can cause analgesic nephropathy which can present with papillary necrosis leading to CKD. Papillary necrosis involves coagulative necrosis of renal papillae, with sloughing and potential obstruction by sloughed papillae. Hypertension can also contribute to CKD over time.

In conclusion, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's renal failure is chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, most likely secondary to long-term NSAID use, resulting in analgesic nephropathy.","Analgesic nephropathy



",y,"This patient's generalized fatigue, malaise, and anemia, along with the abnormal kidney function tests (raised urea nitrogen and creatinine), suggest chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of protein and blood in the urine also supports a glomerular source of kidney disease. The fact that his urine cultures are negative indicates that this isn't an acute kidney issue caused by infection. The shrunken kidneys with irregular contours and papillary calcifications observed on ultrasound are consistent with chronic changes, often seen in long-standing kidney diseases.

An important clue in this case is the patient's past medical treatment: he was treated three months ago with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is known to cause interstitial nephritis and subsequent renal failure. The combination of these drugs can cause an allergic reaction leading to inflammation of the spaces between renal tubules (tubulointerstitial nephritis) which over time can lead to renal fibrosis, decreased kidney function, and ultimately chronic kidney disease. His current medications, including the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen, can also contribute to renal impairment.","Interstitial nephritis-induced renal failure



",N,"This patient's history of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole use, coupled with the laboratory results showing decreased hemoglobin, elevated urea nitrogen, and elevated creatinine point to a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, likely due to analgesic nephropathy. Naproxen, part of this patient's regimen, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), long-term use of which can lead to analgesic nephropathy, a chronic tubulointerstitial disease. NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are essential for maintaining adequate renal blood flow, particularly when renal perfusion pressure is low. Therefore, long-term NSAID use can lead to reduced renal blood flow and kidney injury. The ultrasound findings of shrunken kidneys with irregular contours and papillary calcifications are consistent with advanced analgesic nephropathy.","Analgesic Nephropathy



",Y,"This patient's clinical presentation and lab results give us a number of clues to the most likely underlying mechanism of his renal failure.

The prior probability of chronic interstitial nephritis as a cause of renal failure is around 10%. This is because it's not the most common cause of renal failure, but it is a significant one.

The fact that he has been previously treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole three months ago, a medication known to potentially cause interstitial nephritis, increases the posterior probability of this condition to around 30%.

Moreover, this patient has used an NSAID (naproxen) for his chronic back pain, which also increases the likelihood of chronic interstitial nephritis to around 40%. NSAIDs can cause kidney damage, especially when used long-term, by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which help maintain renal blood flow.

The shrunken kidneys with irregular contours and papillary calcifications on ultrasound further suggest chronic kidney disease, increasing the likelihood to 50%. These are physical signs of long-term damage, and chronic interstitial nephritis could certainly cause this kind of damage.

The presence of protein and white blood cells in the urine further indicates a kidney issue likely related to inflammation or damage to the kidney tissue, further increasing the probability to 60%. Both of these are signs of kidney damage and are common in interstitial nephritis.

So, in conclusion, considering the patient's history of medication use and the signs of chronic kidney disease both on his lab tests and his ultrasound, chronic interstitial nephritis due to the previous exposure to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and long-term NSAID use is the most probable underlying mechanism of this patient's renal failure.","Chronic interstitial nephritis.

It's important to note that the lack of scrotal swelling or discoloration does not exclude this diagnosis. The patient's sexual history is of less relevance here, as sexually transmitted infections would typically cause pain and swelling in the scrotum.","Testicular torsion



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: testicular torsion, epididymitis, inguinal hernia, testicular tumor, and kidney stone. Given that this patient has an elevated, horizontally-positioned testicle with acute onset of pain during physical activity, the most likely diagnosis is testicular torsion. Epididymitis would typically present with a red, swollen scrotum and possibly fever or discharge. Inguinal hernia would present with a bulge in the groin that might worsen with coughing or physical activity. A testicular tumor usually presents as a painless testicular lump, not sudden pain. Kidney stone could present with sudden abdominal pain but would typically also have urinary symptoms, and the testicular exam wouldn't reveal any abnormality.","Testicular torsion



",Y,"The patient presents with sudden onset of testicular pain while playing sports, which could indicate some kind of testicular injury. However, the lack of swelling or discoloration of the scrotum does not support the diagnosis of a traumatic injury. The presence of an elevated, horizontally positioned testicle suggests testicular torsion, a condition where the spermatic cord that provides the blood supply to a testicle is twisted, cutting off the blood supply and causing tissues in the testicle to die. The rapid onset of pain, high position of the testicle, and abnormal orientation (""horizontal lie"") are classic signs of testicular torsion. The patient's sexual history would be more relevant if he had symptoms consistent with a sexually transmitted infection, which he does not.","Testicular torsion



",Y,"This young man's presentation is consistent with testicular torsion. His sudden onset of severe pain during physical activity and the physical exam findings of an elevated testicle with a horizontal lie are highly suggestive of this condition. The ""horizontal lie"" refers to the abnormal orientation of the testicle, which occurs due to the twisting of the spermatic cord (the structure that provides blood supply to the testicle). Asthma and sexual history are not directly relevant to this acute situation. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and requires immediate intervention to prevent permanent damage to the testicle.","y
",Y,"The prior probability of testicular torsion is around 10% in this case given the age and sex of the patient. However, the fact that he was engaging in physical activity (football), which can sometimes precipitate testicular torsion, increases the probability to 20%. The elevated right testicle and the ""horizontal lie"" observed on physical examination increase the posterior probability of testicular torsion to about 60%. The absence of abdominal pain or scrotal swelling and discoloration may not entirely exclude testicular torsion, because these symptoms may not always be present or may develop later. The patient's sexual history is not relevant to the diagnosis in this instance as testicular torsion is not sexually transmitted. Therefore, based on the Bayesian inference, this patient most likely has testicular torsion.","Testicular Torsion

The combination of these factors suggests an inherited syndrome of colorectal cancer. One of the most common of these is Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), which is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the rectum and colon during the second decade of life. If left untreated, there is nearly a 100% chance of progression to colorectal cancer by the average age of 40 years. FAP is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, a tumor suppressor gene. The APC gene mutation leads to uncontrolled cellular proliferation, thereby causing formation of adenomatous polyps.","Mutation in APC gene.



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes sporadic colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Lynch syndrome (Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer), and inflammatory bowel disease. Sporadic colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease are less likely as they do not usually cause such a high number of adenomas. Lynch syndrome also typically presents with fewer adenomas and also includes other cancers such as endometrial and ovarian cancer. FAP, however, is a condition characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colon and rectum at a young age (typically under the age of 50). This condition is due to a mutation in the APC gene, a tumor suppressor gene, and is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Given the presentation of innumerable adenomas at a relatively young age and a family history of colorectal cancer, this patient's condition is most likely due to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.","Familial Adenomatous Polyposis



",Y,"This patient's numerous adenomas and family history of early onset colorectal cancer suggest an inherited polyposis syndrome. The most common of these is familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which results from a mutation in the APC gene (adenomatous polyposis coli). This gene is a tumor suppressor gene, and its mutation leads to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and adenoma formation. Individuals with FAP almost inevitably develop colorectal cancer without prophylactic colectomy, often at a young age.","Mutation in the APC gene



",Y,"This patient's history of innumerable adenomas in the colon combined with a family history of early-onset colorectal cancer is suggestive of a familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by the early onset of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum. The condition is caused by a germline mutation in the APC gene, a tumor suppressor gene that normally helps to regulate the growth of cells in the colon. When this gene is mutated, it can lead to unregulated cell growth and the development of adenomatous polyps. Left untreated, virtually all patients with FAP will develop colorectal cancer by middle age.","Mutation in APC gene



",Y,"The prior probability of this patient having Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is about 1 in 10,000, due to its rarity in the general population. However, given the patient's family history of colorectal cancer, the probability of this patient having FAP would increase significantly. Let's say it rises to around 1% (0.01).

Next, we consider the fact that the patient has numerous adenomas in the colon. FAP is characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colon and rectum, which is consistent with this patient's presentation. This significantly increases the probability of the patient having FAP, potentially up to around 50%.

The last piece of information to consider is the patient's age. FAP typically presents in young adults, which is consistent with this 40-year-old patient's age. This could potentially increase the probability of the patient having FAP even further, let's say up to around 80%.

In conclusion, based on the patient's family history of colorectal cancer, the presence of numerous adenomas in the colon, and the patient's age, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's illness is a germline mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, leading to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP).","Mutation in APC gene

OSA can cause recurrent episodes of hypoxia during sleep, triggering the release of stress hormones which can increase blood pressure. His hypertension, therefore, is likely secondary to his OSA.","Obstructive Sleep Apnea



",Y,"The differential for the cause of this patient's hypertension could include primary (essential) hypertension, secondary hypertension due to renal disease, adrenal disease, medication-induced hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and hypertension due to lifestyle factors such as obesity and smoking. Primary hypertension is usually a diagnosis of exclusion, when other causes have been ruled out. Given his history of snoring (reported by his wife), obesity (BMI of 37.9 kg/m^2 is in the obesity range), and symptoms of morning headaches and trouble concentrating, which can be caused by the chronic low-level hypoxia and sleep disturbance of obstructive sleep apnea, it is likely that this patient's hypertension is at least in part due to OSA. Moreover, OSA is a common cause of secondary hypertension. The chronic intermittent hypoxia experienced during episodes of apnea stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, leading to vasoconstriction and elevated blood pressure. Therefore, based on this patient's clinical picture, the most likely cause of his hypertension is obstructive sleep apnea.

",Y,"This patient's obesity (BMI 37.9 kg/m^2) and symptoms of morning headaches, concentration problems, and snoring suggest the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a condition where individuals experience periods of apnea or hypopnea during sleep due to the collapse of the upper airway. These episodes lead to intermittent hypoxia and arousal from sleep, both of which increase sympathetic nervous system activity. This sympathetic surge can result in systemic hypertension, as the body tries to compensate for the low oxygen levels by increasing the blood pressure. Given his obesity, history of snoring, and other symptoms, it is likely that this patient's hypertension is caused by obstructive sleep apnea.

",Y,"The prior probability of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) being the cause of the patient's hypertension is relatively high (about 20%) due to the connection between the two conditions in the medical literature.

The presence of a symptom such as snoring, which is often associated with OSA, further increases the likelihood to 70%. Additionally, the pattern of headaches worsening upon waking up can also be linked to nocturnal hypoxia due to OSA, pushing the likelihood to around 85%.

Physical examination shows pallor and cheilitis. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 11 g/dL. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative and stool microscopy reveals no pathogens and no leukocytes. Analysis of a 24-hour stool sample shows 12 g of fat. The patient is asked to consume 25 g of d-xylose. Five hours later, its concentration is measured in urine at 2 g (N = > 4 g/5 h). The test is repeated after a two-week course of rifaximin, but the urinary concentration of d-xylose remains the same. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hypersensitivity to gliadin,Malabsorption syndrome,N,Malabsorption,N,Malabsorption,N,Celiac Disease,Y,Malabsorption,N,,"This patient presents with symptoms of malabsorption (weight loss, greasy and foul-smelling stool) and anemia (pallor and cheilitis). Her stool analysis shows increased fat content, further suggesting malabsorption. However, there are no pathogens or leukocytes in the stool, making an infectious cause unlikely. The D-xylose absorption test is used to differentiate between malabsorption caused by mucosal disease (like celiac disease) and other causes such as bacterial overgrowth or pancreatic insufficiency. D-xylose is a simple sugar that does not require enzymes for digestion and is absorbed directly in the intestine. Therefore, a normal D-xylose test suggests intact intestinal mucosa and points towards bacterial overgrowth or pancreatic insufficiency. However, the repeated test after a course of rifaximin (an antibiotic that would treat bacterial overgrowth) shows no change in D-xylose absorption, making bacterial overgrowth unlikely. Thus, the most probable diagnosis is a form of pancreatic insufficiency, specifically exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, in which the pancreas does not produce enough digestive enzymes to properly break down food.
","Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency



",N,"This patient's symptoms include recurrent abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhea, greasy and foul-smelling stools, weight loss, pallor, and cheilitis. These symptoms point towards a malabsorption syndrome. The differential diagnoses for malabsorption include Celiac disease, Pancreatic insufficiency, Bacterial overgrowth, and Tropical sprue.

Celiac disease often presents with diarrhea, weight loss, and other signs of malabsorption, but it is less likely in this case because the patient's stool microscopy doesn't show any leukocytes, which are often present in celiac disease due to the inflammatory response.

Pancreatic insufficiency can cause greasy, foul-smelling stools due to the lack of pancreatic enzymes, but it usually presents with a history of chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, or other pancreatic diseases, none of which are mentioned in this case.

Bacterial overgrowth can cause malabsorption, but the patient's symptoms did not improve after a course of rifaximin, which is an antibiotic that treats bacterial overgrowth.

Tropical sprue is a disease characterized by chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and nutritional deficiencies. It is usually acquired in tropical regions. The diagnosis is often confirmed by a d-xylose test, which is a test that measures the absorption of a simple sugar in the intestines. A normal result (greater than 4g in 5 hours) would indicate that the small intestine is absorbing properly. Since this patient has a low d-xylose test result even after a course of rifaximin, the most likely diagnosis is Tropical sprue.","Tropical sprue.



",N,"This patient presents with abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhea, greasy and foul-smelling stools, and weight loss. Additionally, the presence of pallor and cheilitis (cracking or inflammation of the lips) suggests nutrient deficiency, possibly due to malabsorption. The analysis of a 24-hour stool sample reveals steatorrhea, or excessive fat in the feces, which is a classic sign of malabsorption. The d-xylose test was used to distinguish between malabsorption caused by the small intestine's failure to absorb nutrients (mucosal disease or small intestinal disease) versus other causes (like pancreatic insufficiency). Given the reduced urinary excretion of d-xylose, this indicates a problem with intestinal absorption (as d-xylose doesn't need to be digested, only absorbed). Rifaximin, an antibiotic, was likely given to test for bacterial overgrowth, which can also cause malabsorption. The fact that the d-xylose test didn't change after the course of antibiotics suggests that bacterial overgrowth is not the problem here. These findings suggest that the woman likely has a disorder associated with malabsorption in the small intestine. Given her age and symptoms, celiac disease is a common cause of these symptoms and findings.","Celiac disease



",Y,"The patient's symptoms of recurrent abdominal cramps, bloating, and diarrhea, coupled with the description of her stools as greasy and foul-smelling, suggest malabsorption. Malabsorption can occur due to several reasons including, but not limited to, enzyme deficiencies, diseases affecting the enterocytes (cells in the intestines that absorb nutrients), and diseases affecting the lymphatics that transport the absorbed fats. The d-xylose test is a test for carbohydrate absorption, and the fact that her test result was low even after a course of antibiotics (rifaximin) rules out bacterial overgrowth as the cause of malabsorption, since d-xylose absorption would be normal if bacterial overgrowth was the cause, as it doesn't require any enzymatic breakdown. This, combined with the fat malabsorption evident in the 24-hour stool sample (normal stool fat is less than 7g/day), suggests a disorder of the small intestinal mucosa, such as celiac disease. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder triggered by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten triggers an inflammatory response in the small intestinal mucosa leading to villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocytosis, which disrupts normal nutrient absorption.
","Celiac disease



",Y,"The prior probability of a malabsorption syndrome given the patient's symptoms of recurrent abdominal cramps, bloating, diarrhea, and greasy, foul-smelling stools is around 30%. The fact that she has also had weight loss and pallor adds to this suspicion, increasing the probability to around 50%. Given that stool microscopy reveals no pathogens and no leukocytes, we can decrease the likelihood of infectious causes of diarrhea such as bacterial or parasitic infections, which lowers the probability back to around 40%. The stool sample shows a high fat content, which increases the probability of a malabsorption syndrome to around 60%. The d-xylose absorption test result, which remains low even after antibiotic treatment, suggests that the malabsorption is due to a problem with the intestinal lining rather than overgrowth of bacteria. This suggests a disorder such as Celiac disease, which increases the probability to 80%.

This combination of respiratory and renal symptoms is suggestive of a vasculitis condition, specifically Goodpasture's syndrome. Goodpasture's syndrome is an autoimmune condition where antibodies attack the collagen in the basement membrane of the lungs and kidneys. This condition frequently presents in males in their 20s and 30s, which fits this patient's demographic.

Smoking is a known risk factor for Goodpasture's syndrome because it can expose the antigens in the basement membrane of the lungs, triggering an autoimmune response. Additionally, the presence of ""tiny red specks"" in the patient's sputum could indicate hemoptysis (coughing up blood), a common symptom in Goodpasture's syndrome due to bleeding in the alveoli of the lungs.","Goodpasture's Syndrome



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), bronchitis, tuberculosis, lung cancer, and Goodpasture syndrome. The presence of hemoptysis (coughing up blood or blood-stained mucus), shortness of breath, productive cough and diffuse bilateral rales are highly suggestive of a pulmonary process. In this context, the presence of renal impairment, indicated by increased blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, along with the presence of blood in the urine (hematuria), suggest a systemic disease that affects both lungs and kidneys. Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by lung and kidney involvement, presenting with pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis respectively. Though not common, it typically presents in young men, especially smokers, with respiratory and renal symptoms, which fits this patient's profile. Although other conditions such as CAP, tuberculosis, and lung cancer could account for some of the symptoms, none would explain the combination of respiratory and renal manifestations seen in this patient.","Goodpasture Syndrome.



",Y,"This patient presents with shortness of breath, a productive cough with yellow sputum and red specks (indicating potential blood), and diffuse bilateral rales on auscultation, all suggestive of a pulmonary process. Given the patient's age, smoking history, and mild kidney impairment (as suggested by the slightly elevated creatinine), the most likely diagnosis is Goodpasture's syndrome. This autoimmune disease involves antibodies that attack both the lungs and kidneys, leading to symptoms like hemoptysis (coughing up blood), breathlessness, and kidney dysfunction (indicated here by the presence of blood and protein in the urine). The negative HIV test rules out infections like pneumocystis pneumonia that might present similarly in the context of immunosuppression.
","Goodpasture's syndrome



",Y,"This patient is experiencing respiratory symptoms - coughing, shortness of breath, and ""red specks"" in his sputum, which may represent blood (hemoptysis). The presence of diffuse bilateral rales on lung auscultation suggests a diffuse lung disease. His kidney function test is abnormal as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The finding of microscopic hematuria without significant proteinuria on the urine dipstick suggests glomerular pathology. These findings, in addition to the absence of significant risk factors for other causes of diffuse lung disease (like immunosuppression, occupational exposure, or travel history), suggest a diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies that target the alveoli of the lungs and the glomeruli of the kidneys, leading to diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.","Goodpasture Syndrome



",Y,"The patient's symptoms and history give us some valuable information to form our prior probabilities. Given his age and smoking habit, a respiratory condition such as pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) could have a relatively high prior probability. However, these conditions would typically be accompanied by fever and other systemic signs of infection, which are absent in this case.

The presence of blood in his sputum and urine (hemoptysis and hematuria) is a significant clue that this patient might have Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the lungs and kidneys. In the general population, the prior probability of this disease would be quite low due to its rarity.

But in the context of the patient's specific symptoms, the posterior probability begins to increase. For example, the presence of respiratory symptoms along with hemoptysis may increase the probability to around 10%. Furthermore, the finding of blood in the urine, suggesting renal involvement, increases the posterior probability to perhaps 30%. The absence of leukocytes or nitrates in the urine decreases the likelihood of a urinary tract infection as the cause of the hematuria, thus raising the probability of Goodpasture syndrome further.

His elevated creatinine level suggests renal impairment, consistent with Goodpasture syndrome, possibly increasing the probability to 50%. Considering all these factors, the most likely diagnosis, based on Bayesian inference, is Goodpasture syndrome.","Goodpasture Syndrome

His symptoms of abdominal distension, pain, nausea, and vomiting suggest a possible liver infection. The mild eosinophilia is also suggestive of a parasitic infection. The findings on the CT scan of the abdomen, particularly the eggshell calcifications in the liver, are classic for Echinococcus granulosus infection, a tapeworm that can cause a condition known as hydatid disease. This parasite's eggs can be ingested from contaminated food or water and then hatch in the host's intestine, enter the bloodstream, and travel to organs like the liver, where they form cysts that can cause symptoms like this patient's.","Echinococcus granulosus infection



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: hepatic cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver abscess, cholecystitis, and liver parasites like Echinococcus and Fasciola.

The chronic nature of his symptoms and his profession of being a farmer that interacts with livestock and breeds dogs raises the suspicion of a zoonotic disease, possibly parasitic. Both Echinococcus granulosus (hydatid disease) and Fasciola hepatica could be possibilities given his profession, but the presence of eggshell calcifications on CT scan is more suggestive of hydatid disease caused by Echinococcus granulosus. Echinococcosis can cause a chronic condition characterized by cyst formation, often in the liver, leading to abdominal distension and discomfort.

",Y,"This patient's presentation of abdominal distension with pain, nausea, and vomiting, combined with his occupational exposure to livestock and dogs, suggests the possibility of a zoonotic disease. The CT scan findings of ""eggshell"" calcifications in the liver are characteristic of hydatid disease, also known as Echinococcosis. This condition is caused by the ingestion of eggs from the Echinococcus tapeworm, often through contact with feces from infected dogs or by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite. Humans act as intermediate hosts in the life cycle of the parasite, where it forms cysts in organs such as the liver, causing symptoms like abdominal pain and distension. Therefore, this patient's symptoms are likely due to Echinococcus infection, leading to hydatid disease.","Echinococcus infection



",Y,"The patient's presentation with abdominal distension, pain, nausea, vomiting, and the finding of multiple small eggshell calcifications in the liver, coupled with a history of working with livestock and breeding dogs, point to a parasitic infection. Specifically, Echinococcus granulosus, a tapeworm found in dogs and livestock, is known to cause hydatid disease, where cysts form in the liver (and occasionally in other organs). Over time, the cysts calcify, which is likely the cause of the ""eggshell calcifications"" seen on the CT scan. Eosinophilia is also commonly seen in parasitic infections, which aligns with this patient's lab findings.

",Y,"The prior probability of this patient having Echinococcus infection is quite low, let's say it's 1% due to general rarity. However, the patient has risk factors such as interaction with livestock and dogs, which increases the posterior probability of Echinococcus infection to about 20%. Abdominal distension and undulating pain further increases the probability to about 35%. The presence of eosinophilia, a sign of a parasitic infection, increases the probability to about 50%. Finally, the CT findings of multiple small eggshell calcifications within the liver are quite characteristic for Echinococcal (Hydatid) cysts, and this increases the probability to around 80%.

This is known as Dressler's syndrome, a type of post-myocardial infarction syndrome. Additionally, the physical examination finding of distant heart sounds and a scratching sound along the left sternal border is suggestive of pericardial friction rub, commonly seen in pericarditis.

Following an MI, like the anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction this patient had a few weeks ago, fibrin and other inflammatory substances can accumulate in the pericardial space. This causes irritation and inflammation of the pericardium. Common symptoms include chest pain that worsens when lying flat and improves upon sitting up and leaning forward, as well as dyspnea. Examination can reveal a pericardial friction rub, which could be the ""scratching"" sound heard at the left sternal border. ECG changes in pericarditis include widespread ST segment elevation and PR depression. Given this patient's history and symptoms, pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis.","Pericarditis



",Y,"The prior probability of pericarditis in this scenario can be considered around 2% considering the general population.

"A previously healthy 13-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of a change in behavior. The mother reports that over the past 6 months, her daughter has had frequent mood swings. Sometimes, she is irritable for several days and loses her temper easily. In between these episodes, she behaves “normal,” spends time with her friends, and participates in gymnastics training twice a week. The mother has also noticed that her daughter needs more time than usual to get ready for school. Sometimes, she puts on excessive make-up. One month ago, her teacher had informed the parents that their daughter had skipped school and was seen at the local mall with one of her classmates instead. The patient reports that she often feels tired, especially when she has to wake up early for school. On the weekends, she sleeps until 1 pm. Menses have occurred at 15- to 45-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years; they are not associated with abdominal discomfort or functional impairment.

These symptoms, particularly if they have been recurrent and persistent over the last six months, suggest the possible onset of a mood disorder. In this age group, one of the most common mood disorders is adolescent bipolar disorder, which can present with periods of mania (marked by irritability and increased energy or activity levels) alternating with periods of normal behavior. It's also important to rule out typical adolescent behavior or other conditions; however, the described frequency, intensity, and impact of her symptoms on daily functioning (school attendance, social activities) lean towards a more significant clinical issue.

She has mood swings, irritability, and changes in sleep patterns, which can be features of bipolar disorder or normal adolescence. However, her behavior is not accompanied by periods of depressed mood, ruling out bipolar disorder. The need for more sleep, especially on weekends, is quite typical for adolescents. Excessive makeup application and skipping school are also typical rebellious behavior for adolescents, which may not indicate a disorder but rather a phase of testing boundaries. The absence of any physical abnormalities also suggests that her changes in behavior might be due to normal developmental changes and not an underlying psychiatric disorder.

",Y,"The patient, a 13-year-old girl, has presented with recent changes in her behavior including frequent mood swings, periods of irritability, needing more time to get ready (possibly a sign of perfectionism or obsessive behavior), skipping school, and excessive sleepiness. These signs may suggest an underlying psychiatric condition. Considering the age of onset, her mood swings, and changes in behavior and sleep pattern, it is suggestive of a mood disorder. Bipolar disorder can present in adolescence and may include periods of depression (indicated here by sleeping in, fatigue, and possible social withdrawal) interspersed with periods of elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. The use of excessive makeup and the act of skipping school may reflect impulsive or risk-taking behavior, which can be seen in the manic or hypomanic phase of bipolar disorder.

",N,"This young girl is presenting with symptoms that are characteristic of a mood disorder. Specifically, her mood swings, irritability, excessive make-up use, and avoidance of school responsibilities suggest periods of elevated mood, which can occur in bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder in children often presents differently than it does in adults, with rapid mood swings between depression and mania over the course of a day, and disruptive behaviors. These signs are often misdiagnosed as normal adolescence, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder. In the case of this patient, she also presents with periods of 'normal' mood and increased need for sleep, which can be part of the depressive phase or the return to a baseline state. There are no signs of physical illness, making a psychiatric disorder more likely.
","Bipolar disorder



",N,"The prior probability of a mood disorder, such as bipolar disorder, in a teenage girl is around 1-3%. The presentation of mood swings, irritability, change in behavior, and a need for excessive sleep can increase the posterior probability to 15-20%. The presence of abnormal behaviors such as skipping school and excessive makeup application, not typical of her usual behavior, might further increase the probability to around 30%. However, the absence of major depressive or manic episodes that severely impair function makes bipolar disorder less likely.

The probability of normal adolescent behavior might start at around 40-50%, given this is the most common 'condition' in this age group. The described behaviors, such as mood swings, irritability, sleeping in on weekends, are quite common in normal adolescents, increasing the probability to around 60%. The absence of severe mood disturbances, functional impairment or risky behaviors further supports this diagnosis, raising the posterior probability to around 75%.

The girl's irregular menses since menarche is a common finding in teenage girls as they establish their menstrual cycle, so it does not significantly alter the probabilities.

Based on this Bayesian inference analysis, the most likely explanation for the patient's behavior is normal adolescence.","Normal adolescent behavior.

The symptoms began a couple of hours after the surgery. Moreover, the physical examination shows that the left lower extremity is swollen, stiff, and tender to palpation. These signs and symptoms strongly suggest an acute compartment syndrome, which is caused by an increase in the pressure within a muscle compartment leading to decreased blood flow to the affected area. In this case, the surgery, possible hematoma, or edema from the reperfusion of the embolectomized limb could have triggered the compartment syndrome. The classic sign is pain out of proportion to the physical findings and intense pain during passive stretch of the muscles in the compartment (pain during dorsiflexion of her foot).
","Acute Compartment Syndrome



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes acute arterial occlusion, venous thrombosis, compartment syndrome, and neuropathy. The history of recent embolectomy, coupled with her symptoms of severe pain, numbness, and tingling suggests an ischemic cause. However, the palpable femoral pulses and weaker but present pedal pulses, along with the absence of other signs of ischemia (like pallor, poikilothermia), make acute arterial occlusion unlikely.

Venous thrombosis could also cause swelling and pain, but it's usually associated with a more indolent course and doesn't explain the severity of pain and the presence of paresthesia.

Neuropathy can cause numbness and tingling, but it's usually a chronic condition and not typically associated with acute severe pain and swelling.

Compartment syndrome is characterized by severe pain, paresthesias, and swelling, which is consistent with this patient's presentation. Dorsiflexion of the foot causing severe pain in the calf (a positive Homan's sign) is also suggestive of deep vein thrombosis, but it can also occur in compartment syndrome due to increased pressure in the compartment during muscle stretching. Additionally, the clinical picture of compartment syndrome can appear following revascularization procedures like an embolectomy, as blood flow is suddenly restored to a previously ischemic area, causing swelling within the non-compliant fascial compartments.

Therefore, the most likely cause of these findings is compartment syndrome.","Compartment Syndrome.

After the embolectomy, she has presented with severe pain, numbness, and tingling of the left leg, signs consistent with ischemic nerve injury. The leg is described as swollen, stiff, and tender on palpation, typical of increased compartment pressure. Furthermore, her pain is significantly increased on dorsiflexion of her foot, a positive sign of passive stretch (pain on passive stretch of the muscles within the compartment), which is a classic sign of compartment syndrome. The presence of these symptoms following a surgical procedure that could potentially cause bleeding or edema (both of which can increase compartment pressure) in the setting of her other risk factors such as obesity and peripheral artery disease support the diagnosis.","Compartment syndrome



",Y,"This patient's signs and symptoms suggest compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome is a condition that involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment which can lead to muscle and nerve damage. In this case, the patient has recently undergone a femoral artery embolectomy which could have led to bleeding and increased pressure in the compartment. This is supported by the findings of severe pain, swelling, stiffness, and tenderness in the affected area. Pain with passive dorsiflexion of the foot is a classic sign of compartment syndrome in the lower extremities. Although her peripheral pulses are weakly palpable, the presence of pulses does not rule out compartment syndrome as the pressure may not be high enough to stop arterial flow but may be enough to cause venous obstruction and subsequent compartment syndrome. The decision to treat is clinical, based on the symptoms and examination, rather than on any particular measurement of compartment pressure.
","Compartment syndrome



",Y,"This patient is presenting with severe pain, numbness, tingling, and swelling in the left leg following a left femoral artery embolectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove a blockage in the femoral artery. These symptoms suggest some form of vascular compromise. The prior probability for compartment syndrome in this context might be around 5%.

An important symptom that raises the posterior probability significantly is the pain during dorsiflexion of the foot, known as a positive Homan's sign. This is a classic sign of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it can also occur in compartment syndrome due to muscle ischemia, raising the probability of compartment syndrome to around 30%.

The fact that this patient is experiencing these symptoms shortly after an arterial embolectomy also raises the probability of compartment syndrome. It could be that the procedure, while successful in removing the blockage, might have led to reperfusion injury and increased pressure in the compartment of the leg, which in turn could have led to the development of compartment syndrome. This further raises the posterior probability to 60%.

Finally, her pedal pulses being weaker on the left side as compared to the right side suggests impaired circulation, which supports the diagnosis of compartment syndrome. This evidence increases the probability to approximately 80%.

Given these findings and the patient's clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is compartment syndrome.","Compartment syndrome

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) shows a bilateral narrowing of renal arteries. What is most likely this patient’s new medication that caused his acute renal failure?",Captopril,Blood pressure medication,N,Blood pressure medication,N,Blood pressure medication,N,Blood pressure medication,N,ACE inhibitor,Y,,"The patient was recently diagnosed with hypertension, and since starting a new medication, his creatinine level has increased, indicating a deterioration in kidney function, which points towards acute renal failure. This clinical scenario is typical of renal artery stenosis exacerbated by certain antihypertensive medications.

Renal artery stenosis can be caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia, leading to a reduction in blood flow to the kidneys. The kidneys, sensing this reduction in blood flow, respond by releasing renin, which increases the production of angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, and thereby increasing the blood pressure.

Certain antihypertensive medications can exacerbate renal artery stenosis. These include ACE inhibitors (such as lisinopril) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs such as losartan), which inhibit the angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to dilation of the efferent renal arteriole. In patients with renal artery stenosis, these medications can cause a drastic fall in glomerular filtration pressure, leading to acute renal failure.

Since this patient's blood pressure has not decreased with the initiation of the new medication and his creatinine has increased significantly, it is likely that he is on an ACE inhibitor or an ARB.","ACE inhibitor or ARB.



",Y,"The patient's clinical picture, characterized by recently diagnosed hypertension and the new finding of an increased creatinine level (1.8 mg/dL from 0.80 mg/dL two weeks ago), suggests a renal condition. The Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) shows bilateral narrowing of the renal arteries, indicating the possibility of renal artery stenosis.

The new medication for his hypertension is likely causing a decrease in renal perfusion pressure due to dilation of the efferent arteriole in the nephron. Among antihypertensive drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have this effect. These medications work by blocking the effects of angiotensin, leading to dilation of the efferent arterioles, reducing glomerular filtration pressure and, if the patient has renal artery stenosis, may cause acute renal failure due to a significant drop in renal perfusion.

Given this patient's history of newly diagnosed hypertension and his laboratory findings of worsening renal function, it is likely that an ACE inhibitor or ARB is responsible for the acute renal failure.","ACE Inhibitor or ARB



",Y,"This patient's hypertension, elevated blood pressure even after starting medication, and the laboratory finding of an increase in creatinine and BUN levels, suggest renal function impairment. The MRA showing bilateral narrowing of renal arteries indicates renal artery stenosis. When angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are started in a patient with bilateral renal artery stenosis, they can precipitate an acute kidney injury. These medications dilate the efferent arterioles of the glomerulus, leading to decreased glomerular filtration pressure. In the setting of renal artery stenosis, there is already reduced perfusion pressure; therefore, further decrease in glomerular filtration pressure can lead to acute kidney injury. Given his hypertension and the recent changes in his laboratory values, it's likely that his new medication is an ACE inhibitor or an ARB.
","ACE inhibitor or ARB



",Y,"This patient presents with an increase in blood pressure and a significant increase in creatinine from baseline, suggesting a recent development of acute kidney injury. The given clinical scenario (hypertension and bilateral narrowing of renal arteries - indicating renovascular disease) is characteristic of renal artery stenosis, a condition in which the arteries that carry blood to the kidneys become narrowed. One common treatment for hypertension is the use of ACE inhibitors (such as lisinopril) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). These drugs work by decreasing systemic vascular resistance and decreasing intraglomerular pressure, which can be protective in many types of kidney disease. However, in patients with renal artery stenosis, these drugs can exacerbate renal insufficiency by further decreasing the already compromised perfusion pressure. Thus, in the presence of renal artery stenosis, the abrupt introduction of ACE inhibitors or ARBs can lead to a sharp decrease in renal function - as evidenced by the rapid increase in creatinine in this patient.
","ACE inhibitor or ARB



",Y,"The prior probability of using ACE inhibitors or ARBs in hypertensive patients is relatively high, considering their first-line status in hypertension management. However, we don't have specific numbers. Let's denote this as P(D), the prior probability of the drug being an ACE inhibitor or ARB.

The development of acute kidney injury in the context of starting new antihypertensive medication should make one suspect a medication that affects the renal vasculature, particularly the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). ACE inhibitors and ARBs both decrease glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by dilating the efferent arteriole of the glomerulus, and can cause acute kidney injury in cases of bilateral renal artery stenosis. This is due to the fact that patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis rely on efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction (mediated by angiotensin II) to maintain adequate GFR. Therefore, let's denote P(H|D) as the probability of developing acute kidney injury given the patient was taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB. This probability is relatively high.

Finally, given the MRA findings of bilateral renal artery stenosis (P(E)), we can further narrow down our potential culprits. In a Bayesian context, this can be viewed as an update to our likelihood: P(E|H), the probability of having bilateral renal artery stenosis given the patient developed acute kidney injury.

Applying Bayes' theorem, our posterior probability P(D|H,E) can be calculated as [P(H|D) * P(D|E)] / P(H), where P(H) is the marginal probability of developing acute kidney injury. Without specific numbers, it's difficult to compute this exactly, but given our knowledge of the physiology involved, P(D|H,E) (the probability of the drug being an ACE inhibitor or ARB given the patient developed acute kidney injury and had bilateral renal artery stenosis) is quite high.","ACE inhibitor or ARB

Her bradycardia, pinpoint pupils, and slowed respiratory rate suggest opioid overdose, as these are classic signs of this condition. Alcohol intoxication generally leads to mydriasis (dilated pupils), not pinpoint pupils, and typically doesn't cause severe bradycardia. Hypoglycemia can lead to decreased consciousness, but it doesn't typically cause pinpoint pupils or bradycardia. While head trauma could cause unconsciousness, there's no mention of any signs of trauma. Therefore, opioid overdose is the most likely cause of her symptoms.
","Opioid overdose



",Y,"The patient presents with bradycardia, decreased responsiveness to verbal commands but responsiveness to pain, and pinpoint pupils. These symptoms are classic signs of opioid overdose. The history of being found unconscious at a party where alcohol was present also points towards possible substance abuse. The fact that the patient responds to painful stimuli, but not to verbal commands, indicates a significant central nervous system depression, which is consistent with opioid overdose.","Opioid overdose



",Y,"This patient presents with bradycardia, reduced responsiveness, and pinpoint pupils. These are classic signs of opioid toxicity, likely caused by an opioid overdose. At a party with alcohol present, it's plausible that other substances such as opioids could have also been available. Opioids act on the central nervous system, slowing down both heart rate and respiratory rate, and also causing miosis or pinpoint pupils. The patient's responsiveness only to noxious stimuli suggests significant CNS depression.
","Opioid Overdose



",Y,"The prior probability of opioid overdose in a patient who has a decreased level of consciousness is about 20%. The presentation of bradycardia increases the posterior probability of opioid overdose to 40%. Pinpoint pupils, a classic symptom of opioid overdose, further increases the probability to 70%. Additionally, the slow respiratory rate, another common symptom, increases the probability to 90%. Given that she was found unconscious at a party where alcohol was present, the possibility of substance misuse is increased. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is an opioid overdose.

Given the newborn's age (4-days-old), the distribution of the rash, and the mother's history of gonorrhea (an STD), the most likely diagnosis is neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV can be transmitted from the mother to the baby during vaginal delivery, and this is particularly concerning when the mother has not had prenatal care, as there may not have been screening or treatment for the condition during pregnancy. Neonatal HSV infection often presents within the first week of life with a vesicular rash, which can progress to pustules or ulcers. Therefore, this newborn's presentation is most suggestive of neonatal HSV infection.

",N,"The differential diagnosis for a newborn with a generalized rash could include neonatal acne, seborrheic dermatitis, erythema toxicum neonatorum, neonatal herpes simplex virus infection, neonatal varicella, or neonatal congenital syphilis. Neonatal acne and seborrheic dermatitis usually present with rashes on the face and scalp, and not the trunk and extremities. Erythema toxicum neonatorum can present with erythematous macules, papules, and pustules, but it usually resolves within the first week of life and would not be present in a 4-day-old newborn.

Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection can present with a vesicular rash, not a maculopapular rash. Neonatal varicella would be unusual as the mother does not report a history of chickenpox or shingles during pregnancy.

Given the maternal history of gonorrhea and lack of prenatal care (which suggests she may have also had untreated syphilis), the rash, and its distribution (a rash on the trunk and extremities but sparing the palms and soles), the most likely diagnosis is neonatal congenital syphilis.","Neonatal Congenital Syphilis.



",N,"This newborn has a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash and pustules, sparing the palms and soles. This is commonly associated with neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (HSV). Given the mother's history of sexually transmitted disease, the risk of transmission of HSV to the newborn is high, especially considering that the mother did not receive prenatal care where an HSV infection may have been identified and treated. Neonatal HSV infections usually present within the first week after birth, as seen in this case, and often manifest with a disseminated rash.

",N,"The rash presentation in this neonate, who is 4 days old, is indicative of a condition known as Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum (ETN). This condition is characterized by an erythematous maculopapular rash and pustules with an erythematous base. It commonly appears during the first week of life, which aligns with the age of this infant. The mother's history of gonorrhea, although relevant for maternal and prenatal health, is not directly related to this presentation, as the rash associated with neonatal gonococcal infection typically involves the palms and soles, which is not the case in this infant. Other neonatal infections (such as herpes, syphilis) also typically present differently. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case would be Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum (ETN).
","Erythema Toxicum Neonatorum



",Y,"The prior probability for neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in this case might be low, let's say around 1%, given that it's not a particularly common condition. However, we are informed the mother has a history of sexually transmitted infections (gonorrhea), which may increase the risk of HSV, so we adjust our probability to, say, 10%.

The rash that presents as erythematous maculopapular and pustular, while sparing the palms and soles, is suggestive of neonatal HSV, bringing the probability up to around 30%. The fact that the newborn is only 4 days old and the mother had no prenatal care (which could have detected and managed maternal HSV) increases the probability to around 50%.

Considering all this evidence, it's reasonable to suspect neonatal HSV infection as the most likely diagnosis in this case.","Neonatal Herpes Simplex Virus

MG is a neuromuscular disorder that is caused by the immune system targeting and destroying the receptors used for nerve-muscle communication, leading to fluctuating muscle weakness that often worsens with exercise and improves with rest. The fact that the weakness is more severe in the upper extremities and that she has diplopia (ocular muscles are frequently affected in MG) also supports this diagnosis.

",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr� syndrome, multiple sclerosis, polymyositis, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

This patient has been experiencing weakness and fatigue, particularly at the end of the day and during periods of exertion, which points towards a neuromuscular junction disorder. Myasthenia gravis is a condition that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles, the muscles that the body uses for movement. It's caused by a breakdown in the normal communication between nerves and muscles.

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of diplopia (double vision) and variable muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest are highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis. Guillain-Barr� syndrome typically presents as an ascending paralysis, starting in the lower extremities, which is not observed in this patient. Multiple sclerosis could present with these symptoms, but it usually has other neurological signs and symptoms. Polymyositis typically involves proximal muscle weakness, not selective for upper or lower extremities, and doesn't explain the diplopia. Chronic fatigue syndrome usually does not present with such objective motor weakness.

Based on these considerations, this patient most likely has myasthenia gravis.","Myasthenia Gravis



",Y,"This patient's presentation of generalized weakness that worsens throughout the day, combined with mild diplopia (double vision), is highly suggestive of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease characterized by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which impairs the transmission of signals from nerves to muscles. This results in fluctuating muscle weakness that typically worsens with activity and improves with rest. The weakness often affects the muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, talking, and swallowing, but it can also affect other muscle groups. Although this condition can occur at any age, it is more common in women under 40.

",Y,"This patient's presentation of progressive weakness that worsens with exertion, mild diplopia (double vision), and frequent illness recently during a time of travel and potential exposure to various infections or toxins is highly suggestive of a disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The prime example of such a disorder is Myasthenia Gravis. This autoimmune disease is characterized by the production of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor in the neuromuscular junction, leading to a decrease in available receptors and an inability to effectively transmit the signal from nerve to muscle. This results in muscle weakness which typically worsens with sustained activity and improves with rest.
","Myasthenia Gravis



",Y,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of a neurological issue. Specifically, the symptoms of fatigue and weakness that worsen throughout the day, along with diplopia, are suggestive of myasthenia gravis.

The patient exhibits weakness that worsens throughout the day. This symptom, known as fatigability, is highly characteristic of myasthenia gravis, and could increase our posterior probability to about 30%.

The fact that the patient also has diplopia (double vision), another common symptom of Myasthenia Gravis, increases the probability further. It's hard to provide an exact percentage increase, but let's say this raises the posterior probability to 60%.

The finding of reduced strength in the upper extremities compared to the lower extremities is also consistent with the typical presentation of Myasthenia Gravis, which could further increase our posterior probability. Let's say this brings it up to 75%.

Pancreatitis due to hypertriglyceridemia typically occurs in the setting of poorly controlled diabetes, which could also fit this patient's medical history. The elevated lipase, which is more specific to pancreatic injury than amylase, supports this diagnosis.

Acute pancreatitis often presents as mid-epigastric pain that radiates to the back. The most common causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and alcohol, but neither seems to be the case here. Hypertriglyceridemia can also cause acute pancreatitis when triglyceride levels are very high, usually above 1000 mg/dL, which is the case here.

High triglyceride levels (in this case, 942 mg/dL, normal is usually less than 150 mg/dL) can cause pancreatitis.

",Y,"The patient has severe mid-epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, which is a typical presentation of pancreatitis. The elevated lipase level (which is more specific than amylase for pancreatitis) confirms this. Although the patient has diabetes and hypertension, which could predispose to conditions such as myocardial infarction (chest pain radiating to the back), the clinical picture does not suggest this. Hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known risk factor for pancreatitis when levels exceed 500 mg/dL, and in this case, the level is significantly elevated at 942 mg/dL. In this context, the pancreatitis is likely due to the hypertriglyceridemia.
","Hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis.



",Y,"We start by establishing a prior probability based on the clinical picture. The patient is presenting with severe mid-epigastric pain radiating to the back, which is suggestive of a pancreatic condition, therefore the prior probability of acute pancreatitis is set at 50%.

The pain's location and radiation further supports pancreatitis, increasing the posterior probability to 60%. The patient's history of hypertriglyceridemia significantly contributes to the likelihood of acute pancreatitis, which pushes the probability up to 75%, as hypertriglyceridemia is a known risk factor for acute pancreatitis, and the patient's triglycerides level is remarkably high at 942 mg/dL.

An elevated lipase (250 U/L in this case) is a definitive indicator of pancreatitis, raising the probability to 90%. The absence of significant liver enzyme elevations (AST, ALT) and the presence of normal amylase levels may initially appear contradictory, but acute pancreatitis can indeed occur with normal amylase levels, especially in hypertriglyceridemia-induced cases where the lipase is more specific.

Given these considerations, the Bayesian inference indicates a very high likelihood of acute pancreatitis.","Acute pancreatitis

This disease is an autosomal recessive disorder causing defective chloride channels, leading to thick, sticky mucus in multiple organs. In the pancreas, this mucus obstructs the pancreatic ducts, preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines to help break down and absorb dietary fats. Consequently, patients suffer from malnutrition and steatorrhea.

Further, the child has had frequent flu-like symptoms and multiple hospitalizations for pneumonia, which are common in children with CF due to their increased susceptibility to respiratory infections; this information increases the posterior probability to around 60%. In addition, the child's physical examination findings of underweight, pallor, and dehydration, as well as lung auscultation revealing rhonchi (an indication of possible lung disease), are all consistent with CF and further increase the posterior probability to 85%.

This elevates the probability of septic emboli to 30%.

Secondly, on day 3 of his hospital stay, the patient develops neurological symptoms, specifically right-sided weakness in his arm and leg and dysarthric speech. These are common symptoms of stroke, which further increases the posterior probability of septic emboli, as emboli from an infectious endocarditis can travel to the brain and cause stroke. This brings the probability of septic emboli causing stroke to 70%.

Finally, considering that the patient was already treated appropriately in the ICU, it is less likely that his symptoms are due to a new onset disease.

The cardiac involvement (Lyme carditis) typically appears as atrioventricular (AV) block due to inflammation in the heart tissue, which seems to be the case in this patient, who is showing a Mobitz I second-degree AV block on his EKG. Therefore, the most likely cause of his cardiac symptoms is Lyme carditis.
","Lyme carditis



",Y,"This patient's symptoms of dizziness, palpitations, fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias along with the distinctive erythematous ""bull's eye"" rash are highly indicative of Lyme disease, an infectious disease caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. The fact that the patient was in the woods of Massachusetts (an area where Lyme disease is prevalent) strengthens the likelihood of this diagnosis. Lyme disease often presents with a wide range of systemic symptoms due to the bacteria's ability to affect multiple body systems. In the heart, Lyme disease can cause Lyme carditis, which results from direct bacterial invasion and inflammation of the heart tissue. This can disrupt the normal electrical conduction system of the heart and lead to various types of heart block, including the Mobitz I second-degree AV block that is seen on the patient's ECG. This heart block can explain the patient's symptoms of dizziness and palpitations.
","Lyme Carditis



",Y,"The prior probability of Lyme disease in this case, considering the context, is estimated to be 10%. The patient was in the woods of Massachusetts, a known endemic area for Lyme disease, which increases the probability to around 30%. The presence of the erythematous lesion with a bull's-eye pattern, a characteristic sign of Lyme disease, increases the probability further to about 80%. The patient's clinical symptoms such as dizziness, palpitations, fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias are also consistent with Lyme disease, further increasing the likelihood to 90%. Lastly, the presentation of a Mobitz I second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, a known cardiac manifestation of Lyme disease, takes the posterior probability to almost certainty, about 99%. Thus, the patient's cardiac symptoms are most likely due to Lyme disease.

He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and recent hospitalization for congestive heart failure exacerbation. On physical examination, the left calf is 4 cm greater in circumference than the right. Pitting edema is present on the left leg and there are superficial dilated veins.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Deep venous thrombosis,Deep vein thrombosis (DVT),Y,Deep vein thrombosis,Y,Deep vein thrombosis.,Y,Deep vein thrombosis,Y,Deep vein thrombosis,Y,,"The patient is presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain. Given her recent history of hospitalization for congestive heart failure exacerbation, she has been relatively immobile, increasing her risk for venous stasis. The physical examination findings further support the suspicion of a venous problem, particularly with the evidence of pitting edema and superficial dilated veins. A key piece of information comes from the venous duplex ultrasound, which shows inability to fully compress the lumen of the profunda femoris vein. This is suggestive of a thrombus blocking the vein. Therefore, this patient most likely has a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body, typically in the lower leg or thigh.
","Deep Vein Thrombosis



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), cellulitis, a Baker's cyst, and congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation. The unilateral nature of the swelling, increased circumference of one calf compared to the other, pitting edema, superficial dilated veins, and the inability to fully compress the vein on ultrasound are all strong indicators of DVT. Cellulitis often presents with local signs of infection such as redness, warmth, and tenderness, which are not mentioned in this case. A Baker's cyst would not typically result in the inability to compress a vein on ultrasound. Although the patient does have a history of CHF, the unilateral nature of the presentation is atypical. The ultrasound findings specifically point towards DVT. Therefore, the patient most likely has a deep vein thrombosis.

The inability to fully compress the lumen of the profunda femoris vein during a venous duplex ultrasound confirms this diagnosis.
","Deep venous thrombosis



",Y,"This patient has a recent history of hospitalization and is presenting with unilateral leg swelling and pain, which are classic symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Risk factors for DVT in this patient include her recent hospitalization and history of congestive heart failure. DVT typically results in edema, pain, and sometimes superficial venous dilation due to increased pressure in the venous system. The venous duplex ultrasound, which shows an inability to compress the vein fully, is diagnostic for DVT, as normal veins are fully compressible. DVT is a common complication in patients who are hospitalized and immobile for extended periods.

She has pulmonary symptoms, skin findings, neurologic symptoms, and renal abnormalities. Chronic sinusitis, asthma, and eosinophilia are consistent with an allergic or autoimmune process. The skin findings (tender subcutaneous nodules on extensor surfaces and palpable, erythematous lesions on shins) are typical for vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels. The impaired foot dorsiflexion and decreased sensation suggest peripheral nerve involvement (peripheral neuropathy), which can also occur in vasculitis affecting the vasa nervorum (the small blood vessels supplying nerves). Renal involvement is suggested by elevated serum urea and creatinine and presence of protein and blood in the urine, which are indicative of glomerulonephritis. The most likely diagnosis that integrates all these features is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA, formerly known as Churg-Strauss Syndrome), a form of small-vessel vasculitis associated with asthma, eosinophilia, and involvement of multiple organ systems.
","Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis), multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr� syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy.

This patient's history of asthma and sinusitis, elevated eosinophil count, kidney dysfunction (elevated BUN and creatinine), presence of blood and protein in the urine, as well as neurological deficits, are indicative of systemic disease, likely vasculitis. The presence of eosinophilia and asthma narrows the differential to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome.

EGPA is a small-vessel vasculitis characterized by eosinophilia, asthma, and mononeuritis multiplex, which is typically characterized by an asymmetric pattern of motor or sensory deficits. The skin findings of tender subcutaneous nodules and palpable purpura are also consistent with this diagnosis, as these are signs of cutaneous vasculitis.

So based on the findings and the systematic deduction of symptoms, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.","Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis.



",Y,"This patient's presentation of peripheral neuropathy (impaired foot dorsiflexion and decreased forearm sensation), skin nodules and palpable purpura, asthma, chronic sinusitis, elevated eosinophil count, renal dysfunction, and hematuria/proteinuria are all characteristic of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. This is a small-vessel vasculitis associated with asthma and eosinophilia. Neurologic involvement (peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex) occurs due to the vasculitic process, and skin involvement (purpura, nodules) also represents vascular inflammation. Renal involvement is less common but can present with an RPGN pattern, as suggested by this patient's hematuria, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency.
",Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.,Y,"The patient presents with a combination of neurological symptoms, pulmonary signs, and renal abnormalities, along with a significant count of eosinophils in her blood, indicating systemic inflammation. The subcutaneous nodules on the extensor surfaces of her elbows and non-blanching erythematous lesions on her shins suggest cutaneous involvement, while the impaired dorsiflexion of her right foot and decreased sensation over the ulnar aspect of the left forearm suggest peripheral nerve involvement. Her lung examination revealed diffuse wheezing, indicating pulmonary involvement. Also, the elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in the blood, as well as the presence of blood and protein in her urine, suggest renal involvement. The combination of these features�asthma, peripheral neuropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, eosinophilia, and kidney damage�is suggestive of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation in small- to medium-sized blood vessels and is characterized by asthma, lung infiltrates, and high levels of eosinophils.
",Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA),Y,"Let's begin the Bayesian inference step by step:

The prior probability for Churg-Strauss syndrome (also known as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis) is relatively low in the general population given its rarity. We'll estimate it at 1%.

The patient has multiple symptoms consistent with Churg-Strauss Syndrome including: eosinophilia (high eosinophil count in blood - 29%), impaired foot dorsiflexion and decreased sensation in the left forearm suggesting peripheral neuropathy, and subcutaneous nodules and non-blanching erythematous lesions suggesting skin involvement. Each of these is a key feature of the syndrome. Given these, we can adjust the posterior probability to 30%.

Furthermore, she has a history of asthma and sinusitis, common in Churg-Strauss Syndrome patients, and also presenting with recent-onset difficulty walking and general fatigue. This aligns with the multi-systemic nature of Churg-Strauss Syndrome, increasing the probability to 50%.

Laboratory tests show elevated creatinine and presence of blood and protein in the urine, suggesting renal involvement. This fits with the known vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) aspect of Churg-Strauss Syndrome, which can affect the kidneys. With these added factors, the posterior probability rises to 80%.

Given the combination of her symptoms, history, and test results, it seems most probable that this patient has Churg-Strauss Syndrome.","Churg-Strauss Syndrome

Her laboratory findings, however, further guide our diagnosis. She has hypokalemia (low potassium), which is common in people with bulimia nervosa due to excessive vomiting leading to loss of gastric content, and metabolic alkalosis (elevated bicarbonate), also consistent with excessive vomiting. Although her calcium level is slightly low, this might be secondary to malnutrition. Thus, the combination of psychological, physical, and laboratory findings make bulimia nervosa the most likely diagnosis.","Bulimia nervosa



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include major depressive disorder, anorexia nervosa, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Specifically, the presence of calluses on the knuckles is often seen in bulimia nervosa due to self-induced vomiting, known as Russell's sign. However, the lack of binge eating episodes in the history provided points more towards anorexia nervosa. Additionally, her mother's history of major depressive disorder can be relevant as mood disorders are often comorbid with eating disorders. Furthermore, the decreased potassium (hypokalemia) and slightly elevated bicarbonate levels could be related to compensatory changes due to malnutrition and the possibility of purging behaviors. Her body mass index (BMI) is also on the lower side (20th percentile), another hint towards anorexia nervosa.

",N,"This patient presents with weight loss, isolation, lack of friends, and a mother with a history of major depressive disorder, which may suggest psychological distress. The clinical findings of dry skin, brittle nails, calluses on the knuckles (Russell's sign), and the below-average body mass index (BMI) for her age are suggestive of a disorder characterized by self-induced starvation. These symptoms together strongly indicate anorexia nervosa. Furthermore, the laboratory studies show electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia (K+ 3.2 mEq/L, normally 3.5-5 mEq/L), and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 30 mEq/L, normally 22-28 mEq/L), which can result from malnutrition and purging behaviors often associated with this condition.

In the context of the patient's progressive symptoms and the presence of both upper motor neuron (increased deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar response) and lower motor neuron signs (atrophy of sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, decreased strength), this is indicative of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

The bilateral involvement of both upper and lower extremities, combined with sensory loss below a certain spinal level, is highly suggestive of a spinal cord syndrome. Given the chronicity and progression of the symptoms, cervical spondylotic myelopathy is a likely cause. This condition is a result of age-related changes that cause narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck region (cervical spondylosis), which compresses the spinal cord over time and leads to a variety of neurological symptoms.

Given her age, the chronic progressive nature of her symptoms, and the combination of motor and sensory signs, a likely diagnosis would be cervical spondylotic myelopathy. This is a condition caused by degenerative changes in the vertebrae and intervertebral discs of the cervical spine leading to compression of the spinal cord. The chronic compression leads to damage of the spinal cord and causes the symptoms observed in this patient, such as weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, and sensory changes.
","Cervical spondylotic myelopathy.



",Y,"This is a step-by-step Bayesian inference:

The prior probability of a diagnosis of ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) in this case could be around 1%, considering it's relatively rare.
The patient's symptom of progressive extremity weakness, ataxic gait, and dysarthria increases the probability of ALS to 20%. These are consistent with both upper and lower motor neuron signs, a characteristic of ALS.
Spasticity and extensor response to plantar reflex testing (Babinski sign) increases the probability to 40%. These are signs of upper motor neuron dysfunction.
Muscular atrophy (indicative of lower motor neuron loss) and dysphagia further increases the likelihood to 60%. ALS leads to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, and difficulties with speech and swallowing due to bulbar muscle involvement.
The sensory deficit (decreased sensation below the C5 dermatome) initially confuses the picture as ALS typically doesn't involve sensory deficits. However, given the pattern of symptoms and the atrophy of specific neck muscles (sternocleidomastoid and trapezius), the patient likely has a concurrent condition such as a cervical spondylotic myelopathy. This doesn't decrease the probability of ALS but does suggest another concurrent condition.

The pale, white retina with a cherry-red spot at the macula, seen on fundoscopy, is a characteristic finding in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO is a condition where the flow of blood through the central retinal artery is blocked, typically due to an embolus.

The bright red spot in the macula, known as the ""cherry-red spot,"" is characteristic of CRAO and represents the fovea, where the retina is thin enough for the choroidal circulation to show through. The patient's history of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and past myocardial infarction, increases her risk for CRAO. In addition, the history of carotid endarterectomy indicates a history of carotid artery disease, which is a risk factor for embolic CRAO.

He was the helmeted driver of a scooter hit by a truck. On arrival, he is alert and oriented with a Glasgow Coma Scale rating of 14. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 103/min, respirations are 33/min and blood pressure is 132/88 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over his abdomen and extremities. There is a 2.5-cm (1-in) laceration on the left side of the chest. There are decreased breath sounds over the left base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and there is tenderness to palpation over the left upper quadrant. Bowel sounds are normal. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.6 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,110/mm3, and platelet count is 190,000/mm3. A chest x-ray is shown. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Diaphragmatic rupture,Pneumothorax,N,Pneumothorax,N,Pneumothorax,N,Pneumothorax,N,Pneumothorax,N,,"Given the information presented, we can proceed with a deduction. This is a patient with respiratory symptoms following a high-speed motor vehicle collision. These symptoms include shortness of breath and chest pain. Additionally, the physical examination shows decreased breath sounds over the left base of the lung, indicating a possible injury in that area.

The presence of a laceration on the left side of the chest and the history of the patient being in a high-speed collision suggest the possibility of a traumatic injury to the chest. Furthermore, the tender left upper quadrant of the abdomen could suggest injury to the spleen or left diaphragm, which is often associated with left-sided chest injuries.

As the question mentions a chest x-ray but does not show it, we can reasonably infer that this x-ray might show findings consistent with our deduced diagnosis. Given all these clues, a highly probable diagnosis would be a traumatic pneumothorax, hemothorax, or a combination of both (hemopneumothorax), especially considering the decreased breath sounds on one side of the chest which is a common clinical feature.","Pneumothorax or Hemopneumothorax



",N,"The rationale for this patient involves understanding the symptoms, examination findings, and the history of recent trauma. We can consider several possibilities including rib fractures, pulmonary contusion, tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, and flail chest. Given the mechanism of injury (high-speed motor vehicle collision), the fact that the patient has decreased breath sounds on the left side, the presence of a laceration on the chest, and without knowing the exact result of the chest x-ray, the most likely diagnosis is a pneumothorax or hemothorax.

However, without the chest x-ray image, it's hard to definitively diagnose this case.

Assuming the chest x-ray shows a partial or complete collapse of the left lung, with absence of lung markings peripherally, and a shift of mediastinal structures away from the affected side, these findings would be consistent with a pneumothorax. Alternatively, if the x-ray showed an opacification (fluid or blood) in the pleural space with possible shift of the mediastinal structures away from the affected side, it could indicate a hemothorax.","Pneumothorax or Hemothorax (Assuming the chest x-ray is consistent with one of these diagnoses)



",N,"The patient has suffered a high-speed motor vehicle accident, which raises suspicion for traumatic injury. Decreased breath sounds on the left could indicate that air (pneumothorax) or blood (hemothorax) is filling the pleural space and impeding lung expansion. The presence of a laceration on the left side of the chest further supports this possibility.

Without an x-ray, I can't be definitive, but based on the clinical context, these are two likely considerations.","Pneumothorax or Hemothorax



",N,"The patient has just been involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The chest trauma, reduced breath sounds over the left base, and the left-sided chest laceration suggest a possible lung injury. This could potentially be a pneumothorax (collapse of the lung) or a hemothorax (blood in the pleural space), especially since these conditions are common complications of chest trauma and would align with the patient's decreased oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate. Also, the abdominal tenderness, particularly in the left upper quadrant could suggest splenic injury which is also common in high-speed motor vehicle collisions. However, a definite diagnosis would require imaging results such as the chest x-ray and potentially an abdominal CT scan.","Possible pneumothorax/hemothorax and splenic injury



",N,"The prior probability of a pneumothorax is relatively high in patients involved in high-speed motor vehicle accidents due to potential chest trauma. Let's say this is 15%.
The presence of a chest laceration further increases the posterior probability of pneumothorax. Given that chest lacerations can lead to punctured lungs, this raises the probability to 40%.
Decreased breath sounds over the left base, as mentioned in the case, often indicate a pneumothorax. This further raises the probability to 70%.
Shortness of breath and chest pain after trauma, which are common symptoms of a pneumothorax, increase the probability even further to around 90%.
The patient's relatively high respiration rate could also be indicative of a pneumothorax. This maintains the probability at around 90%.","Pneumothorax.

He also has a murmur over the left upper sternal border and left upper quadrant tenderness, possibly signifying splenic involvement, which is a common finding in infective endocarditis. The leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) is indicative of a systemic infection. Given his history and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is Infective Endocarditis.
","Infective Endocarditis



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: infective endocarditis, myocarditis, septicemia, splenic abscess, or splenic infarction. Given the patient's history of IV drug use, septic shock, fever, a new murmur, and leukocytosis, the clinical picture is suggestive of infective endocarditis. The left upper quadrant tenderness could also indicate a septic embolism to the spleen causing splenic infarction or abscess, but these conditions are often a result of complications from infective endocarditis in IV drug users.
","Infective Endocarditis



",N,"This patient has a history of IV drug abuse, which places him at risk for infective endocarditis. The fever, elevated heart rate (tachycardia), and the presence of a new murmur (possible heart valve abnormality) are supportive of this diagnosis. Additionally, the elevated leukocyte count suggests an ongoing infection. Tenderness in the left upper quadrant could be related to spleen involvement, which can occur in infective endocarditis due to septic emboli. Given this patient's clinical presentation and past medical history, the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis.
","Infective Endocarditis



",N,"This patient's fever, abdominal pain, and history of intravenous drug use, along with the murmur heard over the left upper sternal border (indicative of valvular abnormalities), suggest infective endocarditis (IE). This is an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart, usually the valves, often seen in intravenous drug users due to the risk of introducing bacteria directly into the bloodstream. The abdominal pain and left upper quadrant tenderness could be related to splenic involvement, which can occur in IE due to septic emboli, leading to splenic infarcts or abscesses. The elevated leukocyte count suggests an ongoing systemic infection, also in line with the diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
","Infective Endocarditis



",N,"The prior probability of infective endocarditis in the general population is quite low, less than 1%. However, given the patient's history of IV drug use, the probability of endocarditis should be increased, say to 20%. The presence of a new murmur (especially if it's a regurgitant murmur, which is most typical in endocarditis) further increases the likelihood of endocarditis to 50%. The presence of a fever could increase the likelihood to 60%, and the fact that the patient has had multiple admissions for septic shock could push the likelihood even higher, perhaps to 75%. Abdominal pain and left upper quadrant tenderness may suggest splenic involvement, which can be a complication of infective endocarditis due to emboli, increasing the likelihood to around 85%. Additionally, the leukocyte count is elevated, which is common in infections and further supports the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Therefore, this patient most likely has infective endocarditis.

"A 9-month-old girl is brought in by her father for a scheduled check-up with her pediatrician. He states that over the past 4-5 months she has had multiple ear infections. She was also hospitalized for an upper respiratory infection 2 months ago. Since then she has been well. She has started to pull herself up to walk. Additionally, the patient’s medical history is significant for eczema and allergic rhinitis. The father denies any family history of immunodeficiencies. There are no notable findings on physical exam. Labs are remarkable for low IgG levels with normal IgA, IgE, and IgM levels. What is the most likely etiology for the patient’s presentation?",Delayed onset of normal immunoglobulins,Selective IgG deficiency,N,Selective IgG deficiency,N,Selective IgG Deficiency,N,Primary immunodeficiency,N,Selective IgG deficiency,N,,"The child's medical history is significant for multiple infections (ear and upper respiratory), which indicate an abnormal immune response. The presence of eczema and allergic rhinitis suggests a heightened immune response to environmental allergens. Laboratory findings show low IgG levels while other immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, and IgM) are normal.

Given this combination of findings, the most likely etiology is a selective deficiency of IgG, a subtype of immunodeficiency where a person has normal levels of IgA and IgM, but inadequate levels of IgG. This leads to an increased susceptibility to infections, as IgG is the most abundant immunoglobulin and plays a crucial role in immune defense, especially against encapsulated bacteria that often cause ear and respiratory infections.","Selective IgG deficiency.



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), selective IgA deficiency, selective IgG deficiency, transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI), and IgG subclass deficiency.

Given the age of the patient, her history of recurrent infections (ear infections and upper respiratory infection), and the laboratory findings of low IgG with normal IgA, IgE, and IgM levels, this makes certain diagnoses more likely.

Selective IgA deficiency and IgG subclass deficiency can be ruled out because the IgA and IgE levels are normal. CVID typically presents later in life, around adolescence or early adulthood, and it's characterized by low levels of IgG, IgA, and often IgM, which is not the case here.

The most likely diagnosis in this case would be transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI). THI is a condition seen in children between six months and 3 years of age where the immune system does not produce enough antibodies, particularly IgG. It is usually characterized by recurrent infections, which resolves by itself as the child's immune system matures.","Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy



",Y,"This patient's history of multiple infections, particularly of the ear and upper respiratory tract, combined with low levels of IgG (an antibody that plays a crucial role in fighting bacterial and viral infections) despite normal levels of IgA, IgE, and IgM, suggests an immunodeficiency. In the context of her age (being less than a year old) and the pattern of immunoglobulin abnormalities, she is likely to have Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy (THI). THI is a condition that typically affects infants where there is a delay in the maturation of B-lymphocyte function leading to decreased levels of immunoglobulin, particularly IgG. This exposes the child to a higher risk of infections, particularly of the upper respiratory tract.","Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Infancy



",Y,"The child's history of multiple ear infections and a severe upper respiratory infection, along with eczema and allergic rhinitis, suggests an immune deficiency. The laboratory results indicate low levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is the most common type of antibody and is crucial in fighting bacterial and viral infections. Normal levels of IgA, IgE, and IgM rule out conditions like Selective IgA Deficiency and Hyper IgM syndrome. The patient's age is also a clue: infants produce low levels of IgG until about 6 months of age, after which levels should rise. The most likely diagnosis in this case is Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), a disorder that impairs the immune system's ability to produce antibodies, particularly IgG, leading to recurrent infections.","Common Variable Immunodeficiency



",N,"The prior probability of an immunoglobulin disorder in this patient is relatively low given the age and absence of any noted familial history. However, recurrent ear infections and upper respiratory infections are suggestive of immune deficiencies and increase the probability of an immunoglobulin disorder.

The patient's medical history also includes eczema and allergic rhinitis. These conditions are frequently associated with immune disorders, further raising the probability.

The final and most significant piece of evidence comes from the lab results. The IgG (immunoglobulin G) levels are notably low while the IgA, IgE, and IgM levels are within the normal range. This highly suggests a selective IgG deficiency, which is an immune disorder that leaves individuals susceptible to infections, particularly in the respiratory tract.

This specific pattern of low IgG with normal IgA, IgE, and IgM levels is consistent with a specific type of immune deficiency known as Selective IgG Subclass Deficiency. It's characterized by normal total IgG levels but decreased levels of one or two IgG subclasses, and can lead to recurrent infections as observed in the patient.

Overall, the posterior probability of Selective IgG Subclass Deficiency is high given the patient's history, symptoms, and lab findings.","Selective IgG Subclass Deficiency.

His history of diabetes and hypertension places him at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. The systolic murmur heard along the right upper sternal border suggests an issue with blood flow during ventricular contraction. The most likely diagnosis considering these signs and symptoms, especially the presence of a systolic murmur at this location, is aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is a condition where the heart's aortic valve narrows, preventing normal blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta, causing symptoms such as fatigue, light-headedness, and sometimes fainting. This is especially likely considering his age, as aortic stenosis is often due to age-related calcification.","Aortic stenosis.



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes aortic stenosis, hypertensive heart disease, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and orthostatic hypotension. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, lightheadedness with activity, and syncope (fainting) are concerning for cardiovascular disease. Given his age, past medical history (including hypertension), and the physical exam finding of a systolic murmur best heard along the right upper sternal border, this is suggestive of aortic stenosis. The murmur associated with aortic stenosis is often systolic and best heard along the upper right sternal border due to the outflow of blood from the heart through the aorta. The lack of ST elevation on the ECG and negative cardiac troponins argue against an acute myocardial infarction. Hence, based on his presentation, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is aortic stenosis.","Aortic Stenosis



",Y,"This patient's presentation of abnormal fatigue, light-headedness during physical exertion (gardening), a single fainting event, along with a systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border suggest a cardiac etiology. The absence of ST elevation on ECG and negative cardiac troponins rule out acute coronary syndromes such as myocardial infarction. The murmur described and the patient's symptoms are most consistent with aortic stenosis, a condition where the aortic valve becomes narrowed and limits blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. This condition commonly presents in older patients and can lead to symptoms such as fatigue and light-headedness or syncope during exertion as the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the narrowed valve.
","Aortic Stenosis



",Y,"The systolic murmur best heard along the right upper sternal border, along with symptoms such as abnormal fatigue, lightheadedness, and fainting, is suggestive of aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis can occur due to calcification of the aortic valve, commonly seen in older adults and those with risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, both of which are present in this patient. Aortic stenosis can cause decreased cardiac output leading to symptoms of lightheadedness and fainting, particularly during exertion such as gardening, due to reduced blood flow to the brain. The absence of ST elevations or positive cardiac troponins indicates this is not an acute myocardial infarction. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is aortic stenosis.
","Aortic stenosis



",Y,"The initial probability of aortic stenosis in this patient, given his age and symptoms, might be around 10%. The presence of fatigue and lightheadedness, symptoms often associated with aortic stenosis due to reduced cardiac output, might increase this probability to 20%. The reported syncope, another symptom that can be associated with severe aortic stenosis, could further increase the probability to 30%. The physical exam revealing a systolic murmur best heard along the right upper sternal border, which is consistent with the murmur of aortic stenosis, might increase the probability to 70%. The absence of signs of myocardial infarction on the ECG and the negative troponins, which make ischemic heart disease less likely, could increase the posterior probability of aortic stenosis to 80%.

This combination of anemia, neutropenia, splenomegaly, and rheumatoid arthritis suggests the possibility of Felty's syndrome. Felty's syndrome is a rare complication of rheumatoid arthritis characterized by these findings. It's important to note that the lack of varicose veins helps rule out venous insufficiency, which could also cause leg ulcers.

",Y,"This patient's symptoms suggest multiple potential causes including vasculitis, venous stasis, methotrexate toxicity, or Felty syndrome. Vasculitis and venous stasis usually come with other symptoms such as visible inflammation or varicose veins respectively which are not present in this patient. Methotrexate toxicity would typically affect liver function and show increased liver enzymes, but her liver function tests are within normal range.

",Y,"This patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis has developed chronic leg ulcers, which could be a sign of vasculitis, a condition commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Vasculitis can lead to damage and inflammation of the blood vessels, which can impair blood supply to the skin and cause ulcers. In addition, this patient's low neutrophil count (neutropenia) and low hemoglobin level (anemia) with microcytosis (MCV <80 fL) could be side effects of methotrexate, a drug that is commonly used to treat severe rheumatoid arthritis but can cause myelosuppression, leading to cytopenias, and hepatotoxicity as noted by the slightly elevated liver enzymes (alanine and aspartate aminotransferases). The patient's palpable spleen tip could also be indicative of splenomegaly, another potential side effect of long-term methotrexate use. Hence, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is methotrexate toxicity.

",N,"The patient has a history of severe rheumatoid arthritis, and is being treated with methotrexate, an immunosuppressant that is known to cause side effects including myelosuppression (evidenced by the low white blood cell count and slightly decreased hemoglobin) and hepatotoxicity (evidenced by elevated liver enzymes). The leg ulcers, particularly in the absence of varicose veins, can also be attributed to immunosuppression and potentially poor peripheral circulation. The presence of a palpable spleen may suggest hypersplenism, which can lead to peripheral sequestration and destruction of blood cells, thus potentially contributing to the hematological abnormalities. The low MCV suggests a microcytic anemia, which may be the result of chronic disease. Therefore, this patient's condition is most likely due to the side effects of methotrexate treatment.
","Methotrexate side effects

Second, her laboratory results reveal a low white blood cell count (neutropenia) with a particular reduction in neutrophils, which further increases the probability to 30%. The patient's ongoing rheumatoid arthritis, especially severe and long-lasting, makes Felty's syndrome more probable, pushing the posterior probability to 50%.

Clostridium botulinum spores are heat-resistant and, when ingested, can germinate in the anaerobic conditions of the infant's gut, producing the neurotoxin.

Raw honey is a known potential source of Clostridium botulinum spores, which when ingested, can germinate, multiply, and produce toxin in the infant's immature gut. The botulinum toxin interferes with neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction, leading to the clinical symptoms observed.

",N,"The presentation of this infant with weakness, spasms, difficulty feeding, weak suck and no fever is very suggestive of botulism. Infants can contract botulism when they ingest spores of the bacterium, which can be found in soil, dust, or certain foods like honey. Once in the gut of the infant, the spores germinate and the bacteria begin producing the botulinum toxin. This toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, causing a descending, symmetric flaccid paralysis. The presentation of these symptoms, especially in conjunction with the potential exposure to raw honey, makes Clostridium botulinum the most likely causal organism.
","Clostridium botulinum.



",N,"This infant is presenting with muscle stiffness, twitches, and a weak suck, which are classic signs of botulism in infants, also known as floppy baby syndrome. The condition is typically caused by the ingestion of spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can be found in contaminated foods such as honey. Once ingested, the spores germinate in the infant's immature gut and release a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, causing the characteristic symptoms. The fact that the mother mentions possible honey ingestion points strongly towards this diagnosis.","Clostridium botulinum



",N,"The prior probability of botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum is relatively low in the general infant population, let's say at about 0.1%. However, the patient's exposure to raw honey, a known potential source of botulinum spores, raises the posterior probability to, say, 5%. The presence of neurological symptoms (weakness, spasms, difficulty feeding, weak suck) further increases the probability to 50%. The absence of other signs of systemic illness (no fever, cough, diarrhea, or vomiting) and the fact that botulism primarily affects the neuromuscular junction and typically presents without such systemic signs, raises the posterior probability to perhaps 80%. The patient's young age (10 days old) and the fact that infant botulism usually presents between the first week and several months of life, raises the probability to around 90%. The fact that Clostridium botulinum is well-known to be associated with honey and neurological symptoms in infants, I conclude that this is the most likely causative organism.

This condition is caused by the JC virus, typically in patients with severely impaired immune function, such as those with AIDS. The clinical features also match with PML, which often presents with motor weakness, visual symptoms, and cognitive/behavioral changes. The atypical astrocytes and demyelination are also characteristic of PML. Toxoplasmosis, another common opportunistic infection in HIV patients, typically causes enhancing lesions with mass effect on MRI. CNS lymphoma, which is also associated with HIV, typically presents with single or multiple enhancing masses, often in periventricular areas. HIV-associated dementia would not typically present with such localizable neurologic symptoms and signs (e.g., unilateral weakness, diplopia) or with white matter lesions on imaging.

One week ago, she was diagnosed with influenza when she had fevers, severe headaches, myalgias, hip and shoulder pain, and a maculopapular rash. After a day of relative remission, she developed abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. A single episode of hematemesis occurred prior to admission. Two weeks ago she visited rainforests and caves in western Africa where she had direct contact with animals, including apes. She has no history of serious illnesses or use of medications. She is restless and her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F); pulse, 95/min; respirations, 20/min; and supine and upright blood pressure, 130/70 mm Hg and 100/65 mm Hg, respectively. Conjunctival suffusion is seen. Ecchymoses are observed on the lower extremities. She is bleeding from one of her intravenous lines. The peripheral blood smear is negative for organisms. The laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 10 g/dL

What is the most likely causal pathogen?",Ebola virus,Marburg virus,Y,Ebola virus,Y,Marburg virus,Y,Yellow fever,N,Marburg virus,Y,,"The patient is presenting with symptoms of fever, severe headache, myalgia, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and hematemesis (vomiting blood), confusion, conjunctival suffusion, ecchymoses (bruising), bleeding from IV sites, and lab abnormalities such as low hemoglobin, low leukocyte count, low platelet count, prolonged clotting times, and elevated liver enzymes and creatinine. These are signs of a systemic infection leading to multiorgan dysfunction, with notable features of coagulopathy and hemorrhagic tendencies. The recent travel history to Africa and direct contact with animals, specifically apes, further suggest a zoonotic infection.

Considering the clinical presentation and the epidemiological context, the most likely pathogen responsible for these symptoms is the Ebola virus. Ebola virus disease typically presents with a sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and impaired kidney and liver function. In severe cases, it progresses to hemorrhagic symptoms, including spontaneous bleeding or bleeding from injection sites, and multiple organ dysfunction, as seen in this patient. Additionally, Ebola is endemic in certain regions of Africa, and transmission to humans can occur through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as apes.","Ebola virus



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes several severe infectious diseases such as sepsis, dengue, malaria, Marburg virus, Ebola virus, and leptospirosis. All these diseases could potentially cause the symptoms of high fever, confusion, hematemesis, and ecchymoses on the lower extremities.

However, in assessing the epidemiological context, the patient's recent travel history to western Africa and her direct contact with apes makes viral hemorrhagic fevers, specifically Marburg and Ebola viruses, a significant concern. Both Marburg and Ebola viruses are zoonotic diseases and are associated with contact with bats and non-human primates.

The patient's clinical presentation includes features of hemorrhagic fever with multi-organ involvement, such as hematemesis, ecchymosis, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired kidney function. The presence of thrombocytopenia, prolonged clotting times, and positive fibrin split products indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a common complication of viral hemorrhagic fevers.

Between Marburg and Ebola, the detail of the patient being a ""forest landscape specialist"" can lean towards Ebola, as Marburg is more associated with caves and mines (specifically, with bats in these areas).

Based on the aforementioned factors, the patient is more likely suffering from Ebola Virus Disease.","Ebola virus



",Y,"This patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of a hemorrhagic fever, specifically Ebola virus disease. The patient's recent travel to Africa, particularly to rainforests and caves where she had direct contact with animals, is a notable risk factor. The Ebola virus is known to circulate in certain animal populations in this region, particularly bats, and can be transmitted to humans. In terms of symptoms, the patient's flu-like symptoms, bleeding, gastrointestinal symptoms, and confusion are consistent with Ebola. In addition, the laboratory studies show findings consistent with Ebola, such as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and signs of coagulopathy (prolonged partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, positive fibrin split products).
","Ebola Virus



",Y,"This patient presents with a range of symptoms including fevers, headaches, myalgias, rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, confusion, restlessness, ecchymoses, and bleeding, which are all consistent with severe hemorrhagic fever. Given her recent travel to a rainforest in western Africa and direct contact with animals, including apes, the most likely causal pathogen is the Ebola virus. This is further supported by her laboratory findings, which include thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), coagulopathy (elevated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time, and positive fibrin split products), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and elevated liver enzymes, all typical of Ebola virus disease.
","Ebola virus.



",Y,"The prior probability of a Marburg or Ebola infection, which are types of filovirus, is quite low in the general population. However, this patient has a recent travel history to Western Africa, a region where such viruses are endemic, and had direct contact with animals, including apes, which are known carriers. This significantly raises the likelihood of a filovirus infection, let's say to 20%.

The patient's symptomatology includes fever, severe headache, myalgia, maculopapular rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and hematemesis, which are all consistent with a filovirus infection. Given these symptoms, the probability of a filovirus infection further increases, let's say to 50%.

Furthermore, the patient's lab results indicate a low leukocyte count (suggesting an infection), low platelet count (suggesting a coagulopathy), prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (also suggesting a coagulopathy), and positive fibrin split products (suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation). These findings are characteristic of a filovirus infection, raising the probability even further, let's say to 75%.

Additionally, the liver function tests are abnormal (increased ALT, AST, and GGT), which is consistent with a filovirus infection, further increasing the likelihood, let's say to 85%.

Lastly, the absence of organisms on the peripheral blood smear helps to rule out other causes of similar symptoms, such as malaria. Given all these considerations, a filovirus infection is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.","Filovirus

"A 33-year-old African American woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness checkup. She states that she has lost 20 pounds over the past 2 months yet has experienced an increased appetite during this period. She endorses hyperhidrosis and increased urinary volume and frequency. Physical exam is notable for an anxious woman and a regular and tachycardic pulse. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL

The patient's urine calcium level is elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hyperthyroidism,Primary hyperparathyroidism,N,Hyperthyroidism,Y,Hyperparathyroidism,N,Hyperthyroidism,Y,Hyperparathyroidism,N,,"This patient has several symptoms suggestive of an endocrine disorder. Specifically, her weight loss, despite increased appetite, along with symptoms of excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis), increased urinary volume and frequency, tachycardia, and an anxious appearance are characteristic of hyperthyroidism, an overactivity of the thyroid gland.

However, her laboratory results indicate a high calcium level, which is not typical for hyperthyroidism but is a key marker for hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by overactivity of the parathyroid glands, leading to excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH acts to increase blood calcium levels by promoting the release of calcium from bones, increasing the kidneys' reabsorption of calcium, and indirectly increasing intestinal absorption of calcium. It also increases urinary phosphate excretion, which can contribute to an increased frequency of urination.

In addition, hyperparathyroidism can result in bone pain, kidney stones, and psychiatric manifestations due to high calcium levels, including anxiety, which can also be seen in this patient.

Therefore, considering the clinical presentation and the laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis in this case is primary hyperparathyroidism.","Primary Hyperparathyroidism



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism, and anxiety disorders. The patient's weight loss, increased appetite, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and anxiety-like symptoms could suggest hyperthyroidism, while her increased urinary volume and frequency could suggest diabetes mellitus.

However, her normal serum sodium, chloride, potassium, bicarbonate levels argue against diabetes mellitus and the other options mentioned, but her elevated serum calcium (normal range is approximately 8.5-10.2 mg/dL) and increased urine calcium level point towards hyperparathyroidism.

In hyperparathyroidism, the parathyroid glands produce excess parathyroid hormone (PTH), leading to elevated levels of calcium in the blood. This happens because PTH increases the release of calcium from the bones into the bloodstream, enhances absorption of calcium in the gut, and reduces loss of calcium in the urine. The excess calcium can then cause a variety of symptoms, including some of those experienced by this patient, such as increased urinary frequency and volume (as the kidneys try to get rid of the excess calcium), as well as neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety.

Given the combination of her symptoms and the laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is hyperparathyroidism.","Hyperparathyroidism



",N,"This patient's presentation of weight loss, increased appetite, excessive sweating, and increased urinary volume and frequency suggest a hypermetabolic state. Additionally, the physical exam findings of anxiety and tachycardia could also point towards a hypermetabolic condition. Furthermore, the labs show hypercalcemia (normal serum calcium levels range between 8.5 and 10.5 mg/dL). Hypercalcemia can cause polyuria and polydipsia due to decreased responsiveness of the kidney to antidiuretic hormone, thus explaining the increased urinary volume and frequency. All these signs and symptoms point towards primary hyperthyroidism, which is also associated with increased urinary calcium excretion leading to hypercalciuria, observed in the patient's labs.
","Primary Hyperthyroidism



",Y,"This patient presents with weight loss despite an increased appetite, symptoms of hyperhidrosis, increased urinary volume and frequency, and an anxious demeanor, all of which can be associated with hyperthyroidism. However, her elevated calcium levels and increased urine calcium levels suggest hypercalcemia, which is not typical of hyperthyroidism. These signs can suggest a condition known as primary hyperparathyroidism, which results from overactive parathyroid glands that secrete too much parathyroid hormone. This hormone helps regulate the body's levels of calcium and phosphorous. When too much is secreted, it causes hypercalcemia by causing too much calcium to be released from the bones into the bloodstream and reducing the amount of calcium excreted in the urine. In this patient, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism could potentially be due to thyrotoxicosis as a result of the parathyroid adenoma secreting thyroid-stimulating hormone or it could be due to an unrelated co-existing hyperthyroid condition.
","Primary Hyperparathyroidism



",N,"Step 1: We start with the prior probabilities of diseases that could cause the symptoms and findings in the patient. Given the symptoms of weight loss, increased appetite, hyperhidrosis, increased urination, and increased pulse, as well as the race of the patient, we should consider hyperthyroidism (prior probability 5%), hyperparathyroidism (prior probability 5%), and diabetes mellitus (prior probability 10%).

Step 2: Next, we consider the patient's elevated serum calcium and urine calcium levels. Elevated calcium levels are commonly seen in hyperparathyroidism, which increases the posterior probability of hyperparathyroidism to 60%, whereas hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus are less likely to directly cause hypercalcemia, leaving their probabilities relatively unchanged.

Step 3: Hyperparathyroidism can present with ""stones, bones, groans, and psychic moans,"" referring to kidney stones (caused by hypercalciuria), bone pain (from bone resorption), abdominal groans (constipation, nausea, etc.), and psychic moans (mood changes, etc.). Although this patient does not have all these symptoms, the presence of increased urinary frequency can be a subtle sign of kidney stone activity, and the anxious mood can be a sign of psychic moans.

Step 4: No other significant changes to the probabilities based on the given information.

Based on the Bayesian inference, the most likely diagnosis is hyperparathyroidism due to increased serum and urine calcium levels, consistent with the patient's presentation.","Hyperparathyroidism

"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of low-grade fever and progressive painful lumps in his right groin for 6 days. The lumps have been discharging purulent fluid since the evening of the previous day. He had a shallow, painless lesion on his penis 3 weeks ago, but was too embarrassed to seek medical attention; it has resolved in the meantime. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 12 years. He is sexually active with multiple male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F). Examination of his groin shows multiple masses discharging pus. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely causal organism?",Chlamydia trachomatis,Chlamydia trachomatis,Y,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,N,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,N,Haemophilus ducreyi,N,Gonorrhea,N,,"This patient's symptoms suggest he has a sexually transmitted infection (STI). His history of a painless genital ulcer that has resolved and new painful lymphadenopathy in his groin (buboes) are typical of secondary stage of syphilis. However, his symptoms could also be consistent with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by certain strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. Given his history of a painless ulcer and the presence of purulent discharge from lymph nodes in the groin, LGV is a better fit than syphilis. This is because secondary syphilis usually presents with a rash, not painful lymphadenopathy.
","Chlamydia trachomatis



",Y,"Given the patient's history and physical examination, the differential diagnoses for the causal organism could include Treponema pallidum (syphilis), Chlamydia trachomatis (lymphogranuloma venereum), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea), or Herpes simplex virus. The shallow, painless lesion on his penis that resolved spontaneously suggests a chancre, which is indicative of primary syphilis caused by T. pallidum. However, syphilis doesn't typically cause painful lumps or abscesses. The presentation of low-grade fever, painful lymphadenopathy in the groin, and the formation of abscesses that discharge pus is most consistent with lymphogranuloma venereum caused by specific serovars of C. trachomatis.
","Chlamydia trachomatis



",Y,"The man's sexual history, the timing and presentation of his symptoms, with a painless penile lesion 3 weeks ago followed by painful inguinal (groin) lumps and discharge, are highly indicative of the second stage of syphilis, characterized by skin rashes and mucous membrane lesions. The causative agent of syphilis is Treponema pallidum, a spirochete bacterium.
","Treponema pallidum



",N,"The history and clinical presentation of this patient strongly suggest the presence of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). His fever and discharging inguinal lymph nodes indicate an active infection. He reports a prior, painless genital ulcer that resolved spontaneously, which is characteristic of primary syphilis caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. However, his clinical signs at this time suggest a progression to the second stage of the disease, which is characterized by systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. Alternatively, the pus discharging from the lymph nodes could indicate lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by certain serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. However, the painless genital ulcer described is not typically seen in LGV, making this diagnosis less likely. Therefore, the most likely causative organism is Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis.
","Treponema pallidum



",N,"The prior probability of an infection with Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis, is relatively low in the general population, let's say 0.5%. However, this patient's history and symptoms point towards sexually transmitted infections. The presence of the shallow, painless lesion on his penis (which is characteristic of a syphilis chancre) increases the posterior probability of a Treponema pallidum infection to 40%. His lifestyle risk factor of having multiple sexual partners with inconsistent condom use further increases the probability to 70%. Furthermore, the development of painful lumps in his groin discharging pus is suggestive of secondary syphilis (specifically, the symptom known as ""buboes""), which further increases the posterior probability to 90%.

"A 17-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. The patient has had headaches in the past, but she describes this as the worst headache of her life. Her symptoms started yesterday and have been getting progressively worse. The patient states that the pain is mostly on one side of her head. There has been a recent outbreak of measles at the patient’s school, and the patient’s mother has been trying to give her daughter medicine to prevent her from getting sick, but the mother fears that her daughter may have caught the measles. On physical exam, you note an obese young girl who is clutching her head with the light in the room turned off. Her neurological exam is within normal limits.

She is also noted to be obese and exhibits photophobia (as she is in a dark room), papilledema (as noted on fundoscopic exam), and elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture. Despite a potential measles outbreak at her school, her symptoms do not align with typical presentations of measles, but are more consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. This condition is often found in obese women of childbearing age and can present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache and visual changes (due to papilledema). The fact that the MRI of the head revealed cerebral edema but a normal glucose level in the cerebrospinal fluid also supports this diagnosis.

Meningitis could present with headache, but is often accompanied by fever and neck stiffness, which this patient does not have. Subarachnoid hemorrhage presents as a sudden severe headache, but this usually doesn't progressively worsen over a day, and there's typically an acute event or trigger. A brain tumor could cause headaches and papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure, but the MRI, in this case, didn't reveal any mass effect. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is often seen in obese young women and presents with severe headache, papilledema, and a normal neurological examination.

This condition is most common in obese women of childbearing age, a demographic that this patient fits. In IIH, the exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be due to increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production or decreased CSF absorption, leading to increased intracranial pressure. The cerebral edema seen on MRI can be secondary to the increased intracranial pressure. The headache is often described as the worst of the patient's life and may be associated with visual disturbances. Importantly, the patient's neurologic exam is typically normal in IIH, except for possibly some visual disturbances or a sixth cranial nerve palsy.

An MRI revealing cerebral edema is a common finding in IIH, increasing the probability to 85%.

Both his parents are of normal height. On physical examination, he is a well-fed, well-developed male and his vital signs are within normal range. His physical examination is completely normal. His sexual development corresponds to Tanner stage 2. Analysis of his growth charts suggests that his height and weight at birth were within normal range. After the age of six months, his height and weight curves drifted further from average and approached the 5th percentile. An X-ray of the patient’s left hand reveals delayed bone age. What is the most likely cause of short stature in the boy?",Constitutional growth delay,Constitutional growth delay,Y,Growth hormone deficiency,N,Growth hormone deficiency,N,Growth hormone deficiency,N,Growth hormone deficiency,N,,"This 15-year-old male patient presents with a height less than his peers, despite his parents being of normal height. His growth chart indicates a gradual decrease in his growth percentile, rather than a sudden drop, which would suggest an illness or malnutrition. His physical examination is normal, ruling out most systemic diseases or malnutrition. The Tanner stage 2 suggests a delay in puberty, which is consistent with his delayed bone age observed in the hand X-ray. Given these findings, the most likely cause of short stature in this case is constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a common cause of short stature and delayed puberty in adolescents that is often familial and has a good prognosis.
","Constitutional delay of growth and puberty



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for short stature includes: constitutional delay of growth and puberty, familial short stature, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome (in girls), chronic diseases such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease, and psychosocial short stature.

Constitutional delay of growth and puberty: This is characterized by short stature, delayed skeletal maturity (as evidenced by the X-ray showing delayed bone age), and delayed onset of secondary sexual characteristics. However, these individuals have normal growth velocity and eventually reach a normal adult height. The patient's Tanner stage suggests delayed puberty, which is consistent with constitutional delay.

Familial short stature: Here the height of the child is normal for his family, which does not seem to be the case as the parents are of normal height.

Hypothyroidism: This could cause delayed growth and bone age, but typically presents with symptoms such as constipation, dry skin, cold intolerance, and fatigue. The child's history does not suggest these symptoms.

Growth hormone deficiency: This would result in decreased growth velocity leading to short stature and possibly delayed bone age. However, typically, these children would have normal or chubby body proportions and may have immature facial features which is not mentioned in the scenario.

Turner syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities: Not relevant in this case as the patient is male.

Chronic diseases like celiac or inflammatory bowel disease could lead to short stature but these usually come with other signs and symptoms such as gastrointestinal symptoms or failure to thrive which are not present in this case.

Psychosocial short stature, which is rare, results from severe emotional deprivation or stress. There's no indication of such issues in the history provided.

Given the information provided, the most likely cause of short stature in this boy is a constitutional delay of growth and puberty. His bone age is delayed, which suggests that he still has potential for growth. Furthermore, the fact that he is in Tanner stage 2 suggests that he is just beginning puberty, which is later than average, consistent with a constitutional delay.
",Constitutional delay of growth and puberty.,Y,"This patient presents with short stature compared to his peers but no evidence of systemic disease or dysmorphic features. Both his parents have normal height, suggesting that the cause of his short stature is not familial short stature. His growth curve shows a decrease in growth velocity since the age of six months, which is more suggestive of a systemic cause rather than a constitutional growth delay. The fact that he is well-fed and well-developed indicates that malnutrition is not the cause. His delayed bone age, as shown on X-ray, further supports a systemic cause rather than constitutional growth delay, as constitutional growth delay would show a proportional delay in both chronological age and bone age. Given these factors, endocrine issues are the most likely cause of his short stature, specifically hypothyroidism, which can present with short stature and delayed bone age without the typical symptoms if the onset was after the newborn period.
",Hypothyroidism,N,"In this case, the boy has shown normal development at birth but has slowly deviated from the average growth pattern since six months of age. His sexual development corresponds to Tanner stage 2, which is typical for his age. Importantly, his bone age is delayed compared to his chronological age, as indicated by the X-ray. This typically suggests a delay in the secretion of growth hormones, causing him to grow at a slower rate than his peers. There is no mention of systemic disease or malnutrition that could account for his short stature. Also, his parents are of normal height, suggesting a less likely genetic cause for his short stature. Considering all these points, the most likely cause of his short stature is Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty (CDGP), a common cause of short stature and delayed puberty. CDGP means the child is a ""late bloomer"" and will typically catch up to his peers in height during late adolescence when the rest of his peers have stopped growing.
","Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty



",Y,"The prior probability of constitutional growth delay (CGD) given the boy's age, gender, and complaint of short stature is about 20%. His Tanner stage being at 2 for a 15-year-old boy increases the probability of CGD to about 40%, since delayed puberty is common in CGD. The absence of any systemic disease symptoms like weight gain, weight loss, constipation, or dry skin reduces the likelihood of pathological causes of short stature, increasing the probability of CGD to about 60%. The parents being of normal height further supports this, increasing the probability to 80%. Finally, the X-ray showing delayed bone age is highly indicative of CGD, raising the probability to 90%. The patient's growth curve showing a consistent pattern of growth, although at a lower percentile than average, is also typical of CGD. Therefore, the most likely cause of short stature in this boy is constitutional growth delay.

These episodes are interspersed with periods of relatively normal mood. Importantly, these mood episodes are causing distress and interpersonal difficulty, as evidenced by the wife's concerns and confusion about his behavior.

A key feature differentiating bipolar disorder from major depressive disorder is the presence of at least one episode of mania or hypomania. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with borderline personality disorder as there's no history of unstable relationships, self-image, and impulse control.

His brief period of heightened excitability, in which he considered donating all their savings, represents a manic episode. These are both types of episodes are characteristic of Bipolar Disorder.

She also reports experiencing the sensation of hearing her husband's voice, which can be indicative of a grief response. No neurological abnormalities or suicidal ideations are present. This aligns with the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder. However, since these symptoms occurred within a month of a significant loss, her condition can be more appropriately categorized as an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, which typically occurs within three months of the stressor and does not meet the full criteria for Major Depressive Disorder.
",Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood,N,"The differential for this patient includes major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, complicated grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The patient's symptoms of sleep disturbance, sadness, crying spells, and weight loss are consistent with major depressive disorder; however, the context of these symptoms occurring in response to a specific stressful event (i.e., the death of her husband) could suggest adjustment disorder. On the other hand, the occurrence of her symptoms after the death of a loved one, specifically the hallucination of her husband's voice, may suggest complicated grief. PTSD could also be considered given the traumatic nature of her husband's death, but she does not mention experiencing intrusive thoughts or having a heightened startle response, which are common symptoms of PTSD.

The timeline of the symptoms helps distinguish between these conditions. Adjustment disorder symptoms occur within three months of the stressor and typically resolve within six months once the stressor or its consequences have terminated. On the other hand, symptoms of major depressive disorder can occur at any time and are not always associated with an identifiable stressor. Complicated grief, also called persistent complex bereavement disorder, is characterized by prolonged and intense mourning that persists more than 6 months after the death of a loved one.

Considering the 1-month timeline following her husband's death, her symptoms, and the lack of other major depressive disorder or PTSD criteria, the most likely diagnosis is an adjustment disorder.",Adjustment disorder,N,"The patient is experiencing sleep disturbances, sadness, crying spells, weight loss, and hallucinations of hearing her deceased husband's voice, all of which started after her husband's death. She doesn't express any suicidal thoughts and is still maintaining social relationships. These symptoms suggest that she is experiencing a complicated grief or bereavement reaction, also known as Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder. This condition typically occurs following the loss of a loved one and is characterized by intense longing for the deceased, preoccupation with the deceased, and difficulty accepting the death, in addition to symptoms like those this patient is experiencing.
","Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder



",N,"The patient has been experiencing sadness, sleep disturbances, and weight loss, which are common symptoms of depression. Moreover, these symptoms have been occurring since a significant life event, the death of her husband, which can trigger an episode of major depressive disorder. However, it's important to note that she is maintaining her social connections and does not have suicidal ideation, both good signs in terms of her mental health prognosis. It's also significant that the timeline of her symptoms is about a month which is less than the 2 months usually associated with Persistent Complex Bereavement Disorder. Hence, she most likely has an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, as this condition typically emerges within three months of a significant life event and tends to resolve within six months when the stressor or its consequences have ended.
","Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood



",N,"The prior probability of major depressive disorder (MDD) in the general population is about 7%. However, the patient's recent bereavement, coupled with persistent sadness and sleep disturbances, increase the posterior probability of MDD to about 20%. The loss of weight and crying spells further raise this probability to 40%. Moreover, her report of hearing her deceased husband's voice could suggest severe depression with psychotic features, but without other signs of psychosis, this is more likely related to her grieving process and the profound sense of loss she's experiencing. Her lack of suicidal ideation, strong social connections, and involvement in community activities suggest resilience and coping mechanisms that are more characteristic of an adjustment disorder with depressed mood than major depressive disorder. These factors would therefore decrease the probability of MDD back down to around 20%. Given her recent bereavement and the nature of her symptoms, an adjustment disorder is the most likely diagnosis.","Adjustment disorder.

Her current medications include metformin, nifedipine, and a multivitamin. She appears well. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the left mastoid process. Immediately after the patient does not hear a tone, the tuning fork is held over the left ear and she reports hearing the tuning fork again. The same test is repeated on the right side and shows the same pattern. The vibration tuning fork is then placed on the middle of the forehead and the patient hears the sound louder in the right ear. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acoustic neuroma,Otosclerosis,N,Conductive hearing loss,N,Conductive hearing loss,N,Conductive hearing loss,N,Otosclerosis,N,,"The patient is presenting with unilateral hearing loss and tinnitus. There is no obvious explanation for these symptoms in the patient's history or current medication regimen. During the Rinne test, where a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process and then in front of the ear, the patient was unable to hear the tone through bone conduction but could hear it through air conduction. This suggests that her cochlea (the part of the ear involved in air conduction) is functioning properly. The Weber test, where the tuning fork is placed in the middle of the forehead, was lateralized to the right, meaning that it was heard louder in the right ear. This pattern of results suggests sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs when there is damage to the inner ear or nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain.
","Sensorineural hearing loss



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes sensorineural hearing loss, conductive hearing loss, Meniere's disease, and otosclerosis. The patient's presentation of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss are common in both sensorineural hearing loss and Meniere's disease. However, the tuning fork tests suggest that sound is not being conducted through the bone (as evidenced by the negative Rinne test - the test where the tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process then near the ear) but is being better transmitted through air in the left ear. This is suggestive of a conductive hearing loss. Moreover, the Weber test (tuning fork on the forehead) lateralizes to the right, indicating that the left ear has the hearing loss (in conductive hearing loss, sound is perceived as quieter in the affected ear). Given the combination of symptoms and the results of the tuning fork tests, the most likely diagnosis is conductive hearing loss in the left ear.
","Conductive hearing loss



",N,"The patient has a 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear, indicating some kind of auditory impairment. The tuning fork tests performed are variations of Rinne and Weber tests, which help to differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. In this patient, the Rinne test showed that air conduction (AC) was better than bone conduction (BC) in both ears, which is normal (AC > BC). However, the Weber test showed lateralization to the right ear, suggesting either left-sided sensorineural hearing loss or right-sided conductive hearing loss. Considering the patient's symptoms (progressive hearing loss and tinnitus) and absence of any physical abnormalities that might suggest conductive hearing loss (like a blockage or physical damage), the most likely diagnosis is left-sided sensorineural hearing loss.
","Left-sided sensorineural hearing loss.



",Y,"This patient's 6-month history of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss in the left ear is suggestive of sensorineural hearing loss, which involves the inner ear, cochlea, or auditory nerve. This suspicion is confirmed by the use of the Rinne and Weber tests. The Rinne test, which compares air conduction (tuning fork is held near the ear) to bone conduction (tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process), shows normal findings on both sides as air conduction is better than bone conduction. However, the Weber test (tuning fork placed in the middle of the forehead) shows lateralization to the right ear, indicating either sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear or conductive hearing loss in the right ear. Given the absence of symptoms in the right ear, we can conclude that this patient likely has sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear.
",Left Sensorineural Hearing Loss.,Y,"The prior probability of conductive hearing loss is 30%, given the symptoms of tinnitus and progressive hearing loss. However, the fact that the patient hears the tuning fork again when it is held over the ear after not hearing it on the mastoid process, a test known as Rinne's test, suggests the presence of conductive hearing loss, increasing the posterior probability to 60%. This pattern of Rinne's test is consistent with conductive hearing loss because the test compares air conduction (holding the fork near the ear) to bone conduction (holding the fork on the mastoid process) and in conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air conduction. The Weber's test, in which the vibrating tuning fork is placed on the middle of the forehead, showing lateralization to the right ear, further increases the probability of left-sided conductive hearing loss to 80%, as in conductive hearing loss, sound is typically louder in the affected ear when using the Weber's test. Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is left-sided conductive hearing loss.

"A 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of 2 episodes of bleeding from the rectum over the past month. The patient’s father died of colon cancer at the age of 42. The patient has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. He does not smoke. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a small hard mass over the right mandible that is nontender and fixed to the underlying bone. A similarly hard and painless 5 × 5 mass is palpated over the rectus abdominis muscle. On examination of the rectum, a polypoid mass is palpated at fingertip. Proctosigmoidoscopy shows numerous polyps. What best explains these findings?",Gardner s syndrome,Familial adenomatous polyposis,Y,Familial adenomatous polyposis,Y,Familial adenomatous polyposis.,Y,Familial adenomatous polyposis,Y,Familial adenomatous polyposis,Y,,"This patient is presenting with multiple signs that suggest a hereditary condition that affects the colon and other areas of the body. He has a family history of colon cancer (his father died of the disease at a young age), and he is experiencing rectal bleeding and polyps. Furthermore, he has a hard mass over the mandible and the rectus abdominis muscle, which could be a desmoid tumor. These tumors are not malignant but can cause significant morbidity due to their locally invasive growth. All these findings point to Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), specifically Gardner's Syndrome variant, which is a subtype of FAP associated with extracolonic manifestations such as desmoid tumors, osteomas (which may explain the mandible mass), and other skin and soft tissue tumors. FAP is a genetic condition characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum from a young age, which, without prophylactic colectomy, almost invariably lead to colorectal cancer.
","Gardner's Syndrome



",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner syndrome, Lynch syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The patient's family history of early-onset colon cancer raises suspicion of a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome. The presence of numerous polyps as found on proctosigmoidoscopy makes FAP and Gardner syndrome more likely. The identification of desmoid tumors, which are characteristic of Gardner syndrome (the masses over the mandible and the rectus abdominis muscle), further narrows down the diagnosis. These are typically benign fibrous neoplasms that can arise in the context of FAP, but when associated with osteomas and epidermoid cysts, the condition is called Gardner syndrome. Therefore, Gardner syndrome is the most likely diagnosis given this patient's presentation.
","Gardner Syndrome



",Y,"The key elements to consider in this case are the patient's personal history of rectal bleeding, discovery of multiple polyps in his rectum on examination, and the family history of colon cancer at an early age. In addition to these, the presence of hard, fixed masses over the mandible and the abdomen suggest benign or malignant tumors in these locations. Given the age of the patient and his symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP is an autosomal dominant disorder that leads to the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum from a young age, with a nearly 100% risk of progressing to colorectal cancer by age 40 if not treated. Extracolonic manifestations of FAP may include osteomas (as may be seen in the mandible in this case), desmoid tumors (which may correspond to the abdominal mass), and other benign and malignant tumors.
","Familial Adenomatous Polyposis



",Y,"The findings in this patient are highly suggestive of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a condition characterized by the presence of hundreds to thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum from a young age. It is a autosomal dominant condition, and it is particularly suspected given his father's early death from colon cancer, as FAP significantly increases the risk for colorectal cancer. Moreover, this patient exhibits extracolonic manifestations like desmoid tumors (mass over the rectus abdominis muscle), and mandibular osteomas (mass over the right mandible) which are consistent with Gardner's syndrome, a variant of FAP. Therefore, a mutation in the APC gene, which is the causative factor for FAP, is the likely explanation for these findings.
","Familial adenomatous polyposis



",Y,"The prior probability of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in the general population is quite low, likely under 1% due to the rare nature of the disease. However, the patient's father died of colon cancer at an early age (42 years), which raises the probability of a hereditary condition to perhaps 15%. The presence of numerous polyps on proctosigmoidoscopy increases the posterior probability of FAP dramatically, possibly to 80%. The presence of a hard mass over the right mandible and over the rectus abdominis muscle may be indicative of desmoid tumors, which are associated with FAP, potentially increasing the likelihood of FAP to approximately 95%. Given these features, the patient likely has Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.

"A 25-year-old woman is brought to a psychiatrist’s office by her husband who states that he is worried about her recent behavior, as it has become more violent. The patient’s husband states that his family drove across the country to visit them and that his wife ‘threatened his parents with a knife’ at dinner last night. Police had to be called to calm her down. He states that she has been acting ‘really crazy’ for the last 9 months, and the initial behavior that caused him alarm was her admission that his deceased sister was talking to her through a decorative piece of ceramic art in the living room. Initially, he thought she was joking, but soon realized her complaints of ‘hearing ghosts’ talking to her throughout the house were persisting and ‘getting worse’. There was also a 4-week period where she experienced insomnia and an unintentional weight loss of 12 pounds. She seemed sad throughout these episodes, and, according to her husband, was complaining of feeling ‘worthless’. Her general hygiene has also suffered from her recent lack of motivation and she insists that the ‘ghosts’ are asking her to kill as many people as she can so they won’t be alone in the house. Her husband is extremely concerned that she may harm herself or someone else. He states that she currently does not take any medications or illicit drugs as far as he knows. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient herself does not make eye contact or want to speak to the psychiatrist, allowing her husband to speak on her behalf.

The husband's account indicates that she has been experiencing auditory hallucinations (hearing voices from inanimate objects), demonstrated violent behavior, displayed periods of depression (feelings of worthlessness, insomnia, weight loss), and significantly decreased motivation leading to neglect of personal hygiene. Furthermore, she also has delusions of harm or killing which can be threatening to herself and others around her. These symptoms collectively suggest a severe mental disorder. The duration of symptoms and the combination of hallucinations, delusions, depression, and neglect of personal hygiene are characteristic of schizophrenia, which often presents in early adulthood.
","Schizophrenia



",N,"The differential for this patient includes: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, brief psychotic disorder, and substance-induced psychotic disorder.

Step 1: In this case, the presence of hallucinations, specifically auditory hallucinations where the patient is hearing ""ghosts"" talk to her, along with violent behavior and possible delusions about needing to ""kill as many people as she can"" point toward a psychotic disorder.

Step 2: Among psychotic disorders, the prolonged duration of symptoms (9 months as per the husband's account) rules out brief psychotic disorder which typically lasts less than a month.

Step 3: The absence of any history of substance use or medications rules out a substance-induced psychotic disorder.

Step 4: The husband's description of the patient's symptoms also includes periods of insomnia, unintentional weight loss, and feelings of worthlessness, which are depressive symptoms. However, for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, there should be a period of time when there is a major mood episode concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia, and these mood episodes should be present for the majority of the total duration of the illness. Since it's unclear if these symptoms persisted in the presence of psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms, we cannot definitively diagnose schizoaffective disorder.

Step 5: Similarly, bipolar disorder with psychotic features is a possibility, but there is no mention of manic or hypomanic symptoms such as elevated mood, increased energy, grandiosity, or decreased need for sleep.

Step 6: Therefore, the remaining most likely diagnoses are schizophrenia or major depressive disorder with psychotic features. The latter is typically diagnosed when a person has experienced an episode of major depression and also has symptoms of psychosis that are exclusively confined to this depressive episode. However, the lack of motivation and deterioration in personal hygiene could be signs of negative symptoms of schizophrenia, not merely depressive symptoms.

So, given the persistent presence of psychotic symptoms over 9 months, the associated negative symptoms and no clear history of exclusively depressive episodes with psychotic features, the most likely diagnosis in this case would be schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia,N,"This patient has several key symptoms that point to a particular diagnosis.

Additionally, she's exhibited signs of severe depressive episodes, including feeling worthless, weight loss, and insomnia. Moreover, these symptoms have persisted for over 9 months, and they're impacting her ability to function, as evidenced by her poor hygiene and potential for violence. This pattern of symptoms - a mix of psychosis and depressive episodes - is indicative of schizoaffective disorder. This disorder is characterized by periods of severe symptoms of schizophrenia (like delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech or behavior) combined with symptoms of a mood disorder (like mania or depression).

The lack of drug or alcohol use as per her husband's report helps rule out substance-induced psychosis. While depressive symptoms are also present (insomnia, weight loss, feelings of worthlessness), the presence of auditory hallucinations and delusions points more towards a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, specifically paranoid subtype, rather than a major depressive disorder with psychotic features, which usually presents with mood-congruent hallucinations and delusions. Therefore, her symptoms seem to be best accounted for by a diagnosis of Schizophrenia.
","Schizophrenia



",N,"The prior probability of Schizophrenia in a general population is around 1%. However, the fact that this patient has been experiencing symptoms for 9 months increases the likelihood of this diagnosis because Schizophrenia is typically characterized by symptoms that last for 6 months or more, which increases the posterior probability to around 20%. The presence of hallucinations (the patient hearing ""ghosts"") further increases this probability to 40%, as hallucinations are a common symptom of Schizophrenia. Furthermore, the patient's violent behavior, paranoia (believing that the ""ghosts"" are asking her to kill people), and social withdrawal (not making eye contact or speaking to the psychiatrist) all increase the probability of Schizophrenia to around 60%. The period of insomnia, weight loss, and feelings of worthlessness indicate a depressive episode, which can occur in Schizophrenia and brings the probability up to around 80%.

DLB is characterized by fluctuating cognitive symptoms with pronounced variations in attention and alertness, recurrent visual hallucinations, and spontaneous features of Parkinsonism. The visual hallucinations often precede motor symptoms. A crucial point is that the cognitive/behavioral symptoms must occur before or within one year of the Parkinsonism for the diagnosis to be made. Carbidopa/levodopa is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and may have been started for his Parkinsonian symptoms, but it can sometimes exacerbate the hallucinations and confusion.

Fever and malaise typically precede the rash, which begins as erythema and evolves into flaccid bullae that rupture easily. The increased leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are indicative of a systemic inflammatory response.

",Y,"The presentation of this child suggests a skin condition known as Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS). SSSS is a condition primarily seen in children under the age of 5, often those in good health, and is caused by an exfoliative toxin produced by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by widespread redness, flaccid blisters that rupture easily, and areas of erythema or moist skin following the rupture of blisters. The so-called ""positive Nikolsky sign,"" in which the upper layers of the skin slip away from the lower layers when slightly rubbed (as with a pencil eraser, as in this case), is a classic finding in SSSS. This is in addition to lethargy and poor appetite due to systemic illness, as well as fever. Laboratory studies commonly show leukocytosis (an increased white blood cell count, as seen in this patient), which is indicative of an ongoing infection.
","Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome



",Y,"Given the symptoms, we start with a prior probability of Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) at around 1% in the general population of children.

The child has blisters and redness on his neck and chest, a characteristic of SSSS, which raises the posterior probability to 20%.

The child also has a fever, which further raises the probability of SSSS to 40% as this is a common symptom associated with bacterial infections such as SSSS.

The lethargy and reduced appetite since the appearance of the rash could be due to the systemic effect of the bacterial infection, thus increasing the posterior probability of SSSS to 50%.

The key physical exam finding is the Nikolsky's sign, demonstrated by ""twirling an eraser over the trunk results in a blister."" This sign is quite characteristic of SSSS, pushing the posterior probability of SSSS up to 80%.

Additionally, the increased leukocyte count of 22,000/mm3 and an increased Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) of 60 mm/h indicate an ongoing inflammatory process, most likely due to an infection, which further increases the probability of SSSS to 90%.

The lack of coughing, wheezing, or dysuria, along with normal oropharyngeal examination and urinalysis, makes other differential diagnoses less likely.

Considering all these factors, the posterior probability that the child has Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS) is high.","Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome

"A 23-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for knee pain. The pain started yesterday and has not improved since then. The patient is generally in good health. She attends college and plays soccer for her school's team. Three days ago, she was slide tackled during a game and her leg was struck from the outside. She fell to the ground and sat out for the rest of the game. It was not until yesterday that she noticed swelling in her knee. She also feels as if her knee is unstable and does not feel confident bearing weight on her leg during athletic activities. Her past medical history is notable for asthma, which is currently treated with an albuterol inhaler. On physical exam, you note bruising over her leg, knee, and lateral thigh, and edema of her knee. Passive range of motion of the knee is notable only for minor clicking and catching of the joint. The patient's gait appears normal, though the patient states that her injured knee does not feel stable. Further physical exam is performed and imaging is ordered. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Medial meniscal tear,Knee ligament sprain,N,Ligamentous injury,N,Knee sprain,N,Ligamentous injury,N,ACL tear,N,,"This patient's knee pain, instability, and swelling began after a sports-related injury where her knee was hit from the outside. This mechanism of injury suggests a ligamentous injury. The fact that she feels her knee is unstable suggests that one of the cruciate ligaments may be involved. However, an injury to the medial collateral ligament or lateral collateral ligament could also produce instability. In the setting of a contact injury where the leg is struck from the outside, the injury commonly involves the medial collateral ligament, the medial meniscus, and the anterior cruciate ligament, a pattern known as the ""unhappy triad"" or ""terrible triad"". This is a common injury in sports where the knee is hit from the outside while the foot is planted, like soccer. Since her range of motion is only minorly affected and she has instability, this would make a ligamentous injury more likely than a meniscal tear, which would usually present with more mechanical symptoms like locking or significant catching. While imaging would help to confirm the diagnosis, based on the history and physical exam, an injury to her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is most likely.
","Anterior cruciate ligament injury



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: meniscus tear, ACL tear, MCL tear, LCL tear, PCL tear, patellar dislocation, or a bone fracture.

The mechanism of injury (being slide tackled and struck from the outside) is more indicative of a lateral ligament injury. The medial collateral ligament (MCL) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are usually injured with valgus (inward) stress. She reported instability, which is often felt in ligament injuries but less common in meniscal tears. However, the edema, the ""clicking"" sensation, and instability might also suggest a meniscal tear.

The Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL) is typically injured from a direct force on the inside of the knee (medial side) while the foot is planted, which matches her description of the incident. Also, her feeling of instability can be attributed to an LCL tear as the LCL helps to prevent unnecessary side-to-side motion of the knee joint.

In the absence of acute severe pain, significant deformity, or inability to bear weight, a bone fracture is less likely.

A conclusive diagnosis should be made after imaging studies (such as an MRI), but the most probable diagnosis considering the history of trauma, instability, and the mechanism of injury is a tear of the Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL).","Lateral Collateral Ligament (LCL) Tear



",N,"This patient has experienced a knee injury during a soccer game with symptoms of knee instability, swelling, and a sense of ""clicking"" and ""catching"" within the joint. These findings are highly suggestive of an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), which plays a key role in maintaining the stability of the knee joint. ACL injuries commonly occur during activities involving sudden stops and changes in direction - movements typical in soccer. The mechanism of injury (a blow to the outside of the knee) also fits with an ACL injury, which can be caused by sudden, significant force applied to the knee. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is an anterior cruciate ligament injury.
","Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury



",N,"The patient's knee injury was incurred during a game of soccer when her leg was struck from the outside, causing her to fall. This mechanism of injury is consistent with an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), one of the key ligaments that help stabilize the knee joint. Symptoms such as knee swelling, instability, and a lack of confidence in bearing weight on the leg are also characteristic of an ACL tear. A sensation of ""clicking"" or ""catching"" in the joint during motion may indicate that a piece of the torn ligament or possibly a piece of damaged cartilage is interfering with the normal movement of the joint. As the gait appears normal, it suggests a partial ACL tear rather than a complete tear.
","Partial anterior cruciate ligament tear.



",N,"The prior probability of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is about 3% in the general population. However, this patient is a college soccer player, which increases the posterior probability to about 10%.

The reported feeling of knee instability, a common symptom of ACL injury, raises the probability to 50%. In addition, the finding of a clicking and catching sensation during the range of motion of the knee, which is also associated with ACL injury, increases the probability to about 70%. Considering all these factors, this patient most likely has an ACL injury.","ACL injury

The benign physical examination also makes polycystic kidney disease less likely. The patient has papillary necrosis and tubulointerstitial infiltrate on renal biopsy, which is characteristic of analgesic nephropathy.

What is the best explanation for this patient’s electrolyte abnormalities?",Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia,Primary hyperparathyroidism,N,Dehydration.,N,Renal tubular acidosis,N,Drug use,N,Hyperparathyroidism,N,,"The patient's laboratory values show an elevated calcium level (hypercalcemia) and an elevated PTH (Parathyroid Hormone) level. The primary cause of hypercalcemia is usually hyperparathyroidism. In primary hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, which in turn leads to an increase in blood calcium levels by promoting the release of calcium from bones, increasing calcium absorption in the gut, and reducing renal calcium excretion. However, a frequent cause of hypercalcemia that should be considered in this patient with a significant smoking history is malignancy, and specifically, lung cancer, which can cause paraneoplastic secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) leading to hypercalcemia. Although the PTH level would usually be suppressed in malignancy-related hypercalcemia, in some cases PTH and PTHrP may be difficult to distinguish in lab tests, leading to an elevated PTH measurement. Furthermore, her back stiffness and pain could suggest metastatic disease to the bone which could also lead to increased calcium release into the bloodstream.
","Lung cancer (paraneoplastic hypercalcemia)



",N,"The differential for this patient's electrolyte abnormalities, specifically the elevated calcium (Ca2+: 12.2 mEq/L) and parathyroid hormone (PTH: 75 pg/mL), includes primary hyperparathyroidism, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), and malignancy-related hypercalcemia.

Given the patient's smoking history and chronic alcohol consumption, malignancy-related hypercalcemia, particularly from lung cancer, could be a consideration. However, malignancy-associated hypercalcemia typically suppresses PTH, which is not the case here.

FHH, a genetic disorder, is characterized by lifelong elevated serum calcium levels with relatively normal PTH. However, in FHH, the urinary calcium excretion is usually low, which does not align with the patient's report of ""low"" urine calcium.

Primary hyperparathyroidism, commonly caused by a parathyroid adenoma, is characterized by high calcium and inappropriately normal or high PTH. Even though this patient does not present with specific symptoms of hypercalcemia (e.g., kidney stones, bone pain, abdominal pain, psychiatric disturbances - remembered by the mnemonic ""stones, bones, moans, and psychiatric overtones""), the lab findings are quite consistent with this diagnosis. It's worth noting that many cases of primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or present with vague symptoms, such as the back pain this patient reports.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's electrolyte abnormalities is primary hyperparathyroidism.","Primary Hyperparathyroidism



",N,"This patient presents with hypercalcemia (serum calcium 12.2 mg/dL), as indicated by her elevated serum calcium levels and high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Given her heavy smoking history, this hypercalcemia could be attributed to the paraneoplastic syndrome associated with lung cancer, where the tumor produces and releases PTH-related peptide that acts like PTH, leading to increased serum calcium levels. The paraneoplastic syndrome caused by lung cancer would also explain why her PTH levels are elevated despite the high levels of calcium (which normally should inhibit PTH release). Furthermore, her chronic alcohol use could contribute to this condition, as it is associated with bone loss, potentially leading to release of stored calcium into the bloodstream.
","Paraneoplastic syndrome due to lung cancer



",N,"This patient's elevated serum calcium (hypercalcemia) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, which is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of PTH, usually because of an adenoma in one of the parathyroid glands. In normal conditions, PTH helps regulate serum calcium levels by increasing bone resorption, kidney reabsorption of calcium, and activation of vitamin D to increase intestinal absorption of calcium. However, in primary hyperparathyroidism, the overproduction of PTH leads to persistently high serum calcium levels. While this patient is consuming alcohol, salmon, and vitamin D, none of these directly increase PTH or serum calcium levels to the degree seen in this patient. Chronic high alcohol intake can cause hypercalcemia, but it's typically associated with hypoparathyroidism and would be unlikely to elevate PTH. Similarly, high vitamin D levels can lead to increased calcium absorption and thus hypercalcemia, but again this wouldn't cause an elevated PTH.
","Primary Hyperparathyroidism



",N,"The prior probability of hypercalcemia due to parathyroid pathology in the general population is low. In this case, the patient's serum calcium level is high (12.2 mg/dL) and the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is also elevated (75 pg/mL), suggesting that primary hyperparathyroidism is likely, which increases our posterior probability.

Furthermore, her urine calcium is low. In primary hyperparathyroidism, we often expect high levels of calcium in urine due to increased bone resorption and renal reabsorption, but low levels might be present in cases where the kidneys are able to compensate. This doesn't change our posterior probability much, but it does add another piece to the puzzle.

There are no significant findings in the patient's history or other lab results that would suggest malignancy, another common cause of hypercalcemia, thus decreasing the probability of this cause.

The benzodiazepine presence in urine could be from self-medication to manage back pain or stress, it doesn't necessarily tie into the electrolyte abnormalities but it's another facet of the patient's health that needs addressing.

No mention of symptoms like depression, fatigue, constipation, or polydipsia/polyuria which could point towards hypercalcemia but the lack of these symptoms does not exclude the possibility.

So, given the lab results, especially the elevated Ca2+ and PTH levels, the most probable explanation for the patient's electrolyte abnormalities is primary hyperparathyroidism, despite the low urinary Ca2+.","Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Given his age and the clinical presentation, the most likely causative organism would be Streptococcus pneumoniae (also known as pneumococcus). S. pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults. This conclusion is based on the knowledge of common pathogens causing meningitis across different age groups.
","Streptococcus pneumoniae



",Y,"The patient presents with fever, chills, severe headache, altered responsiveness and neck rigidity, which collectively suggest a diagnosis of meningitis. Meningitis in adults can be caused by several organisms, among which Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Haemophilus influenzae are the most common.

In determining the most likely organism, it is helpful to consider the age of the patient and his medical history.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired meningitis in adults. Neisseria meningitidis is more common in younger individuals and those living in close quarters, such as military barracks or college dormitories.

Listeria monocytogenes is typically a concern in elderly patients, those with impaired cell-mediated immunity, pregnant women, or patients with alcoholism. Our patient is elderly, and his type 2 diabetes might impair his cell-mediated immunity, thus making Listeria a possible concern.

Haemophilus influenzae used to be a major cause of bacterial meningitis, but widespread vaccination has significantly reduced its prevalence.

In this case, the patient's age, poorly controlled diabetes, and severe presentation make Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes the most likely pathogens. However, since the patient has received all recommended childhood vaccines (which would typically include the pneumococcal vaccine), and considering his poorly controlled diabetes (a factor that increases the risk of Listeria infection), Listeria monocytogenes seems to be the most probable causal organism.","Listeria monocytogenes.

Given his age, the most common bacterial causes of meningitis are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Listeria monocytogenes. However, considering the fact that he has a history of type 2 diabetes, which makes him immunocompromised, Listeria monocytogenes becomes a more significant consideration. While Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common overall cause of bacterial meningitis in adults, Listeria monocytogenes is a common cause of meningitis in patients who are immunocompromised, including those with diabetes, and is therefore the most likely causative organism in this patient.

",N,"The patient's symptoms including fever, chills, severe headache, altered mental status, and particularly neck rigidity, are highly suggestive of bacterial meningitis. As this patient is above the age of 50 and has poorly controlled diabetes, he is in the age group where Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes are most likely to cause meningitis. However, S. pneumoniae is more common, even in this age group, especially given that the patient has received all recommended childhood vaccines (which would include pneumococcal vaccine). It's important to note that despite vaccination, some individuals may still develop disease due to the numerous serotypes of S. pneumoniae.

The fact that the patient had a heart condition as a child treated with antibiotics and the presence of crackles at both lung bases suggest a cardiovascular issue rather than a primary pulmonary disease. The childhood heart condition treated with antibiotics suggests possible rheumatic fever, which could have resulted in chronic valvular damage - typically mitral or aortic valves. If the damage was significant, the patient could have developed heart failure over time. The symptoms of shortness of breath, nocturnal cough, and even hemoptysis (bloody cough), along with bilateral lung crackles, are typical of congestive heart failure, which is often a result of longstanding heart disease such as valvular disease.

Mitral stenosis leads to left atrial pressure increase, which in turn can lead to pulmonary congestion (causing crackles at lung bases and symptoms such as shortness of breath and hemoptysis). If untreated, this can eventually lead to pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure.
","Mitral Stenosis



",Y,"The prior probability of a condition related to his childhood heart condition is significant. Given that he was treated with antibiotics, it might suggest a bacterial infection such as Rheumatic Fever, which can lead to Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD).

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, nocturnal cough, and bloody cough increase the posterior probability of a cardiac condition, potentially congestive heart failure secondary to the valve damage caused by RHD. Additionally, the presence of crackles at both lung bases in the pulmonary examination suggests fluid buildup, often seen in heart failure.

Without more specific details about the cardiac examination and potential echocardiogram findings, we cannot precisely estimate the posterior probabilities, but these symptoms and signs are consistent with a valvular heart disease secondary to a childhood rheumatic fever, leading to congestive heart failure.","Congestive Heart Failure.

These symptoms suggest she might have bipolar disorder, and her recent change in behavior could be attributed to the initiation of an antidepressant medication. Antidepressants can precipitate manic episodes in individuals with bipolar disorder, especially if they are not being treated with a mood stabilizer.
","Antidepressants



",Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes stimulant intoxication, manic episode of bipolar disorder, or the effects of an antidepressant medication. Given the information provided, a stimulant intoxication seems less likely as there's no direct information about illicit drug use. A spontaneous manic episode of bipolar disorder could occur, but given the recent treatment initiation for her low energy and depressed mood, it is more likely that she was started on an antidepressant medication. Antidepressant medications, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are known to induce mania or hypomania in individuals with underlying bipolar disorder who have not been previously diagnosed. Given her recent history of depressive symptoms and the sudden change to a high-energy state with pressured speech, decreased need for sleep, and grandiose delusions, this presentation is consistent with a medication-induced manic episode.
","Antidepressant medication.



",Y,"The sudden shift from a low energy, depressive state to an agitated state with high energy, decreased need for sleep, increased goal-directed activity, pressured speech, and grandiosity in this patient suggests a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, currently in a manic episode. Given that her symptoms occurred shortly after a visit to the student health clinic for depressive symptoms, it's likely that she was started on an antidepressant, which can precipitate a switch into mania or hypomania in individuals with bipolar disorder.
",Antidepressants,Y,"This patient's symptoms of decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, hyperactivity, and grandiosity are characteristic of a manic episode, which can be seen in bipolar disorder. This is a dramatic change from her recent symptoms of low energy and depressed mood. Given the recent onset, it's likely that her manic symptoms are a side effect of treatment for depression. Certain antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), can precipitate manic episodes in individuals with undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Thus, the medication most likely to have precipitated this patient's event is an antidepressant.
","Antidepressants



",Y,"The prior probability that this individual has bipolar disorder, given the history of low energy and depressed mood followed by a period of heightened activity, irritability, and reduced need for sleep, is fairly high. However, the specific question is which medication could have precipitated these symptoms. Without knowing the exact medication started one week ago for her depressive symptoms, we can infer from the context that it might be an antidepressant.

Antidepressants have a known risk of triggering a manic or hypomanic episode in individuals with bipolar disorder. This occurs in approximately 10-15% of individuals with bipolar disorder treated with antidepressants. Given that this patient had recent depressive symptoms and the onset of her symptoms is consistent with the typical delay in onset of action for antidepressants (about 1-2 weeks), the probability that an antidepressant is responsible increases significantly, perhaps to around 90%. Therefore, the most likely medication to have precipitated this patient's event is an antidepressant.","Antidepressants

The patient also has tenderness upon palpation at the right upper quadrant which could be suggestive of residual inflammation or an abscess, but this is also less likely than surgical site infection given the erythema and discharge at the incision site. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a surgical site infection.
","Surgical site infection.



",Y,"The patient's recent surgery and symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, erythema, and discharge from the abdominal incision site suggest a wound infection post-surgery. Wound infections usually appear a few days post-surgery and are often characterized by warmth, erythema, and discharge from the surgical site. This is distinguished from other postoperative complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (which might be suggested by her recent long drive), by the localized signs of infection at the surgery site.
","Wound infection



",Y,"Given that this patient recently underwent a cholecystectomy and now presents with a fever, erythema, and purulent discharge from the surgical site, the most probable cause of her fever is a surgical site infection (SSI). This condition is a common complication post-surgery and is characterized by local inflammation (erythema, warmth), purulent drainage, and often systemic signs of infection such as fever. Moreover, her prolonged car travel, which could have delayed her seeking care, may have exacerbated the situation. Other potential causes of fever in the postoperative period could include pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, but the local signs of infection make a surgical site infection the most likely.
","Surgical site infection



",Y,"In this Bayesian inference, we start with the prior probabilities of several conditions that might cause fever in this context: postoperative infection (say, a prior probability of 10%), deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism (given the recent surgery and long drive, assume a prior probability of 5%), gallstone remaining in the bile duct (a prior probability of 2%), and some sort of non-surgical related illness such as flu or pneumonia (prior probability of 1%).

Her symptoms include fever and abdominal pain, but more telling is the erythema and white discharge from the surgical site. These are indicative of an infection, specifically postoperative infection, which would significantly increase the posterior probability of this diagnosis, say to 60%.

The long drive post-surgery might increase the chances of a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, but without symptoms such as leg pain/swelling or chest pain/breathlessness, this posterior probability might only increase slightly, to perhaps 7%.

A remaining gallstone in the bile duct would usually cause symptoms such as jaundice, which she does not display. Therefore, the posterior probability for this might stay around the same, at 2%.

Lastly, a non-surgical related illness could always be a possibility, but without respiratory symptoms, the posterior probability for this might also stay the same, at 1%.

Given all these considerations, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with a postoperative infection.","Postoperative infection.

She has hypertension, chronic bilateral knee pain, and a history of breast cancer 15 years ago that was treated with lumpectomy. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Medications include hydrochlorothiazide and acetaminophen. She appears well. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation of the lower spine. Both knees are enlarged and swollen. Neurologic examination shows sensorineural hearing impairment of the left ear. Her gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is 30 U/L (N: 0–30 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is 310 U/L, and serum calcium is 10.2 mg/dL. A spinal x-ray shows a fracture in the L4 vertebra.

She has a history of breast cancer, which is significant because breast cancer can metastasize to bone, and she has evidence of a fracture in the L4 vertebra on spinal x-ray. Her blood tests show an elevated alkaline phosphatase, which is a common finding in conditions involving bone, including metastases. She also has sensorineural hearing loss which can be unrelated. However, her history of breast cancer, sudden onset of back pain, and vertebral fracture are highly suggestive of metastatic breast cancer to the bone.
","Metastatic breast cancer.



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes osteoporosis, metastatic cancer (given her history of breast cancer), rheumatoid arthritis, or Paget's disease of bone. The presence of a vertebral fracture suggests osteoporosis or metastatic disease. The enlarged and swollen knees may suggest rheumatoid arthritis or Paget's disease. However, the finding of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and normal gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) and calcium levels point toward a bone origin of the ALP, rather than a liver origin. This would be consistent with Paget's disease, which is associated with elevated ALP due to increased osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. The hearing impairment could be due to involvement of the skull base in Paget's disease, which can cause conductive or sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Paget's disease of bone.
",Paget's disease of bone.,Y,"This patient has a history of breast cancer, and now presents with a new, sudden-onset back pain associated with a finding of vertebral fracture on imaging. While age-related osteoporosis could certainly contribute to this, her past cancer history raises suspicion for metastatic disease, particularly as breast cancer is known to commonly metastasize to bone. Furthermore, the elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is often associated with bone turnover and can be increased in cases of bone metastases. The sudden onset of the back pain after a trivial event and her normal calcium levels help rule out osteoporotic fracture and hyperparathyroidism respectively. Thus, it is more likely that this patient has bone metastases from her previous breast cancer.
","Bone metastases from breast cancer



",N,"The patient's history is quite informative here. She has a sudden onset of back pain and a previous history of breast cancer, and the radiography reveals a fracture in the L4 vertebra. It's important to note that breast cancer is one of the malignancies that commonly metastasize to bone. The presentation of sudden back pain and a vertebral fracture in this context is concerning for a pathological fracture secondary to metastatic cancer. Additionally, the elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is consistent with increased bone turnover, which could be due to bone metastasis. It is also important to note that postmenopausal women are at a higher risk for osteoporosis, but the sudden onset and the history of breast cancer make metastasis more likely.
","Bone metastasis.



",N,"The prior probability of metastatic disease in the spine might be considered low in the general population, but this individual has a history of breast cancer, which significantly raises the prior probability. Let's say this increases the prior probability to 15%. The presence of sudden back pain, especially in the context of known malignancy, further increases the probability of metastatic disease to perhaps 40%. The tenderness on palpation of the spine, coupled with a clear radiographic abnormality - a fracture in the L4 vertebra - increases the posterior probability further, to around 70%. Additionally, the elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), often seen in bone disease including metastases, further supports the likelihood of metastatic disease, possibly bringing the probability to around 85%. Even though she had breast cancer 15 years ago, and no mention is made of recent mammograms or other surveillance, in the context of her new back pain, spinal tenderness, abnormal spinal X-ray, and elevated ALP, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic disease in the spine.

It commonly presents with a vesicular rash in the distribution of the affected nerve (here, right forehead and tip of the nose) and can cause vision impairment.

HZO is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) within the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The vesicular rash on the forehead and tip of the nose is associated with Hutchinson's sign, which strongly suggests the involvement of the eye in a herpes zoster infection.

","Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus.



",Y,"This patient presents with a headache, malaise, fever, and right-sided blurry vision and eye pain. The erythematous and tender eyelid, along with vesicles over the right forehead and tip of the nose, suggest a varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection, also known as shingles. VZV is a herpesvirus that remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia and can reactivate, particularly in times of stress or immunosuppression, causing shingles. In this case, the location of the lesions in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (forehead and tip of the nose) implies herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The reduced corneal sensitivity and tree-like pattern on fluorescein staining of the cornea further support the diagnosis. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus can cause vision loss and should be treated urgently. This patient's immunocompromised state, due to her Crohn's disease and treatment with prednisone, likely contributed to the reactivation of VZV.
","Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus



",Y,"The prior probability of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) is relatively low in the general population. However, the presence of multiple vesicles over the right forehead and the tip of the nose, which follows a dermatome, substantially increases this probability. This is because HZO is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, which innervates these areas, and it typically presents with a vesicular rash in this distribution. Therefore, the posterior probability of HZO after noting the vesicular rash might rise to around 40%.

Adding in the symptom of right-sided blurry vision and eye pain further increases this probability, as these are common symptoms of HZO. Therefore, the posterior probability after noting these symptoms might rise to around 60%.

Furthermore, the presence of conjunctival injection and reduced corneal sensitivity in the right eye adds to the likelihood of HZO, as these are typical features of this condition. After noting these signs, the probability of HZO might rise to around 80%.

Finally, the tree-like pattern on fluorescein staining, which is characteristic of the dendritic ulcers caused by HZO, makes this diagnosis extremely likely. After taking into account this finding, the posterior probability of HZO might be around 95%.

Additionally, the use of prednisone, an immunosuppressant, in this patient could increase the likelihood of viral infections such as HZO. Given the patient's constellation of symptoms and clinical signs, a diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus is highly probable."," Herpes zoster ophthalmicus

The patient is a hunter and often goes shooting in his spare time. His recent sick contacts include his grandson who is being treated with amoxicillin for ear pain. Physical exam is notable for decreased hearing bilaterally. The Weber test does not localize to either ear, and the Rinne test demonstrates air conduction is louder than bone conduction.

This is suggestive of a sensorineural hearing loss, which means that there is a problem with the nerves or sensory organs responsible for hearing. Given his age and history of regular exposure to loud noises due to his hunting hobby, it's most likely that his hearing loss is due to age-related changes and noise-induced hearing loss.
","Noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.



",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: age-related hearing loss (presbycusis), noise-induced hearing loss, ototoxicity from medications, and conductive hearing loss from ear infection or ear wax impaction.

This patient's recent sick contact with his grandson who had ear pain could suggest an infectious cause; however, he himself is not reporting any pain, fevers, or other signs of infection. Additionally, given his grandson is being treated with amoxicillin, the probability of a resistant infection being passed on is low.

Considering the patient's history of frequent hunting and shooting, noise-induced hearing loss should be considered. However, noise-induced hearing loss typically presents as sensorineural hearing loss, where bone conduction is better than or equal to air conduction on the Rinne test, which is not the case in this patient.

The patient's recent diagnosis of bladder cancer raises the possibility of ototoxicity from chemotherapy medications. However, ototoxic medications usually result in sensorineural hearing loss, not conductive hearing loss, which is suggested by the Rinne test result in this patient.

Presbycusis or age-related hearing loss is a common cause of hearing loss in the elderly, and usually presents as a bilateral symmetric sensorineural hearing loss, again not consistent with the Rinne test result.

Given the physical exam findings of a Rinne test demonstrating air conduction louder than bone conduction, the most likely diagnosis is conductive hearing loss. This could be caused by ear wax impaction or middle ear effusion, among other causes. The Rinne test result is characteristic of conductive hearing loss, as it shows that air conduction (through the external ear structures) is better than bone conduction (through the internal ear structures), which is not the normal result.",Conductive hearing loss.,N,"This patient has noticed a decline in hearing that is bilateral and the Weber test does not localize, suggesting a symmetric loss. The Rinne test demonstrates that air conduction is louder than bone conduction, which is normal and suggests a sensorineural hearing loss. Given the patient's history of frequent shooting, noise-induced hearing loss is the most likely cause. This type of hearing loss results from chronic exposure to loud noises, such as gunshots, which can damage the hair cells in the cochlea that transmit sound to the brain.
","Noise-induced hearing loss



",N,"The patient's history of hunting and shooting suggests exposure to loud noise, which can cause sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss, characterized by decreased hearing acuity that doesn't localize to one ear on the Weber test and air conduction being better than bone conduction on the Rinne test, is indicative of inner ear or auditory nerve damage. This type of hearing loss can result from prolonged exposure to loud noises, leading to damage of the hair cells in the cochlea. The gradual onset of the hearing loss, as well as the patient's age, make sudden sensorineural hearing loss or an infectious cause less likely. Thus, the most likely cause of his hearing loss is noise-induced hearing loss.
","Noise-induced hearing loss.



",N,"The prior probability of sensorineural hearing loss is 40% given the patient's age. The patient has a history of regular shooting, which is associated with acoustic trauma and noise-induced hearing loss, increasing the probability of sensorineural hearing loss to 65%. The Weber test, which did not localize, and the Rinne test, which demonstrated that air conduction was louder than bone conduction, are both indicative of sensorineural hearing loss, further increasing the probability to 85%. The patient has recent sick contact with a person with an ear infection, but since he does not have symptoms of infection, this does not significantly change the probability. Therefore, given this Bayesian analysis, the patient's hearing loss is most likely due to sensorineural hearing loss, potentially exacerbated by his frequent exposure to loud noise from shooting.

Depression is less likely because while the patient has some symptoms of depression (insomnia, sexual dysfunction), other common symptoms like anhedonia or feelings of guilt are not mentioned. Alcohol and nicotine withdrawal are also less likely as the symptoms started two weeks after his hospital discharge, not immediately, and we don't have information suggesting he stopped alcohol or cigarette consumption. Trazodone, while it can cause sexual dysfunction, is less likely to cause headaches and is actually used to aid sleep, so it wouldn't typically cause sleep disturbance.

Given his recent traumatic experience and new-onset of these symptoms, it's plausible to consider adjustment disorder. Adjustment disorder is a stress-related, short-term, non-psychotic disturbance. Symptoms could include depressed mood, anxiety, disturbance of conduct (manifested as socially inappropriate behavior), or all of these. They usually occur within three months of the stressful event (in this case, the car accident and subsequent hospital stay).
","Adjustment disorder



",N,"This patient's reported symptoms of erectile dysfunction, headaches, and trouble sleeping could be related to several factors. Given his recent traumatic experience and hospitalization, it's quite possible that he is suffering from a stress or anxiety-related condition. The headaches and sleep disturbances further support a diagnosis related to psychological stress. Additionally, he has risk factors for atherosclerosis (smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) which could be affecting his sexual function. However, the sudden onset after a traumatic event is more suggestive of a psychological cause. The use of trazodone for sleep could also be affecting his sexual function as trazodone has been associated with priapism and other sexual side effects. However, it's important to rule out physiological causes, but given the sudden onset and the context, a psychogenic erectile dysfunction seems most likely.

",N,"This patient's presentation strongly suggests he's experiencing erectile dysfunction (ED), potentially due to a combination of physical and psychological factors. The probability of ED as a diagnosis starts at 10% (given his age and comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension that increase the risk for ED). Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption further exacerbate the risk, increasing the likelihood to 30%.

The recent traumatic event, specifically the head-on collision, might have caused not only physical but also psychological trauma, which might have further raised the probability to 50%. The fact that he's been unable to engage in sexual activities since the accident could be a sign of stress or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), taking the likelihood up to 65%.

The new onset of minor headaches and sleep problems are common symptoms associated with stress or anxiety disorders, which are known to cause or exacerbate ED, raising the probability to 80%. The use of certain medications like trazodone can also contribute to ED, pushing the likelihood to around 90%.

The elevated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels along with the low albumin level, increased prothrombin time (PT), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) also support liver dysfunction. The hepatitis serologies indicate past infection (or vaccination) with Hepatitis A and immunity to Hepatitis B, but no current infection with hepatitis A, B, or C.

The fact that she recently traveled to Belize is also relevant. This area has a high incidence of Hepatitis E, which can cause acute liver disease and is particularly severe in pregnant women, especially in the third trimester.

The hepatitis E virus is primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route, such as through contaminated water, which she may have been exposed to during her recent travel.

Her liver enzyme levels are elevated suggesting some sort of hepatocellular injury. Her yellowish discoloration of the sclera and increased total bilirubin indicate jaundice, which is a sign of liver disease. The confusion, low glucose level, and flapping tremor suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which typically occurs in the setting of acute or chronic liver failure. The prothrombin time (PT) is increased indicating a decrease in liver synthetic function. The symptoms are sudden which makes chronic liver disease less likely. The absence of hypertension and proteinuria makes HELLP syndrome less likely. She doesn't have itching, making cholestasis of pregnancy less likely.

The flapping tremor (asterixis) is indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver failure and consequent inability to detoxify the blood, leading to an accumulation of toxins that affect the brain.

The fact that she is in the third trimester of her pregnancy and has a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, makes conditions specific to pregnancy more likely. The elevated bilirubin, elevated transaminases, and coagulopathy are consistent with acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), a rare but serious liver disorder that happens in the third trimester or early postpartum period. This condition is typically accompanied by symptoms like malaise, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, as seen in this patient.

Her past medical history of preeclampsia is also a risk factor for AFLP. Although she traveled to Belize four months ago, her hepatitis A and C tests are negative, which makes viral hepatitis less likely.","Acute fatty liver of pregnancy



",Y,"The patient presents with signs of liver failure (yellowish discoloration of the sclera, ascites indicated by abdominal distention, hepatic encephalopathy indicated by confusion and flapping tremor), along with laboratory evidence of liver injury (high bilirubin, high aminotransferases), and coagulopathy (prolonged PT and PTT).

We first assign a prior probability for acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) which is rare, so let's assume it's about 1%. AFLP often presents with signs of liver failure, increasing the posterior probability to, say, 10%. She is in the third trimester of pregnancy, a common time for AFLP to occur, so the probability increases to, say, 30%. She also has nausea and vomiting, common in AFLP, so the probability goes up to 40%. She has evidence of hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, flapping tremor), further increasing the probability to 50%. Her laboratory findings of liver injury and coagulopathy are also consistent with AFLP, increasing the probability to 60%. Given her clinical presentation and laboratory findings, acute fatty liver of pregnancy is the most likely diagnosis.","Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy

"A 74-year-old right-handed woman was referred to the hospital due to concerns of a stroke. In the emergency department, the initial vital signs included blood pressure of 159/98 mm Hg, heart rate of 88/min, and respiratory rate of 20/min. She exhibited paucity of speech and apathy to her condition, although she complied with her physical examination. The initial neurologic evaluation included the following results:

Right-sided gaze deviation with full range of motion with doll’s head maneuver
No facial asymmetry
Grossly intact hearing

3+ left hip and thigh
2+ left leg and foot
A head computed tomography (CT) scan and a head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed areas of ischemia. Which artery is the most likely site of occlusion?",Right anterior cerebral artery,Right middle cerebral artery,N,Right middle cerebral artery,N,Middle cerebral artery.,N,Right middle cerebral artery,N,Right middle cerebral artery,N,,"This patient's symptoms include right-sided gaze deviation and decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, along with decreased strength in the left hip, thigh, leg, and foot. She also presents with ischemic changes on neuroimaging. The clinical manifestations suggest an issue with the left hemisphere of the brain, as it controls the right field of gaze and the right side of the body.

The fact that she also has muscle weakness in her left lower extremities indicates an issue with the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for voluntary motor control. In the brain, the corticospinal tract originates from the motor cortex.

The distribution of sensory and motor symptoms indicates a lesion in a part of the brain supplied by the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The MCA is one of the three major paired arteries that supply blood to the cerebrum and it primarily supplies the lateral convexity of the hemisphere, which includes the primary motor and sensory areas for the face and upper extremities as well as areas controlling gaze. Hence, an occlusion in the left MCA could cause these symptoms.","Middle cerebral artery



",N,"The patient's symptoms include a right-sided gaze deviation and decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, which indicates a left-sided brain lesion due to the contralateral control of the brain. Also, there is weakness in the left lower extremity, which again points to a lesion on the right side of the brain. More specifically, these signs and symptoms point to an area called the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory, as it supplies the frontal eye field (which would cause gaze deviation when affected) and parts of the sensory and motor cortices, which could explain the sensory deficit and muscle weakness. Therefore, the most likely site of occlusion is the left middle cerebral artery.
","Left Middle Cerebral Artery



",N,"The patient is presenting with right-sided gaze preference, decreased sensation to light touch on the right leg, and significant weakness in the left leg. This suggests a unilateral lesion in the left hemisphere of the brain, affecting the frontal eye field (hence the right-sided gaze preference) and the motor and sensory areas corresponding to the lower limb. Such a presentation is typically seen with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke, but the sparing of the upper limb and face in this case points towards the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The ACA primarily supplies the medial and superior parts of the brain, including the leg-foot area of the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, which would correlate with her left-sided lower extremity weakness and sensory loss.
","Anterior cerebral artery



",Y,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of a stroke involving the left anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The anterior cerebral artery supplies blood to most medial and superior parts of the frontal lobes and superior medial part of the parietal lobes. Occlusion of the ACA often results in contralateral lower extremity weakness and sensory loss, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of decreased sensation in the right leg and weakness in the left leg and foot. The patient also demonstrates signs of cognitive and behavioral changes (paucity of speech and apathy), which can result from frontal lobe involvement (the frontal lobes are responsible for aspects of cognition and behavior).
","Anterior cerebral artery.



",Y,"In assessing a possible stroke, it's important to connect the signs and symptoms to the vascular territories in the brain. This patient's signs and symptoms are suggestive of a stroke that has affected her left lower extremity more than her right, in addition to a right-sided gaze deviation. The neurologic findings suggest an issue predominantly on the left side of the brain, as the brain controls the opposite side of the body and gaze direction.

The prior probability of a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion is the highest, given that it's the most common site of cerebrovascular accidents. However, given the symptoms, this doesn't fit the typical MCA syndrome, which usually involves the upper extremities and face more than the lower extremities, and could also involve language dysfunction if it occurs in the dominant hemisphere.

Anterior cerebral artery (ACA) strokes classically present with more severe motor and sensory deficits in the contralateral lower extremity than the upper extremity, as observed in this patient. Additionally, the presence of right-sided gaze deviation may indicate a frontal eye field involvement, which is supplied by the ACA.

By using Bayesian inference, we start with a certain probability for each type of stroke, then modify this probability based on the patient's symptoms. Here, the symptoms significantly increase the probability of the ACA being the site of occlusion.","Anterior Cerebral Artery.

",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include cholecystitis, appendicitis, pyelonephritis, preeclampsia with severe features, or HELLP syndrome. However, her symptoms of upper abdominal pain, pyuria, and leukocytosis are suggestive of an infection. Considering her gestational age and the location of her pain, conditions such as preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome would be less likely as they are usually associated with other symptoms like hypertension, proteinuria, or signs of liver damage, which are not presented in this case. Appendicitis usually presents with lower right quadrant pain, which she does not have. The upper right quadrant pain might suggest gallbladder disease such as cholecystitis, but this would usually not cause a fever or leukocytosis unless complicated by an infection. Considering her symptoms and physical examination findings, she most likely has pyelonephritis, a kidney infection that can cause upper abdominal pain, fever, and pyuria.
",Pyelonephritis.,N,"This pregnant woman presents with upper abdominal pain, fever, and mild pyuria (white blood cells in the urine). While pyuria can be a sign of urinary tract infection, her symptoms of pain localizing to the right upper quadrant suggest a more likely diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Pregnancy is a risk factor for gallbladder disease, including cholecystitis, due to hormonal effects causing gallbladder hypomotility and an increase in lithogenic bile. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, often accompanied by fever and leukocytosis as seen in this patient. While the pain of cholecystitis can sometimes be referred to the right shoulder, the lack of this symptom doesn't rule it out.

",N,"The patient's presentation of progressive upper abdominal pain, particularly in the right upper quadrant, combined with a fever and leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), suggests an acute inflammatory process. Her urinalysis showing mild pyuria (pus in the urine) could point towards urinary tract infection, but given the location of her pain, it is more likely to be associated with a gallbladder issue. Gallstones are more common during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that slow gallbladder contractions and increase cholesterol levels in bile. Furthermore, gallstones can lead to acute cholecystitis if a stone obstructs the cystic duct. This could explain her localized right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis.

A high leukocyte count is suggestive of infection, further increasing the likelihood to 30%. The presence of right upper quadrant tenderness, which is associated with gallbladder disease, raises the posterior probability to around 50%.

"A 70-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an 8-week history of blood in his stool. Two months ago, he had an episode of bronchitis and was treated with amoxicillin. Since then, he has noticed blood in his stool and on the toilet paper occasionally. The patient has had intermittent constipation for the past 5 years. Six months ago, he had severe left lower quadrant pain and fever that resolved with antibiotic therapy. He underwent a colonoscopy 3 years ago, which did not show any evidence of malignancy. He takes levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. He had smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years, but quit smoking 10 years ago. He drinks one glass of red wine every night. He appears pale. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 98 kg (216 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg.

Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. Laboratory studies show:

What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Diverticulosis,Colorectal cancer,N,Colorectal cancer,N,Colorectal cancer,N,Colorectal cancer,N,Anemia,N,,"The patient in question is a 70-year-old male who has a history of blood in his stool for 8 weeks. The patient has a history of smoking and alcohol consumption, although these habits have been discontinued for some time. His history also includes an episode of bronchitis and severe left lower quadrant pain and fever, both of which were treated with antibiotics.

The most relevant finding in his examination is the paleness of his conjunctiva and positive test for occult blood in his stool. These findings, combined with his low hemoglobin level, indicate that he is anemic. The type of anemia is suggested by his mean corpuscular volume (MCV) which is low (76 μm3, normal range is 80-96 μm3), indicating a microcytic anemia. In combination with the red cell distribution width (RDW) which is elevated (17% when the normal range is 13-15%), this points towards an anemia of chronic disease (also known as anemia of inflammation) or iron deficiency anemia.

However, iron deficiency anemia is typically associated with gastrointestinal blood loss in men and post-menopausal women. This man has noticed blood in his stool and on the toilet paper occasionally, which also points towards iron deficiency anemia.

Therefore, considering the patient's age, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and history of visible and occult gastrointestinal bleeding, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia, likely secondary to a gastrointestinal source of blood loss (which could be due to several reasons such as a malignancy, angiodysplasia, hemorrhoids, etc).","Iron Deficiency Anemia



",N,"The differential for this patient includes diverticular disease, gastrointestinal malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, angiodysplasia, hemorrhoids, and inflammatory bowel disease. He had an episode of severe left lower quadrant pain and fever 6 months ago which resolved with antibiotic therapy, suggesting diverticulitis. Now, he is presenting with blood in his stool, occasional constipation, and laboratory evidence of iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia with high red cell distribution width). His symptoms of constipation and bleeding, his history of diverticulitis, and his positive fecal occult blood test are consistent with diverticular bleeding. While gastrointestinal malignancy is a concern for any patient with blood in the stool, his recent colonoscopy (3 years ago) did not show any evidence of malignancy. Diverticular disease is the most common cause of lower GI bleeding in adults over 40, particularly in those with a history of diverticulitis, like this patient.
","Diverticular bleeding



",Y,"This patient presents with signs of chronic blood loss as shown by the pale conjunctivae, positive stool for occult blood, and a low hemoglobin value indicating anemia. His low Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) suggests microcytic anemia which is often due to iron deficiency anemia, typically caused by chronic blood loss. His Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is high, which is often seen in iron deficiency anemia as the body tries to produce new red blood cells of varying sizes in response to a low iron supply. Given his history of occasional blood in the stool, it seems probable that the patient has been losing blood chronically from the gastrointestinal tract. The history of severe left lower quadrant pain and fever six months ago that resolved with antibiotic therapy suggests that he might have had diverticulitis. Diverticulosis (which can cause diverticulitis) is a common cause of painless rectal bleeding in older adults and can result in iron deficiency anemia due to chronic blood loss.
","Diverticulosis-associated bleeding.



",Y,"The patient presents with an 8-week history of blood in his stool, pale appearance, and pale conjunctivae, indicative of chronic blood loss. The blood tests reveal a low hemoglobin level, suggesting anemia, and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is decreased (76 �m3, normal is 80-100), pointing to microcytic anemia. The red cell distribution width (RDW) is increased, indicating variation in red blood cell size (anisocytosis), which is often seen in iron deficiency anemia. His history of occasional constipation and episode of severe left lower quadrant pain and fever that resolved with antibiotics is suggestive of diverticular disease. Diverticula, especially in the sigmoid colon, are common in older individuals and can cause intermittent, painless, rectal bleeding leading to iron deficiency anemia. This patient's colonoscopy 3 years ago did not show any malignancy, making colorectal cancer less likely. Therefore, this patient most likely has bleeding diverticular disease resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
","Bleeding diverticular disease.

However, the lack of previous seizure history, rhythmic movements, resistance to opening her eyes, and muttering during the episode are atypical for seizures. These findings are more characteristic of a psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES), often seen in the context of psychological distress or psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PNES episodes are not associated with abnormal electrical discharges in the brain like epileptic seizures and often have atypical features such as the ones present in this patient.

",Y,"The differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with convulsions includes epileptic seizures, non-epileptic seizures (such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, or PNES), metabolic disturbances, and toxic ingestion among others. However, the patient's recent traumatic experience (sexual assault) and the description of her convulsions are suggestive of a non-epileptic seizure. This is further supported by the fact that she has no past history of seizures, and her physical examination suggests resistance to eye opening, which is often seen in PNES. In addition, her convulsions are described as arrhythmic and thrashing around, which is more typical of PNES than epileptic seizures, which usually have a rhythmic pattern.
","Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.



",Y,"The presentation of this patient with the sudden onset of convulsions in the context of recent intense emotional stress, with the absence of a history of seizures, suggests a diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). Also known as pseudoseizures, these events are psychological (not epileptic) in origin. They can often resemble epileptic seizures but there are some key differences, such as the resistance to eye-opening, the asynchronous movement of limbs, and the fact that they can often last longer than typical epileptic seizures. It's important to note that PNES are not faked or voluntary; they represent a physical manifestation of psychological distress.
","Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures



",Y,"The patient's presentation is most suggestive of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), also known as pseudoseizures. While real seizures are caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain, pseudoseizures are a psychological response to severe stress, trauma, or emotional distress. They're often seen in patients with a history of mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but can also occur after acute traumatic events. In this case, the patient's recent sexual assault and resultant emotional distress may have triggered the pseudoseizures. Furthermore, key signs that suggest pseudoseizures over true seizures include the lack of a postictal phase (a period of confusion or drowsiness after a seizure), resistance to eye-opening, and arrhythmic, or non-stereotyped movements.
","Pseudoseizures



",Y,"The prior probability of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES), also known as pseudoseizures, is relatively low in the general population, let's say around 1%. However, the fact that the patient has no prior history of seizures, coupled with her being in a severely emotional state after a traumatic event, would significantly increase the probability of PNES, let's say to around 30%. Additionally, her physical symptoms�arrhythmic thrashing, closed eyes with resistance to opening them�are consistent with PNES rather than an epileptic seizure, raising the likelihood even further, possibly to around 60%.

Finally, the lack of a postictal phase (a period of confusion or disorientation that typically follows an epileptic seizure) also suggests PNES, and might increase our confidence to above 70% or even 80%. So, taking all these factors together, PNES or pseudoseizures is the most likely diagnosis in this patient.","Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures

The failed insertion of a nasogastric tube and the presence of an anterior ectopic anus suggest anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract. These signs combined with the fact that the pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios, a condition that often arises due to issues with swallowing amniotic fluid in utero, all point to a diagnosis of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula, a condition in which the esophagus does not properly connect with the stomach and there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea.",Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula,Y,"Without the actual image of the chest and abdomen x-ray, it's a bit challenging to provide a concrete diagnosis. However, based on the provided clinical features such as cyanosis, foaming and drooling at the mouth, bilateral crackles at the lung bases, systolic murmur, and anterior ectopic anus, the differential diagnosis can be narrowed down to the following: esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), congenital heart disease, respiratory distress syndrome, or sepsis.

Esophageal atresia with TEF is strongly suggested by the inability to pass a nasogastric tube, drooling, choking, and the presence of polyhydramnios in the mother. Cyanosis can occur due to aspiration and respiratory distress. The ectopic anus is another congenital anomaly that supports a diagnosis of a congenital condition like esophageal atresia with TEF, as it's known that these conditions can occur with other congenital abnormalities.

Congenital heart disease might present with a heart murmur and cyanosis, but it does not explain the drooling, choking, or the inability to pass a nasogastric tube.

Respiratory distress syndrome could explain the cyanosis and respiratory distress, but again it does not account for the other gastrointestinal symptoms.

Sepsis could theoretically cause some of these symptoms, but it would be less likely in a newborn without a clear source of infection and the symptoms onset is quite fast for sepsis.

In conclusion, based on the given clinical scenario, the most likely diagnosis is esophageal atresia, possibly with a tracheoesophageal fistula.",Esophageal Atresia with TEF.,Y,"The newborn's symptoms of cyanosis, drooling, and foaming at the mouth shortly after birth, along with the physical finding of an anterior ectopic anus and the inability to pass a nasogastric tube, suggest the presence of esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula. The harsh systolic murmur could indicate a concurrent congenital heart defect, which is often seen in association with this condition. In addition, the pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios, which can occur due to the baby's inability to swallow and absorb amniotic fluid in the presence of esophageal atresia.",Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula.,Y,"The baby presents with cyanosis, foaming, and drooling at the mouth, and bilateral crackles in the lungs. These symptoms suggest difficulties with swallowing and potential aspiration, hence the crackles heard in the lungs. Polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) in the mother's pregnancy is a clue as it often implies fetal swallowing issues, given that fetal swallowing is one mechanism by which amniotic fluid is normally decreased. The inability to successfully insert a nasogastric tube and the presence of an anterior ectopic anus suggests an anatomic anomaly. These symptoms strongly suggest an esophageal atresia with a distal tracheoesophageal fistula, which is a congenital condition where the esophagus terminates before it reaches the stomach, and instead forms a connection with the trachea. This allows gastric content to be aspirated into the lungs, causing the respiratory distress and crackles, and prevents normal swallowing, explaining the drooling and foaming at the mouth.",Esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula,Y,"Without the image referred to in the question, it's not possible to provide a specific Bayesian inference. However, considering the clinical findings of cyanosis, drooling, and attempted but perhaps unsuccessful nasogastric tube insertion, as well as the congenital anomaly of an anterior ectopic anus, the prior probability of esophageal atresia (with or without tracheoesophageal fistula) is approximately 1 in 3500 live births.

The drooling and foaming at the mouth could indicate problems with swallowing and can increase the posterior probability to about 10%.
The failure to pass a nasogastric tube (assuming from the information given) could increase the probability to about 30%.
The presence of an additional congenital anomaly, the anterior ectopic anus, can increase the probability to about 50%, given that these conditions can occur together as part of the VACTERL association (Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheo-Esophageal fistula, Renal anomalies, and Limb abnormalities).
The mention of polyhydramnios during pregnancy increases the posterior probability further as it is often seen with esophageal atresia due to the inability of the fetus to swallow and absorb amniotic fluid, hence increasing its volume. This can increase the probability to around 70%.
Lastly, the bilateral crackles heard at the lung bases could be due to aspiration secondary to the esophageal atresia, increasing the probability to about 90%.",Esophageal atresia,N

Furthermore, the mother admitted to smoking during pregnancy, which has been associated with a higher risk of various problems including hypoglycemia in infants. Hypoglycemia could explain most, if not all, of the symptoms described here. The child's elevated hematocrit (70%) may be secondary to polycythemia, a common response to chronic intrauterine hypoxia, such as that caused by maternal smoking. Polycythemia can result in hyperviscosity, which can lead to symptoms like facial plethora and pale extremities. The hypoglycemia and polycythemia are therefore likely linked, with the smoking during pregnancy being the root cause.",Maternal smoking during pregnancy,Y,"The differential for this newborn includes conditions such as neonatal sepsis, congenital heart disease, respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal hypoglycemia, and polycythemia. The baby's symptoms including vomiting, jitteriness, and poor feeding are suggestive of neonatal hypoglycemia, particularly given the reported serum glucose level of 38 mg/dL, which is below the generally accepted lower limit of normal for a neonatal blood glucose level (>45 mg/dL).

The mother's history of smoking during pregnancy is also pertinent, as this is a known risk factor for many neonatal problems including neonatal hypoglycemia. This is due to the fact that maternal smoking can impair placental function, leading to a reduced nutrient supply for the fetus, which can then lead to low glucose levels at birth.

The baby's elevated heart rate (171/min) and increased respiratory rate (60/min) could be a response to the hypoglycemia, as these are common symptoms of the body's sympathetic response to low blood sugar. The pale extremities and facial plethora may suggest polycythemia, which is a common finding in babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy. Polycythemia itself could cause hypoglycemia due to increased cellular glucose consumption. However, the hematocrit, while high, is not above the generally accepted threshold for neonatal polycythemia (>65%).

Given the baby's low blood glucose, history, and clinical picture, the most likely cause of these findings is neonatal hypoglycemia.",Neonatal hypoglycemia,N,"The infant presents with hypoglycemia (serum glucose 38 mg/dL), jitteriness, vomiting, and feeding difficulty. These are signs of neonatal hypoglycemia. The fact that the mother smoked during pregnancy is also significant, as smoking is associated with a decreased nutrient supply to the fetus, leading to intrauterine growth restriction and subsequent neonatal hypoglycemia. The high hematocrit of 70% could be due to polycythemia, which is sometimes associated with intrauterine growth restriction. Hence, this patient's symptoms are most likely due to neonatal hypoglycemia.",Neonatal hypoglycemia,N,"This newborn presents with hypoglycemia (serum glucose 38 mg/dL), jitteriness, poor feeding, and a high hematocrit value (70%). These symptoms are consistent with polycythemia, which can occur due to intrauterine hypoxia. The mother's smoking habit could have induced chronic fetal hypoxia, leading to an upregulation of erythropoiesis as a compensatory mechanism. This results in an elevated hematocrit, or polycythemia. Polycythemia can cause hypoglycemia due to increased glucose utilization by the excessive red blood cells. It can also result in hyperviscosity, which may explain the sluggish capillary refill and pale extremities due to reduced blood flow. Therefore, the most likely cause of this newborn's symptoms is polycythemia secondary to maternal smoking.",Polycythemia,Y,"The prior probability of polycythemia in newborns is roughly 5%. The baby presents with a hematocrit level of 70%, which is significantly higher than the typical range (45-60%) for newborns. This information raises the posterior probability of polycythemia to 50%. The baby is also presenting with hypoglycemia (serum glucose 38 mg/dL), which is a common finding in infants with polycythemia and increases the probability to 70%. The infant has a history of maternal smoking during pregnancy, a well-known risk factor for neonatal polycythemia, which further increases the probability to 85%. Jitteriness and inadequate feeding, signs of neurologic irritability, are also manifestations of polycythemia and hypoglycemia, which supports our previous assumptions and thus increases the likelihood to 95%. The infant's presentation, including the high hematocrit level, signs of hypoglycemia, and the history of maternal smoking, makes neonatal polycythemia the most likely diagnosis.",Neonatal Polycythemia,Y
"A 23-year-old male presents to his primary care physician after an injury during a rugby game. The patient states that he was tackled and ever since then has had pain in his knee. The patient has tried NSAIDs and ice to no avail. The patient has no past medical history and is currently taking a multivitamin, fish oil, and a whey protein supplement. On physical exam you note a knee that is heavily bruised. It is painful for the patient to bear weight on the knee, and passive motion of the knee elicits some pain. There is laxity at the knee to varus stress. The patient is wondering when he can return to athletics. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lateral collateral ligament tear,MCL sprain,N,ACL tear,N,Knee sprain,N,Ligament tear,N,ACL tear,N,,"The patient experienced a trauma to the knee during a sports game, and there is now pain, bruising, and laxity with varus stress. Varus stress tests the integrity of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). If this test is positive, it suggests that the LCL might be damaged. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a lateral collateral ligament injury.",Lateral collateral ligament injury.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes ligamentous injuries such as medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury, lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injury, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. Meniscal injuries or bone fractures could also be possible. Given the history of trauma from a rugby game and the laxity to varus stress, we can likely rule out ACL and PCL injuries, as these typically present with a positive drawer sign or Lachman test, not varus stress. Varus stress primarily impacts the LCL, making LCL injury more likely. Injuries to the MCL would present with laxity in response to valgus stress, not varus stress. Meniscal injuries typically present with pain during twisting or squatting movements, which isn't described here. Fractures might present with severe pain, inability to bear weight, and obvious deformity - none of which is described here. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a lateral collateral ligament injury.",Lateral collateral ligament injury.,Y,"The patient's presentation of a knee injury with persistent pain despite the use of NSAIDs and ice, along with an inability to bear weight, suggests a serious injury to the knee. The finding of laxity on varus stress indicates an injury to the structures that resist this force, which are primarily the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). Other structures, like the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), could also be injured, but these would typically present with different signs on physical examination (anterior or posterior drawer sign, respectively). Given this information, the most likely diagnosis is a lateral collateral ligament injury.",Lateral Collateral Ligament Injury,Y,"The patient's symptoms and history of trauma suggest a knee ligament injury. The knee's stability is maintained by several ligaments, including the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and lateral collateral ligament (LCL). The patient's symptom of pain with passive motion and especially the finding of knee laxity with varus stress specifically points to injury of the LCL. Varus stress tests the integrity of the LCL, and positive findings (i.e., increased laxity compared to the uninjured side) would be suggestive of an LCL injury.",Lateral collateral ligament injury,Y,"The prior probability of an injury to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) given knee pain in a young athlete is about 5%. The presence of knee pain after a trauma (such as a tackle in rugby) increases the posterior probability of an LCL injury to 10%. The failure of conservative measures like NSAIDs and ice, along with the inability to bear weight, further increases the probability of an LCL injury to 20%. The presence of pain with passive motion of the knee could be consistent with a variety of knee injuries, increasing the probability of an LCL injury to 30%. However, the definitive symptom here is the knee laxity with varus stress, which is a classic finding of an LCL injury, increasing the probability to 90%. Thus, this patient likely has a lateral collateral ligament injury.",Lateral collateral ligament injury,Y

This is most common in children and is not related to his history of obstructive sleep apnea.",Night terrors,Y,"The differential diagnosis for a child presenting with sudden nocturnal awakening, screaming, crying, and aggressive kicking includes: night terrors, nightmares, seizure disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea exacerbation. Given that the boy goes back to sleep when the episodes are over and has no recall of the events, this points towards night terrors rather than nightmares, which are usually remembered. Seizure disorders would typically present with other neurological signs or symptoms.

The laboratory results indicate leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count), indicative of an ongoing infection. In the urine, there are both red and white blood cells, and leukocyte esterase is positive. These findings, combined with the patient's symptoms, strongly suggest an infection of the urinary tract that has spread to the kidney, also known as pyelonephritis. Other causes of right flank pain like appendicitis, ovarian torsion, and kidney stones are less likely given the laboratory findings and clinical presentation.",Pyelonephritis,Y,"The differential for this patient includes gastrointestinal infection (such as from eating contaminated egg salad), pelvic inflammatory disease (given her sexual history and inconsistent condom use), and urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis (evidenced by right flank pain and urinalysis results).

The patient does not exhibit gastrointestinal symptoms aside from vomiting, which could also be attributed to severe pain, so a gastrointestinal infection is less likely. Pelvic examination does not show any abnormalities, which makes pelvic inflammatory disease less probable.

The right flank pain, fever, chills, and vomiting could all be symptoms of a kidney infection or pyelonephritis, particularly when considered with the results of the urinalysis. The urinalysis shows the presence of blood, protein, leukocyte esterase, and white blood cells, all indicative of a urinary tract infection, but the severe pain and systemic symptoms suggest this has likely progressed to pyelonephritis.",Pyelonephritis,Y,"This patient presents with fever, chills, right flank pain, and vomiting. The leukocytosis and presence of blood, protein, and white blood cells in the urine are indicative of an infection in the urinary tract. Flank pain suggests that this infection may have ascended to involve the kidney, a condition known as pyelonephritis. Although gastrointestinal upset (due to ingestion of spoiled egg salad) could potentially cause similar symptoms, the presence of white blood cells and blood in the urine is more consistent with a urinary tract infection than gastroenteritis. Furthermore, her inconsistent condom use could increase her risk for urinary tract infections due to the potential transmission of bacteria. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute pyelonephritis.",Acute pyelonephritis,Y,"The patient presents with fever, chills, and right flank pain. The laboratory studies show an elevated leukocyte count indicative of an ongoing infection. Furthermore, the urine test results indicate the presence of leukocyte esterase and high numbers of white blood cells (WBCs), both signs of urinary tract infection (UTI). Additionally, the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) and protein in the urine could suggest inflammation or damage in the upper urinary tract. The right flank pain could be indicative of a kidney involvement, especially pyelonephritis. All these symptoms and signs suggest that the patient has a kidney infection, or pyelonephritis, most likely originating from a lower UTI.",Pyelonephritis,Y,"The prior probability of Pyelonephritis is around 15%. Given the patient's symptoms, such as flank pain and fever, the probability of Pyelonephritis increases to about 35%. Considering her recent food consumption at a barbecue, it could suggest the possibility of food poisoning, but this typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, which she does not report, therefore this does not significantly increase the probability of a foodborne illness.

The presence of leukocyte esterase in her urine, a marker for the presence of white blood cells (WBCs) which suggests inflammation or infection in the urinary tract, increases the probability of Pyelonephritis to about 65%. The high number of WBCs in her urine further increases the probability to about 90%. The negative nitrites result in her urine is not common for a urinary tract infection (UTI) as nitrites are typically present when bacteria that cause UTIs convert nitrates to nitrites. However, this is not a definitive rule, as some types of bacteria do not produce nitrites and a UTI may still be present.

Given these considerations, and the absence of other more likely diagnoses, the most likely diagnosis is Pyelonephritis.",Pyelonephritis,Y
"A 62-year-old woman is seen in the hospital for neutropenic fever. She was admitted 1 week ago for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Due to her chemotherapy, she became pancytopenic.

The transfusion was stopped, intravenous fluids were started, and blood cultures were drawn. The patient also complained of chest pain and shortness of breath. A chest radiograph was obtained and was normal. This morning, she reports “dark urine” but denies dysuria or abnormal vaginal discharge. Her prophylactic antimicrobials started at the time of her chemotherapy include acyclovir, levofloxacin, and fluconazole.

On physical examination, she has 1+ pitting peripheral edema of bilateral lower extremities to the mid-shin. Her jugular venous pressure is 6 cm. Her labs show neutropenia, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactose dehydrogenase, elevated total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin.

She is on prophylactic antivirals, antibiotics, and antifungals because of her chemotherapy. The patient also has mild edema in her lower legs and her jugular venous pressure is within normal limits. Her labs show that she is neutropenic (low white blood cell count), has normocytic anemia (normal-sized red blood cells, but too few of them), is thrombocytopenic (low platelet count), has elevated lactate dehydrogenase and total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin levels. Coagulation studies show increased bleeding time but normal D-dimer levels. These findings are suggestive of intravascular hemolysis, which can occur in transfusion reactions. A key feature of this condition is the presence of dark urine due to hemoglobinuria, which is consistent with the patient's complaint.

The patient's history of dark urine, fever, hypotension during transfusion, and the presence of anemia with elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin is indicative of intravascular hemolysis seen in hemolytic transfusion reactions. Her coagulation studies show an increase in bleeding time with normal D-dimer levels, which would be inconsistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (which would generally show elevated D-dimer levels) but are compatible with a hemolytic transfusion reaction. This patient most likely had a hemolytic transfusion reaction.",Hemolytic transfusion reaction.,Y,"This patient is presenting with fever, chest pain, shortness of breath during blood transfusion, dark urine, and lower extremity edema after receiving packed red blood cell transfusion. These symptoms in conjunction with her laboratory findings suggestive of hemolysis (elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin) are strongly indicative of a transfusion reaction. The normal D-dimer level helps to rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The specific type of transfusion reaction, in this case, is likely Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (AHTR) due to ABO incompatibility. AHTR typically presents within minutes to hours of transfusion and can cause fever, chills, flank pain, dyspnea, and hemoglobinuria (dark urine due to free hemoglobin). Her neutropenia is likely related to her AML and chemotherapy, and her peripheral edema may be related to a decrease in oncotic pressure due to the rapid intravascular fluid shifts associated with AHTR.",Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction,Y,"The clinical scenario provided suggests the patient underwent a transfusion reaction. The combination of her symptoms including fever, hypotension, chest pain, shortness of breath during the transfusion, followed by dark urine the next day, points towards a transfusion-related acute lung injury or a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Given the dark urine and the lab findings, a hemolytic transfusion reaction is more likely. The increased lactate dehydrogenase, increased total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin are indicative of hemolysis. The body metabolizes the hemoglobin released during hemolysis into bilirubin, leading to increased bilirubin levels. Lactate dehydrogenase is released by damaged red blood cells, which also indicates hemolysis. Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin, and in conditions of significant hemolysis, its levels decrease due to consumption. Furthermore, the coagulation studies are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can be triggered by a severe hemolytic reaction.",Hemolytic transfusion reaction,Y,"The prior probability of a transfusion reaction is high given the clinical context of a recent packed red blood cell transfusion. Transfusion reactions can present with various symptoms including fever, hypotension, and chest pain, which the patient experienced during the transfusion. This increases the likelihood of a transfusion reaction to a posterior probability of around 60%. The development of ""dark urine"" could suggest hemolysis or breakdown of red blood cells, which could be a result of an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction, increasing the probability further to around 80%.

Further laboratory findings including neutropenia, normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactose dehydrogenase, elevated total bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin are consistent with intravascular hemolysis, which can occur due to a mismatched blood transfusion, increasing the posterior probability to approximately 95%. The increased bleeding time could be related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a possible complication of severe hemolytic transfusion reactions, but the normal D-dimer level makes this less likely. So, taking all the clinical context and laboratory findings together, this patient likely has had an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction.",Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction,Y

She notes that she often puts the patient to sleep on his stomach because he seems to breathe more easily in that position. The patient’s mother has noticed that the patient’s breathing becomes more “strained” when lying on his back. She cannot remember when this problem began, but she believes it has gotten worse in recent weeks. The patient was born at 40 weeks gestation and has no other past medical history. The patient’s temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 75/55 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 24/min. His oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient appears comfortable and has inspiratory stridor that improves while leaning forward. His lungs are otherwise clear to auscultation bilaterally. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s respiratory symptoms?",Laryngomalacia,Laryngomalacia,Y,Laryngomalacia,Y,Laryngomalacia,Y,Laryngomalacia,Y,Laryngomalacia,Y,,"This infant is exhibiting inspiratory stridor, a high-pitched sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway. This is often a sign of laryngomalacia, the most common cause of stridor in infants. This condition is characterized by the collapse of the supraglottic structures of the larynx during inspiration, causing the characteristic stridor. This can be worse in the supine position, as in this case, because of gravity's effects on the floppy laryngeal tissues, and it can improve when the infant is leaning forward or prone. This condition typically presents within the first few weeks of life and often worsens over the first few months, as the mother of this patient has observed.",Laryngomalacia,Y,"The differential for this patient includes laryngomalacia, croup, epiglottitis, foreign body aspiration, and tracheomalacia. Based on the patient's age, symptoms, and lack of other signs of illness, laryngomalacia seems most likely. The mother reports that the stridor has been present for some time and seems to be worsening, which is consistent with laryngomalacia that typically presents within the first few weeks to months of life and often worsens before it gets better around 12-18 months of life. The fact that the stridor improves when the patient leans forward is also consistent with laryngomalacia, where positional changes can affect the degree of the floppy larynx's obstruction. The absence of other symptoms such as fever, drooling, and signs of respiratory distress would make other causes such as croup, epiglottitis, and foreign body aspiration less likely. Thus, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is laryngomalacia.",Laryngomalacia,Y,"This patient's symptoms of positional difficulty breathing, with inspiratory stridor that improves upon leaning forward, are suggestive of a condition that obstructs the upper airways. The stridor, which is a high-pitched sound resulting from turbulent air flow in the upper airway, indicates obstruction at or above the level of the larynx. The fact that the symptoms improve when the child leans forward suggests that gravity is helping to alleviate the obstruction. Given the patient's age and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is congenital laryngomalacia. This is a condition in which the tissues of the larynx are soft and floppy, causing them to collapse and partially obstruct the airway, particularly when the child is lying on their back. The condition typically presents within the first few weeks of life and often worsens before improving spontaneously by 18-24 months of age.",Congenital laryngomalacia,Y,"This infant has inspiratory stridor that improves with positioning, suggesting a problem with the upper airway. Specifically, the description fits well with laryngomalacia, the most common cause of stridor in infants. Laryngomalacia is characterized by immature cartilage of the upper larynx that collapses inward during inspiration, leading to airway obstruction. Symptoms typically present within the first few weeks of life and can worsen over the first several months. Stridor is generally worse when the infant is supine (as in this case) and often improves with the infant leaning forward or prone.",Laryngomalacia,Y,"The prior probability of laryngomalacia in an infant presenting with noisy breathing is 20% given its prevalence as the most common cause of noisy breathing in infants. The fact that the symptoms are worse when the baby is lying on his back increases the posterior probability to 35%, because laryngomalacia is often worse in the supine position. The finding of inspiratory stridor that improves while leaning forward increases the probability to 60%, as laryngomalacia typically presents with inspiratory stridor that improves with position changes. Moreover, the stridor has gotten worse over weeks which is consistent with the natural course of laryngomalacia, increasing the probability to 80%. Given the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this infant is laryngomalacia.",Laryngomalacia,Y
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician for vaccinations and a physical. She is a generally healthy child with no thumb on her right hand and a shortened and deformed left thumb. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines and meeting all developmental milestones. On physical examination her vital signs are stable. On auscultation of the heart, the pediatrician notes a wide fixed split in the second heart sound (S2) and a medium-pitched systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. The murmur is not harsh in quality and is not accompanied by a thrill. Her echocardiogram confirms the diagnosis of acyanotic congenital heart defect with left-to-right shunt.

Given her history, she likely has a genetic disorder causing these diverse symptoms. One well-known syndrome that is associated with both thumb abnormalities and heart defects is Holt-Oram syndrome. Holt-Oram syndrome, also known as heart-hand syndrome, is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by skeletal abnormalities of the upper limbs (especially the thumbs) and cardiac defects, commonly atrial and ventricular septal defects, which cause left-to-right shunting and can manifest as a wide, fixed split of S2 and a systolic ejection murmur.",Holt-Oram syndrome,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's genetic syndrome includes Holt-Oram syndrome, Fanconi anemia, TAR syndrome (Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome), and VACTERL association.

The child's congenital thumb abnormalities, along with the congenital heart defect suggest the possibility of Holt-Oram syndrome, which is characterized by upper limb abnormalities (often affecting the thumb or radial side of the arm) and cardiac defects (like atrial or ventricular septal defects causing a left-to-right shunt, as seen in this case).

Fanconi anemia can present with thumb abnormalities but is usually associated with other hematologic abnormalities and not typically with cardiac anomalies, making it less likely.

TAR syndrome presents with a complete absence of the radius and thrombocytopenia, which doesn't match the presentation in this case.

VACTERL association includes a spectrum of defects (Vertebral defects, Anal atresia, Cardiac defects, Tracheo-Esophageal fistula, Renal anomalies, and Limb abnormalities). However, these cases usually present with more widespread abnormalities than just the thumb and heart.

Given the child's thumb abnormalities and congenital heart defect, the most likely genetic syndrome is Holt-Oram syndrome.",Holt-Oram syndrome,Y,"The findings of the thumb anomalies and a congenital heart defect, specifically an acyanotic one with left-to-right shunt (most likely an atrial septal defect, given the description of a wide fixed split in the second heart sound), suggest the presence of Holt-Oram syndrome.

Congenital heart defects associated with this syndrome often include atrial and ventricular septal defects, which can lead to a left-to-right shunt as suggested by the wide fixed split in the second heart sound and the systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border. Holt-Oram syndrome is a genetic condition, often due to mutations in the TBX5 gene.",Holt-Oram syndrome.,Y,"The prior probability of Holt-Oram syndrome, which is characterized by upper limb abnormalities and cardiac defects, is about 2% in the general population. Given the child's upper limb abnormalities (absent right thumb, deformed left thumb), the posterior probability increases to about 20%. The presence of a congenital heart defect, specifically an acyanotic defect with a left-to-right shunt, which is seen in Holt-Oram syndrome, further increases the posterior probability to about 40%. Lastly, the absence of any other systemic involvement or dysmorphic features (since Holt-Oram syndrome is usually limited to the heart and upper limbs) further increases the likelihood of Holt-Oram syndrome to about 60%. Based on these findings, the child most likely has Holt-Oram syndrome.",Holt-Oram syndrome,Y

This nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the wrist, and its function can be impaired due to a fracture in the humerus, as it spirals around the shaft of the humerus. Additionally, the location of the radial nerve makes it susceptible to injury during humeral fractures. This patient's clinical presentation and mechanism of injury suggest a humeral fracture, which has likely caused radial nerve damage.",Humeral fracture,Y,"The differential for this patient includes fractures such as clavicle fracture, humerus fracture, radius or ulna fracture, scaphoid fracture, or a fracture involving the cervical spine. However, the unique symptom of this patient is the inability to extend his wrist on the right upper extremity, indicating a motor nerve problem. The nerve most commonly responsible for wrist extension is the radial nerve. A radial nerve injury can occur due to various reasons including humerus fracture, pressure injury (like crutch palsy), or direct trauma. Given the high energy trauma of a head-on motor vehicle collision, a humerus fracture injuring the radial nerve is a highly likely consideration.",Humerus fracture,Y,"The patient has presented with an inability to extend the wrist in the right upper extremity following a traumatic motor vehicle collision. This clinical presentation is strongly suggestive of injury to the radial nerve, which is often associated with a fracture of the humerus. Radial nerve can get damaged in the ""spiral groove"" of the humerus, leading to wrist drop - the inability to extend the wrist.",Humerus fracture,Y,"This patient's inability to extend the wrist on the right side after a motor vehicle accident suggests damage to the radial nerve, which controls extension of the wrist. The radial nerve passes through the radial groove of the humerus and is prone to injury when the humerus is fractured. This is often referred to as ""Saturday night palsy"" in a non-traumatic context. The absence of other significant findings in the physical exam (i.e., bilateral breath sounds, normal S1 and S2, no signs of JVD) further supports a localized injury such as a humeral fracture as opposed to other significant chest or abdominal injuries. Therefore, a humeral fracture is most likely in this patient.",Humeral fracture,Y,"The prior probability of a humerus fracture causing the wrist drop is high, let's estimate it at 50%, given the presentation with the inability to extend the wrist (wrist drop). However, radial nerve injury is commonly associated with humerus fractures and can lead to a wrist drop. This increases the posterior probability of a humerus fracture to 70%.

The fact that the patient was involved in a high impact motor vehicle collision increases the probability of a humerus fracture further to 80%. The observation of the patient presenting with wrist drop without any other neurological deficits increases the probability to 90%.

This patient most likely has a humerus fracture, specifically, a fracture in the area of the humerus where the radial nerve runs, leading to wrist drop (radial nerve palsy).",Humerus fracture,Y

He spent time outdoors in the evenings without mosquito protection, which could put him at risk for certain diseases transmitted by mosquitos. The rash on the trunk and proximal extremities (but not involving palms or soles) along with conjunctival suffusion and joint tenderness suggest viral illness. His symptoms, the history of recent travel to Brazil, and the absence of pathogenic organisms on a peripheral blood smear make Zika virus, a mosquito-borne illness, the most likely diagnosis, especially considering the reported symptom of blood in the ejaculate, which is a known symptom of Zika virus infection.",Zika virus infection,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient with fever, malaise, joint pain, rash, hearing loss, and bloody semen includes: Zika virus, Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Malaria, and Leptospirosis. His recent travel to Brazil and exposure to mosquitoes points towards a mosquito-borne illness like Zika, Dengue or Chikungunya. However, his hearing loss and bloody semen are specific features of Zika virus infection. Dengue fever usually presents with high fever, severe headache, and retro-orbital pain, which are not mentioned in this case. Chikungunya could explain the fever and joint pain, but not the hearing loss or bloody semen. Malaria could be ruled out as no pathogenic organisms are noted in the peripheral blood smear. Leptospirosis often presents with conjunctival suffusion and can include rash and joint pain, but it does not typically cause hearing loss or hematospermia (bloody semen), and it's usually associated with water or animal exposure rather than mosquito bites.

Specifically, the combination of fever, rash, arthralgia, conjunctival suffusion, hearing impairment and the presence of blood in the ejaculate are suggestive of Zika virus infection. This virus is transmitted by the Aedes species mosquito, which is prevalent in Brazil. The lack of any pathogenic organisms in the blood smear does not rule out Zika virus, as it is primarily diagnosed through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on serum or urine, rather than through blood smear microscopy.",Zika virus infection,Y,"The patient presents with symptoms like fever, malaise, headaches, and joint pain which are typical signs of a systemic viral infection. The presence of a maculopapular rash and conjunctival suffusion further narrow the possibilities. Blood in the ejaculate and hearing impairment are also clinical features consistent with this infection. Moreover, the history of recent travel to Brazil and lack of mosquito bite prevention suggests a possible infection with a mosquito-borne virus, as Brazil is a known endemic region for several such viruses. Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Zika virus infection, which is primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito and can cause the symptoms observed in the patient, including rash, fever, joint pain, and even conjunctivitis (conjunctival suffusion). It's also important to note that Zika virus has been associated with sexual transmission, explaining the blood in the ejaculate, and there have been reports of Zika virus causing sensorineural hearing loss.",Zika virus infection,Y,"The prior probability of Zika virus is 10% given the general population.

These symptoms, combined with her Ashkenazi Jewish descent, raise suspicion for inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of right lower quadrant pain along with barium enema findings of ulceration and narrowing of the right colon points more specifically to Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract but is most commonly seen in the terminal ileum and ascending colon. Other laboratory findings consistent with Crohn's disease include anemia (as evidenced by her hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL), leukocytosis (as shown by her leukocyte count of 12,000/mm3), and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (indicative of an inflammatory response).",Crohn's disease,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and celiac disease.

Given the intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, and inability to fully empty the bowels, IBS could be a consideration. However, IBS is typically not associated with weight loss or elevated inflammatory markers, and the presence of right lower quadrant pain in this patient is also unusual for IBS.

Colorectal cancer is unlikely given the patient's age, but it could cause weight loss, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits. However, this diagnosis would not explain the elevated inflammatory markers (leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) seen in this patient.

Celiac disease can present with diarrhea, weight loss, and bloating but it's unlikely given the absence of any mention of symptoms worsening with gluten intake and the presence of right lower quadrant pain.

Ulcerative colitis is a possibility given the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated inflammatory markers. However, ulcerative colitis typically presents with bloody diarrhea, which this patient does not have.

Crohn's disease, on the other hand, is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause intermittent abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and elevated inflammatory markers. It's also more common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, like this patient. Furthermore, the finding of right-sided colonic narrowing and ulceration on barium enema is typical for Crohn's disease, which unlike ulcerative colitis, can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and often shows a ""skip pattern"" of disease.",Crohn's disease.,Y,"This patient's history of intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, nausea, weight loss, a feeling of incomplete bowel emptying, and familial Ashkenazi Jewish descent, along with physical examination findings of right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, are suggestive of a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The laboratory findings further support a chronic inflammatory process with anemia (low hemoglobin), leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), thrombocytosis (elevated platelet count), and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate indicating inflammation. The barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing (stricture formation) of the right colon are characteristic of Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the GI tract from mouth to anus but most often involves the terminal ileum and right colon. It frequently presents in younger individuals and can have a genetic association, particularly with Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Therefore, this patient most likely has Crohn's disease.",Crohn's disease,Y,"This patient's presentation of long-standing lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, mild nausea, and unintentional weight loss along with the physical examination findings of right lower quadrant abdominal tenderness, is suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease. Additionally, the increased inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count), and thrombocytosis (increased platelet count) further support systemic inflammation often seen in these conditions.
Barium enema showing ulceration and narrowing of the right colon further points towards Crohn's disease specifically. Unlike ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus and is characterized by skip lesions, which result in patchy areas of disease interspersed with healthy tissue, which could lead to the described narrowing. Furthermore, this patient's Ashkenazi Jewish descent is a known risk factor for Crohn's disease. Lastly, the negative stool test for occult blood is not uncommon in Crohn's disease, as bleeding is not always present. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn's disease.",Crohn's disease.,Y,"Given the information in the question, let's apply Bayesian inference step by step:

The prior probability of Crohn's disease, given the population base rate, is around 0.3%. However, given the symptoms described (intermittent lower abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating, and weight loss), the probability of Crohn's disease increases.

The patient has a symptom of feeling like she cannot fully empty her bowels. This is a common symptom in inflammatory bowel disease, raising the probability of Crohn's disease to an estimated 15%.

The patient also has a family history of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, which increases the risk of Crohn's disease, taking the posterior probability to an estimated 30%.

The laboratory studies show elevated leukocyte count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate - these are signs of inflammation, which are consistent with Crohn's disease. This further increases the posterior probability of Crohn's disease to an estimated 50%.

The barium enema shows ulceration and narrowing of the right colon, a common sign of Crohn's disease, taking the final posterior probability to an estimated 75%.

These symptoms have been present for more than a month but less than six months, meeting the time criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to DSM-5. Furthermore, there's no evidence of substance use or other medical condition that could explain these symptoms. Therefore, schizophrenia is the most likely diagnosis.",Schizophrenia,N,"The differential for this patient includes: schizophrenia, major depressive disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, schizoaffective disorder, and drug-induced psychosis.

This patient presents with symptoms like disorganized speech, auditory hallucinations, and delusions, which indicate psychosis. However, the absence of a history of recreational drug use makes drug-induced psychosis unlikely.

Major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder can present with psychotic features, but they primarily manifest with mood symptoms such as mania or depression. In this case, the patient mentions feeling depressed and lack of interest in previously enjoyed activities, which could point towards depression but there's no mention of any manic episode to suggest bipolar disorder.

Schizoaffective disorder is a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia and mood disorder. However, the psychotic symptoms in schizoaffective disorder occur concurrently with a major mood episode (depression or mania). Since there's no evidence of a major mood episode, schizoaffective disorder seems unlikely.

On the other hand, schizophrenia is characterized by 2 or more of the following symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, disorganized/catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms (flat affect, alogia, or avolition), present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period, and continuous signs of the disturbance that persist for at least 6 months.

In this case, the constellation of symptoms, particularly delusions and hallucinations, strongly suggest a psychotic disorder. Given the patient's age and the duration of symptoms (4 months), this fits with the diagnosis of schizophrenia, which requires symptoms to be present for a minimum of six months, but a diagnosis can be made provisionally if symptoms are severe and debilitating, as in this case. It is important to note that while illicit substances can cause similar symptoms, the patient denies any substance use, making schizophrenia the most likely diagnosis.",Schizophrenia,N,"The prior probability of schizophrenia in the general population is approximately 1%. However, in this case, the boy's age, which is within the typical age of onset for schizophrenia (late teens to early 20s), increases the posterior probability slightly. Then, considering the patient's symptoms: delusions of persecution (belief about being secretly recorded), diminished interest in activities (anhedonia), and depression, the probability increases further. The presence of auditory hallucinations and disorganized speech, which are classic positive symptoms of schizophrenia, substantially increases the posterior probability of this disorder. Finally, observing negative symptoms like flat affect and his overall presentation being disheveled and unkempt, the probability of schizophrenia becomes very high. Given all these factors and the patient's clinical presentation, it's highly likely that this patient is suffering from schizophrenia.",Schizophrenia,N

His parents deny that he has ever had nosebleeds or bleeding from the gums, and they have never seen blood in his stool or urine. His mother notes that her brother has had similar problems. On physical exam, the patient has extensive bruising of the lateral left thigh and tenderness to palpation. Laboratory tests are performed and reveal the following:

Hemoglobin: 14 g/dL
Hematocrit: 41%
Mean corpuscular volume: 89 µm3
Reticulocyte count: 0.8%
Leukocyte count: 4,700/mm3
Prothrombin time (PT): 13 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 56 seconds
Bleeding time (BT): 4 minutes

What is the most likely underlying pathophysiology of this patient's presentation?",Factor VIII deficiency,Von Willebrand Disease,Y,von Willebrand Disease,Y,Bleeding disorder,N,Von Willebrand Disease,Y,von Willebrand disease,Y,,"The key clues in this case include the history of easy bruising, a normal prothrombin time (PT), and an increased partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This suggests that there's an issue with the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which is monitored by the PTT. This pathway includes factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII. The fact that there's a family history on the maternal side is suggestive of a X-linked recessive disorder, as males are more often affected in these disorders. Given these findings, the most likely underlying pathophysiology is Hemophilia A or B, which are coagulation disorders resulting from deficiency of factor VIII and IX respectively.",Hemophilia A or B,Y,"The differential for this patient's presentation includes hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, platelet function disorder, and Factor XI deficiency.

The patient's reported history of easy bruising but no other bleeding symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in stool or urine makes a systemic coagulopathy like von Willebrand disease less likely. His family history, with his mother's brother also having similar symptoms, points to an X-linked inheritance pattern, which is consistent with hemophilia.

In terms of lab findings, the patient's prothrombin time (PT) is normal, which suggests that the extrinsic and common clotting pathways are functioning correctly. However, the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged, which implies a defect in the intrinsic or common clotting pathways. This finding is indicative of hemophilia, which is a disorder of the intrinsic clotting pathway caused by deficiency of Factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or Factor IX (Hemophilia B).

The normal bleeding time (BT) excludes platelet function disorders and von Willebrand disease since BT is usually prolonged in these conditions. Hemophilia fits the clinical presentation and laboratory findings the best.",Hemophilia,Y,"This 6-year-old patient presents with easy bruising, especially after trauma (like playing soccer or falling from his scooter), which suggests a bleeding disorder. The fact that a similar issue is reported in his maternal uncle suggests a possible inherited condition. Notably, the patient's prothrombin time (PT) is normal, but his partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged. PT measures the functionality of the extrinsic and common coagulation pathways (including factors VII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen), while PTT assesses the intrinsic and common pathways (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II, and fibrinogen). Since PT is normal but PTT is prolonged, the problem likely resides within the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. This, along with the family history and the fact that it is a common cause of bleeding in males, leads us to suspect Hemophilia A or B, deficiencies of factor VIII and IX respectively, both of which are part of the intrinsic pathway.",Hemophilia A or B.,Y,"The patient's significant bruising, particularly with minor trauma, is suggestive of a bleeding disorder. His family history, specifically the maternal uncle with a similar problem, suggests an inherited condition. Given the age and sex of the patient, as well as the mother's brother having similar symptoms, an X-linked disorder is most likely.

The laboratory results show a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathways. The normal prothrombin time (PT) implies that the extrinsic pathway is functioning properly. This combination points toward a coagulation factor deficiency, specifically of one or more of the factors involved in the intrinsic pathway (factors VIII, IX, XI, or XII).

The most common inherited bleeding disorder with these features is hemophilia, which includes hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). The patient's clinical presentation of easy bruising and normal PT but increased PTT is most consistent with hemophilia. The exact type (A or B) cannot be determined from the information given.",Hemophilia,Y,"The Bayesian inference process involves an initial or ""prior"" probability, which is updated with additional evidence to yield a final or ""posterior"" probability.

In this case, the patient is a 6-year-old male with a tendency to bruise easily and a family history suggestive of a bleeding disorder (the mother's brother has had similar issues). Therefore, there's an increased prior probability for a bleeding disorder.

Prior probability of a coagulation disorder: ~10% given the tendency to bruise easily.
Family history suggestive of a bleeding disorder: increases the posterior probability to ~30%.
Abnormal partial thromboplastin time (PTT): PTT measures the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation, including factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen). An elevated PTT can suggest a deficiency or dysfunction in one of these factors, which further increases the probability of a coagulation disorder to ~60%.
Given the history and lab results, this patient most likely has Hemophilia A or B. Hemophilia A is a deficiency of factor VIII, and Hemophilia B is a deficiency of factor IX. Both conditions prolong the PTT, are inherited in an X-linked recessive manner (consistent with the uncle's similar problems), and lead to a tendency to bruise easily.",Hemophilia A or B.,Y
"A 25-year-old man comes to the physician because of right-sided painless scrotal swelling that he noticed yesterday while taking a shower. He is currently sexually active with two female partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He immigrated to the US from Argentina 2 years ago. His immunization records are unavailable. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 5 years. He is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 24.2 kg/m2. He appears healthy and well nourished. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 72/min, and blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft with dull lower abdominal discomfort. Testicular examination shows a solid mass in the right testis that is firm and nontender. A light held behind the scrotum does not shine through. The mass is not reduced when the patient is in a supine position. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Testicular tumor,Testicular cancer,Y,Testicular tumor,Y,Testicular cancer,Y,Testicular tumor,Y,Testicular tumor,Y,,"This patient presents with a painless, firm, non-transilluminating mass in the testis that was not reduced with supine positioning. These characteristics strongly suggest that the mass is intratesticular, which are generally malignant until proven otherwise. Given his age group (young adulthood), the most common type of testicular cancer is a germ cell tumor, which includes seminomas and nonseminomas. Therefore, based on the age and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer.",Testicular cancer.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes testicular cancer, inguinal hernia, epididymitis, orchitis, hydrocele, and varicocele. The key feature in this case is the presence of a solid, non-transilluminating mass in the testis that is not reduced when the patient is in a supine position. This points to a neoplasm rather than conditions like an inguinal hernia (which would typically reduce in the supine position) or a hydrocele (which would typically transilluminate). Epididymitis and orchitis would typically present with pain, which this patient does not have. Varicocele usually presents as a ""bag of worms"" feeling in the scrotum, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Furthermore, the patient's age, smoking history, and lack of consistent condom use, which increases the risk for sexually transmitted infections that can lead to testicular cancer, all support this diagnosis. Given these factors, the most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer.",Testicular cancer,Y,"This patient presents with right-sided scrotal swelling, described as a solid mass that is firm and non-tender, with transillumination test being negative (a light held behind the scrotum does not shine through). These findings are suggestive of a testicular mass, most likely a testicular tumor. Given the patient's age, the most common form of testicular cancer is a germ cell tumor, which includes seminomas and non-seminomas. It is important to note that risk factors include a history of cryptorchidism, familial history of testicular cancer, and being of a Caucasian race, although none of these are mentioned in this case.",Testicular cancer,Y,"The presence of a painless solid mass in the right testis that doesn't allow light to shine through, often referred to as negative transillumination, is a strong indicator of a testicular tumor. In a young man like the patient described, testicular cancer is the most common form of solid testicular mass. Risk factors for testicular cancer include a history of cryptorchidism (undescended testis), family history, Caucasian race, and previous testicular cancer. It's worth noting that factors like smoking and sexual activity are not typically associated with the development of testicular cancer. As the patient's mass is firm, non-tender, and doesn't reduce in a supine position, these are all consistent with a tumor rather than other potential causes of testicular enlargement such as hydrocele or varicocele.",Testicular cancer,Y,"The prior probability of testicular cancer in a 25-year-old male is relatively low, around 0.1%, as testicular cancer is relatively rare. However, this patient presents with a firm, non-tender, solid testicular mass that does not transilluminate, which significantly raises the likelihood of testicular cancer to around 40%. Testicular cancer often presents as a painless lump in the testicle. The fact that the mass cannot be reduced when the patient is in a supine position eliminates the possibility of an inguinal hernia, further increasing the posterior probability of testicular cancer to around 60%. Given the fact that the patient is a young man and testicular cancer is the most common cancer in males aged 20-35, the probability of testicular cancer further increases to 80%. In the absence of other symptoms such as a cough or weight loss, which might suggest conditions like tuberculosis or lymphoma, and in the context of a testicular mass, testicular cancer is the most likely diagnosis.",Testicular cancer,Y
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of persistent fever and cough. Three days ago, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and acute otitis media. He was started on ampicillin-sulbactam and clarithromycin, but his symptoms did not improve. The mother reports that her son has been hospitalized 3 times due to pneumonia. He was first diagnosed with pneumonia at the age of 10 months. She also reports several episodes of bilateral otitis media and recurrent respiratory tract infections. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 50th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Pneumatic otoscopy shows purulent otorrhea bilaterally. Pulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds over both lung fields. The palatine tonsils and adenoids are hypoplastic. What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",Tyrosine kinase gene mutation,Primary immunodeficiency,N,Primary immunodeficiency,N,Primary immunodeficiency,N,Immunodeficiency,N,Primary immunodeficiency,N,,"The child presents with recurrent respiratory infections, including multiple bouts of pneumonia and otitis media, despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. The persistence of these infections and the fact that they are occurring recurrently suggests there might be an underlying immunodeficiency. Specifically, the mention of hypoplastic (underdeveloped) tonsils and adenoids is a clue to a B cell deficiency, as these tissues are key components of the humoral immune system. B cells are responsible for the production of antibodies, which help protect against bacterial and some viral infections. One particular disorder that matches this description is X-linked agammaglobulinemia. This condition primarily affects males and is characterized by the body's inability to produce antibodies, leading to recurrent bacterial infections.",X-linked agammaglobulinemia.,Y,"The differential for this patient includes various causes of recurrent infections, particularly respiratory tract infections, such as cystic fibrosis, primary immunodeficiency diseases (e.g., agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency), or anatomical abnormalities leading to repeated infections. However, given the early onset, repeated pneumonia, recurrent otitis media, and notably, hypoplastic tonsils and adenoids, a type of primary immunodeficiency, specifically, X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) could be the cause. XLA affects B-lymphocytes, leading to a lack of mature B cells and, consequently, a severe reduction in all types of immunoglobulins. This results in a high susceptibility to extracellular bacterial infections, including infections by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, which commonly cause pneumonia and otitis media. The lack of mature B cells also results in the underdevelopment of lymphoid tissues, such as the tonsils and adenoids, a distinguishing feature that helps differentiate XLA from other causes of recurrent ",X-linked Agammaglobulinemia.,Y,"The patient's recurrent respiratory infections (e.g., pneumonia and otitis media), despite being appropriately immunized and treated with antibiotics, are indicative of an immune deficiency. The presence of hypoplastic tonsils and adenoids also suggests an immunodeficiency, as these tissues are normally involved in immune responses to respiratory pathogens. Given the age at which symptoms started, the pattern of infections, and the underdeveloped lymphoid tissue, one of the most likely diagnoses is X-linked agammaglobulinemia. This condition is characterized by the absence or very low levels of all classes of immunoglobulins, leading to susceptibility to infections, especially respiratory and gastrointestinal ones. Typically, symptoms begin to appear around 6 months of age, when maternal antibody protection wanes.",X-linked Agammaglobulinemia,Y,"This patient's history of recurrent and persistent infections, particularly pneumonia and otitis media, at such a young age strongly suggests an underlying immunodeficiency. The fact that these infections have not responded well to antibiotics, which would be expected to be effective against the common causative organisms, provides further support for this hypothesis. Among immunodeficiencies, those affecting the body's ability to mount a humoral immune response would be particularly likely to result in these recurrent respiratory infections. The observation that the palatine tonsils and adenoids are hypoplastic suggests that the patient is having difficulty generating an effective B-cell response, as these tissues are primary sites of B-cell activity. Therefore, the patient's symptoms could be due to an underlying humoral (B-cell) immunodeficiency disorder. Among these, Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) or X-linked agammaglobulinemia could be considered, however, due to the early onset of the recurrent infections in the patient (10 months old), X-linked agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's disease) is more likely as CVID usually presents later in life.",X-linked agammaglobulinemia,Y,"The prior probability of an immunodeficiency in a child with multiple and recurrent serious infections is about 10%. This child's persistent pneumonia despite antibiotic treatment increases the probability of an immunodeficiency to 30%. The repeated episodes of bilateral otitis media increase the probability to 50%. The history of recurrent respiratory tract infections further increases the likelihood to 60%. Notably, the hypoplasia of the palatine tonsils and adenoids is highly suggestive of an abnormality in the B-cell function, as these tissues are key components of the body's humoral immune response. This is commonly seen in conditions like Selective IgA deficiency, Common variable immunodeficiency, and especially in X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's disease). Given that this child has had repeated bacterial infections from infancy, the latter is more likely. The presence of these signs further increases the posterior probability of X-linked agammaglobulinemia to 80%. Thus, this child likely has X-linked agammaglobulinemia.",X-linked Agammaglobulinemia,Y
"A 67-year-old farmer presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of unusual behavior. His wife states that since this morning he has experienced dryness and flushing of his skin while working outside. As the day went on, the patient found it exceedingly difficult to urinate and had to create significant abdominal pressure for a weak stream of urine to be produced. Currently, the patient seems confused and responds incoherently. The patient has a past medical history of Parkinson's disease, alcohol abuse, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, constipation and a suicide attempt when he was 23 years old. He is currently taking lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazie, metformin, insulin, benztropine, levodopa/carbidopa, and vitamin C. The only other notable symptoms this patient has experienced are recent severe seasonal allergies. On physical exam you note dry, flushed skin, and a confused gentleman. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Lab values are ordered. What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",Medication,Anticholinergic toxicity,Y,Anticholinergic toxicity.,Y,Anticholinergic toxicity,Y,Anticholinergic toxicity,Y,Anticholinergic toxicity,Y,,"This patient presents with several symptoms that could be suggestive of an anticholinergic syndrome - dryness and flushing of skin, urinary retention, and confusion. The anticholinergic syndrome is usually caused by medications that block the action of acetylcholine in the brain, such as the Parkinson's disease drug benztropine that the patient is currently taking. Symptoms of this syndrome include flushed skin, fever, urinary retention, dilated pupils, dry skin and mucous membranes, and altered mental status. As this patient is a farmer, it's also possible he was exposed to certain pesticides or plants that can cause similar symptoms, but given the symptom onset and the medication history, the benztropine seems more likely.",Benztropine usage,Y,"The differential diagnoses for this patient's presentation can include heat stroke, urinary retention due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, drug side effect, or anticholinergic poisoning.

Heat stroke may present with dry skin and confusion, but is less likely to cause urinary difficulty. Urinary retention can occur with advancing age and is a possible cause of this patient's urinary issues but it does not explain the other symptoms such as dry and flushed skin and confusion.

Certain drugs, like benztropine that the patient is taking for Parkinson's disease, can have anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and confusion, but these side effects typically occur shortly after starting the drug or increasing the dose, which does not seem to be the case here.

Finally, anticholinergic poisoning presents with a classic triad of altered mental status (confusion), autonomic dysfunction (flushed skin, tachycardia), and decreased bowel sounds. This patient's symptoms are consistent with this presentation. Given the patient's history of a previous suicide attempt, his recent worsening allergies (a situation in which he might have taken an over-the-counter anticholinergic medication like diphenhydramine for symptom relief), and his current symptoms, anticholinergic poisoning is the most likely diagnosis.",Anticholinergic poisoning.,Y,"This patient's history and presentation is suggestive of anticholinergic toxicity. Anticholinergic effects can include dry mouth, urinary retention, tachycardia, flushing, decreased bowel movements, and confusion, all of which this patient is demonstrating. Benztropine, which the patient is taking for his Parkinson's disease, is an anticholinergic medication. It is possible that the patient overdosed or has become overly sensitive to this medication, especially given his history of a suicide attempt. However, an alternative explanation could be an anticholinergic effect from a medication used to manage his severe seasonal allergies - many over-the-counter allergy medications have anticholinergic properties. Therefore, it is important to determine whether he has been taking any new or over-the-counter medications. Lab tests could include testing for toxidromes, although the results may not be immediately available.",Anticholinergic toxicity,Y,"The patient's presentation of dry and flushed skin, difficulty urinating, and confusion is suggestive of an anticholinergic syndrome. Anticholinergic syndrome is characterized by dryness of mucosal membranes, urinary retention, altered mental status (AMS), mydriasis (dilated pupils), and flushed, hot skin due to inhibition of parasympathetic innervation. This is often summarized as ""blind as a bat, mad as a hatter, red as a beet, hot as a hare, and dry as a bone.""

A significant clue to the etiology of the anticholinergic syndrome is in the patient's medications: benztropine, which is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, has significant anticholinergic properties. Furthermore, the anticholinergic effects can be potentiated by certain antihistamines, which the patient might have started taking recently for his severe seasonal allergies. Hence, the patient's anticholinergic syndrome is likely due to a combination of his ongoing treatment with benztropine and possible recent addition of an over-the-counter antihistamine for his allergies.",Anticholinergic syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of an anticholinergic toxicity in this setting might be around 5% given his symptoms and the medications he is taking. The presence of confusion can be attributed to many conditions, but considering the other symptoms, it could increase the posterior probability of anticholinergic toxicity to 15%. The presence of urinary retention increases the probability further to 30%. The finding of dry and flushed skin, which are classic signs of anticholinergic toxicity, would increase the probability to 60%. The final key piece of information is that the patient is taking benztropine for Parkinson's disease, a known anticholinergic, which could have been accidentally overused. This would increase the probability of an anticholinergic toxicity to a very high likelihood, around 85%.",Anticholinergic toxicity,Y

Furthermore, the presence of motor tics can be indicative of a tic disorder or Tourette Syndrome, which can often co-occur with OCD. The mention of the mother's history of needing close medical follow-up, while not specific, could suggest a genetic component to the child's condition as both OCD and tic disorders have genetic components. Thus, given her symptoms, OCD is the most likely diagnosis.",Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,Y,"The differential for this patient includes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Tourette's syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or generalized anxiety disorder.

The patient's compulsive and repetitive behaviors such as combing her dolls' hair for hours without stopping and counting her steps around the house, coupled with the distress these actions cause when confronted, align with the diagnostic criteria for OCD. OCD is characterized by recurrent and persistent thoughts, urges, or images that are intrusive and unwanted (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly (compulsions).

However, it's important to consider the occurrence of motor tics in the differential diagnosis as they are not typically associated with OCD. This may suggest a tic disorder, such as Tourette's syndrome, which can often co-occur with OCD. Since the motor tics are mentioned as occasional and there is no mention of vocal tics, Tourette's syndrome becomes less likely.

"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents with complaints of short stature with small hands and skin hypopigmentation. A detailed development history reveals that he was born by normal vaginal delivery at full term and his neonatal period was uneventful. Until he was 6 months of age, he was breast-fed and then solid foods were started. At the age of 3 years, his parents noted that he had difficulty in sucking and swallowing. They also noted a weak cry. His motor milestones were delayed. His intelligence quotient (IQ) is 65. His temperature is 37.0ºC (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 20/min. He has a short stature and falls in the obese category according to his body mass index. His neurologic examination shows the presence of hypotonia. Panoramic radiographic examination shows anterior teeth crowding and the presence of residual roots in some teeth. What is the most likely cause of this condition?",Paternal inheritance,Prader-Willi Syndrome,Y,Prader-Willi Syndrome,Y,Prader-Willi Syndrome,Y,Down syndrome,N,Down Syndrome,N,,"This 10-year-old boy presents with several notable signs and symptoms. He has short stature, small hands, hypopigmentation of the skin, and obesity according to his BMI. His developmental history also points to delayed motor milestones and difficulty with feeding (difficulty sucking and swallowing, weak cry), along with a lower IQ than expected for his age, which indicates a global developmental delay. These findings along with the hypotonia noted on his neurologic examination are suggestive of a genetic condition. The most likely cause of this patient's condition, considering all these symptoms, is Prader-Willi syndrome. Prader-Willi syndrome is a complex genetic condition that affects many parts of the body, it typically causes poor muscle tone (hypotonia), short stature, incomplete sexual development, cognitive disabilities, problem behaviors, a chronic feeling of hunger that can lead to excessive eating and life-threatening obesity, and distinctive facial features.",Prader-Willi syndrome,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a few conditions. Conditions causing short stature, obesity, developmental delay, and hypotonia include Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, hypothyroidism, or a metabolic syndrome. Down syndrome typically presents with specific physical characteristics such as distinct facial features, single palmar crease, and hyperflexibility, none of which are mentioned here. Hypothyroidism usually presents with other symptoms including constipation, lethargy, and cold intolerance, which are also not mentioned here. A metabolic syndrome might present with a variety of symptoms and would not necessarily explain all of the patient's symptoms specifically.

PWS is a genetic disorder due to loss of function of specific genes on the paternal chromosome 15. The early feeding difficulties, developmental delays, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and later onset obesity are classic for this condition.",Prader-Willi syndrome,Y,"This patient's symptoms of short stature, small hands, obesity, intellectual impairment (IQ of 65), difficulty in sucking and swallowing, weak cry, delayed motor milestones, hypotonia, and unusual dental findings all suggest a genetic disorder. These clinical features are highly suggestive of Prader-Willi syndrome, a disorder caused by lack of expression of certain paternal genes located on chromosome 15. This disorder is also associated with hypopigmentation, and obesity due to hyperphagia, as seen in this patient.",Prader-Willi syndrome,Y,"This child presents with several findings including short stature, obesity, hypotonia, intellectual disability, and hypopigmentation, which together suggest a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This is a genetic disorder caused by the loss of function of genes in a specific region of chromosome 15 (paternal). Some of the typical features include neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties in infancy followed by hyperphagia leading to obesity in later life, intellectual impairment, hypogonadism, and characteristic behaviors (such as a narrow interest and obsessive routines). The hypotonia would also cause weakness in cry, difficulties in sucking and swallowing, and motor milestone delay. The teeth findings can be explained by the gene defect and are common in PWS.",Prader-Willi syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of Prader-Willi Syndrome in a patient presenting with general symptoms of short stature, obesity and hypopigmentation is around 1%. The presence of these key symptoms in the child increases the posterior probability of Prader-Willi Syndrome to approximately 10%. When we add in the history of feeding difficulties and a weak cry during infancy, the posterior probability further increases to 30%. Delayed motor milestones contribute to raising the probability to 50%. Further, an IQ of 65, which is lower than average, points towards mental retardation, a common symptom in Prader-Willi syndrome, increasing the posterior probability to 70%. Finally, hypotonia, observed during the neurologic examination, is a common clinical feature of Prader-Willi syndrome, which increases the probability to 85%. Taken together, these findings suggest a high likelihood of Prader-Willi Syndrome.",Prader-Willi Syndrome,Y
"A 9-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a fever and a change in her behavior. She presented with similar symptoms 6 weeks ago and was treated for an Escherchia coli infection. She also was treated for a urinary tract infection 10 weeks ago. Her mother says that last night her daughter felt ill and her condition has been worsening. Her daughter experienced a severe headache and had a stiff neck. This morning she was minimally responsive, vomited several times, and produced a small amount of dark cloudy urine. The patient was born at 39 weeks and met all her developmental milestones. She is currently up to date on her vaccinations. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg, pulse is 190/min, respirations are 33/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

What is the best underlying explanation for this patient's presentation?",Intentional contamination,Meningitis,N,Meningitis.,N,Meningitis,N,Meningitis,N,Meningitis,N,,"The girl has recurrent infections, including urinary tract infection and Escherchia coli infection, suggesting some underlying immune system issue or problem in urinary tract. She now presents with fever, headache, and a stiff neck, suggesting meningitis or some central nervous system infection. Moreover, she has a reduced level of consciousness, vomiting, and hypotension, which indicates a septic shock condition. Given her history of urinary tract infections, it is possible that she may have a vesicoureteral reflux, which is a condition where urine flows retrograde, or backward, from the bladder into the ureters/kidneys. This condition predisposes patients to recurrent urinary tract infections and can potentially lead to renal scarring, and in severe cases, can lead to systemic infection such as urosepsis, which appears to be the case with this patient.",Vesicoureteral reflux,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes recurrent urinary tract infections, sepsis, meningitis, autoimmune conditions, and potentially a renal or urinary tract abnormality. The repeated infections indicate that there might be a primary issue leading to the patient's susceptibility to infections. Her current presentation of fever, behavioral change, severe headache, stiff neck, and hypotension could suggest a central nervous system infection, like meningitis, particularly given her recent history of E. coli infection (which can occasionally lead to meningitis). However, the dark, cloudy urine might suggest a urinary tract source for her symptoms. The sepsis-like presentation (fever, hypotension, tachycardia) could also be the result of a severe urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, which can be secondary to an anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract. This could have contributed to her repeated urinary infections and now her severe illness. Therefore, a renal or urinary tract abnormality causing recurrent urinary tract infections and subsequent sepsis is a likely underlying cause for her presentation.",Urinary tract abnormality,N,"This child has a history of multiple infections, including recurrent urinary tract infections. Her current presentation with fever, behavioral changes, severe headache, stiff neck, and symptoms of shock (tachycardia, hypotension, and tachypnea) along with dark cloudy urine is suggestive of sepsis, likely secondary to a severe urinary tract infection or possibly meningitis given her neurological symptoms. The recurrent nature of these severe infections suggests an underlying immune deficiency. Of these, complement deficiencies are a known risk factor for recurrent bacterial infections, especially with encapsulated organisms like Escherichia coli. Therefore, a complement system deficiency is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's repeated severe infections and her current presentation.",Complement system deficiency,N,"This young patient has had multiple bacterial infections, including Escherichia coli and a urinary tract infection. These recurrent bacterial infections, combined with the current presentation of fever, behavior change, headache, stiff neck, reduced responsiveness, vomiting, and dark cloudy urine, suggest a disseminated infection, likely bacterial meningitis or sepsis. The low blood pressure and high pulse rate suggest a state of shock, possibly septic shock. Dark cloudy urine could indicate a urinary tract infection, kidney involvement or a more severe condition such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) typically caused by certain strains of E.coli which produce Shiga toxin. However, given the recurrent infections and severe systemic illness, one should also consider an underlying immune deficiency. Immunodeficiencies can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections, including those caused by bacteria such as E.coli. In this case, the patient could have an underlying primary immunodeficiency disorder, which would render her more susceptible to recurrent infections.",Primary immunodeficiency disorder,N,"The prior probability of sepsis due to a recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) in this 9-year-old girl is 5%. The fact that she has had two previous episodes of infection, one of which was a UTI, increases the posterior probability of a recurrent UTI and subsequent sepsis to 15%. The symptoms of fever, behavioral change, and a history of recent infections, elevate this probability to 30%. The severe headache and stiff neck, indicative of possible meningitis, a known complication of sepsis, further increase the likelihood to 50%. Her hypotension, high pulse rate, and the need for vasopressors strongly indicate septic shock, taking the probability to 70%. Dark and cloudy urine suggests a urinary tract focus of infection, boosting the probability to 85%. Given this data, the best explanation for this patient's presentation is sepsis likely stemming from a recurrent urinary tract infection, which has progressed to septic shock with possible meningitis.",Sepsis from recurrent UTI.,N

Absence of breath sounds on the left and the presence of crepitus around the left shoulder level suggests air in the subcutaneous tissue, which could have resulted from significant trauma to the chest. All these symptoms suggest a high likelihood of a tension pneumothorax, a condition in which air accumulates in the pleural space and increases the intrathoracic pressure, subsequently reducing venous return to the heart and leading to shock.",Tension pneumothorax.,N,"The differential for this patient includes: pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, flail chest, rib fracture, and myocardial infarction. The high speed accident and subsequent severe pain and shortness of breath suggest a traumatic injury. The patient has tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate, which are suggestive of shock, possibly due to blood loss or inadequate oxygenation. The absence of breath sounds on the left side along with the abnormal movement of the left chest wall (which moves inward during inspiration) suggests a traumatic injury to the chest causing paradoxical chest wall movement, a condition known as flail chest. A flail chest occurs when a segment of the rib cage breaks due to trauma and becomes detached from the rest of the chest wall. Therefore, this patient most likely has flail chest.",Flail chest.,Y,"The patient in the scenario provided is presenting with symptoms that are indicative of a severe traumatic injury, likely from his motor vehicle accident.

These symptoms are highly suggestive of a traumatic injury such as a flail chest (which is indicated by paradoxical chest movement) and possibly a tension pneumothorax (which could explain the absence of breath sounds).

The finding that the upper part of the left chest wall moves inward during inspiration is typical of a flail chest, a severe injury where a segment of the rib cage is detached from the rest of the chest wall. However, the absence of breath sounds on one side is a classic sign of a pneumothorax, which can occur with rib fractures. Given the severity of his respiratory distress and hypotension, a tension pneumothorax is likely. In this condition, air continues to leak into the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased intrathoracic pressure, collapse of the lung, and decreased venous return to the heart, causing hypotension and tachycardia.

This patient's lesions are nonpainful, hyperkeratotic, sessile, and turned white with the application of acetic acid. Hemorrhoids typically present with blood in the stool and pain is often associated with anal fissures and abscesses. While malignancies are a consideration, they would typically not respond to acetic acid in the manner described. The key clue in the vignette is the change in color with the application of acetic acid, which is a characteristic feature of anal warts (condyloma acuminata) caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), especially given her history of inconsistent condom use which puts her at higher risk for sexually transmitted infections.",Human Papillomavirus (HPV),Y,"This patient's clinical presentation of nontender, irregular, hyperkeratotic sessile lesions in the perianal area and her sexual history point towards an infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV).

His sexual history, specifically having unprotected sex with a new partner, also raises the suspicion for a sexually transmitted disease such as hepatitis. Hepatitis can be transmitted through unprotected sexual contact and can cause symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal pain, jaundice, and elevated liver enzymes. In this case, the constellation of symptoms, liver enzyme elevation, and the risk factor of recent unprotected sexual activity suggest a diagnosis of hepatitis, likely viral hepatitis.",Viral Hepatitis,N,"The differential diagnoses for this patient can include: congestive heart failure, viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and congestive hepatopathy. His symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and his history of recent unprotected sex point toward a possibility of viral hepatitis, while his history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and obesity could suggest non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, his elevated hemoglobin, along with the liver abnormalities and the lack of any obvious alcohol history, are more suggestive of hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption leading to iron overload in tissues, especially the liver. Over time, this iron overload can result in hepatomegaly, liver damage, and high hemoglobin levels as we see in this patient. To confirm, genetic testing or liver biopsy showing iron overload would be needed.",Hemochromatosis,N,"This patient has symptoms suggestive of liver disease, such as jaundice, abdominal distension, and tender hepatomegaly, along with significantly elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). His hemoglobin level is also notably high, which can occur with chronic hypoxia, polycythemia vera, or secondary polycythemia due to conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cyanotic heart disease, or chronic carbon monoxide exposure. His history of being a retired painter indicates a potential long-term exposure to volatile organic compounds, including toluene, which are hepatotoxic and could also potentially cause hypoxic conditions leading to secondary polycythemia. Given his history, the most likely cause of his symptoms is chronic liver disease, possibly secondary to long-term occupational exposure to hepatotoxic substances.",Chronic liver disease,N,"This patient's presentation of abdominal pain, jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes suggests hepatic pathology. His sexual history and lack of consistent condom use raise the possibility of sexually transmitted infections, including Hepatitis B and C, which can lead to acute hepatitis. The presence of fatigue, breathlessness, and high hemoglobin might be related to polycythemia, which can occur secondary to chronic hypoxia (such as in heavy smokers or in certain lung diseases), or due to hepatic disease, as liver synthesizes erythropoietin which can stimulate erythropoiesis. However, considering his sexual history and liver findings, a hepatitis infection seems more likely.",Hepatitis infection,N,"The prior probability of hepatitis due to a sexually transmitted infection (STI), like Hepatitis B or C, in this patient may initially be low, given his age and overall health status. However, several key factors increase the posterior probability. First, the patient's recent sexual activity without consistent condom use increases the probability of an STI, increasing the likelihood of hepatitis to around 15%. Then, his presenting symptoms of jaundice, tender hepatomegaly, and high liver enzyme levels, further increase the posterior probability of hepatitis to around 45%. The patient's elevated hemoglobin level also may indicate polycythemia, which can occur in chronic conditions like liver disease, further increasing the probability of hepatitis to 60%.

What is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",Varicella zoster infection,Vitamin B12 deficiency,N,Vitamin B12 deficiency.,N,Vitamin B12 deficiency,N,Vitamin B12 deficiency,N,Vitamin B12 deficiency,N,,"The patient is a 5-year-old boy who has recently developed issues with balance and coordination, including difficulty walking and performing tasks that require fine motor skills. These symptoms suggest a problem affecting the cerebellum, which is involved in controlling balance and coordination. The fact that the family adheres to a vegetarian diet is also significant. This type of diet, particularly if not carefully balanced, may lead to nutritional deficiencies. The presence of faint hyperpigmented macules on the chest may suggest vitamin deficiency as well, such as pellagra which is caused by a deficiency of niacin (vitamin B3). However, pellagra doesn't cause cerebellar signs like ataxia and dysmetria (difficulty with depth perception), seen in this boy.
The most likely culprit is a vitamin B12 deficiency. B12 is vital for neurological function and its deficiency could cause subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, leading to symptoms such as ataxia, as well as hyperpigmentation. Vegetarian diets, particularly vegan diets, are a known risk factor for vitamin B12 deficiency, as B12 is primarily found in animal-derived foods.",Vitamin B12 deficiency.,N,"The differential diagnosis for this 5-year-old boy includes neurologic disorders (like a cerebellar tumor or multiple sclerosis), vitamin deficiencies (like B12 or E due to the vegetarian diet), genetic disorders (like Friedreich's ataxia), and infectious diseases (like meningitis).

The history of poor balance, difficulty walking, and inability to perform rapidly-alternating palm movements are suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. His vegetarian diet and the lack of routine childhood vaccinations raises the possibility of vitamin B12 deficiency (as B12 is mostly found in animal-derived foods) or an infectious disease. However, his normal vitals and the absence of other symptoms such as fever make an acute infection less likely.

The presence of faint hyperpigmented macules on his chest are not typical for any of the aforementioned conditions but can be seen in cases of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause hyperpigmentation due to increased melanin synthesis. The family's vegetarian diet might have limited his intake of B12. Vitamin B12 deficiency in children can lead to a variety of symptoms including neurologic abnormalities, such as ataxia and poor motor coordination.

Given these factors, vitamin B12 deficiency due to the vegetarian diet is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms.",Vitamin B12 deficiency.,N,"This patient has a broad-based, staggering gait (ataxia) and difficulty with rapid alternating movements (dysdiadochokinesia), both of which suggest cerebellar dysfunction. He also has difficulty with fine motor skills such as tying his shoes. The combination of these symptoms, along with a strict vegetarian diet and lack of routine childhood vaccinations, suggest vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for myelin synthesis and its deficiency can result in a range of neurologic manifestations, including ataxia and loss of fine motor control. A vegetarian diet without appropriate supplementation may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, as the vitamin is primarily found in animal products. Hyperpigmented macules on the skin may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency as well.",Vitamin B12 deficiency,N,"This patient's clinical presentation of ataxia, difficulty with fine motor skills (tying shoes, dressing), and impaired proprioception (broad-based, staggering gait) indicate a disorder of the posterior columns of the spinal cord or the cerebellum. The hyperpigmented macules on the chest suggest an underlying condition that might also involve the skin. Given this child's adherence to a vegetarian diet, a possibility to consider is vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12, mainly obtained from animal sources, is essential for myelin synthesis in the nervous system. Deficiency leads to demyelination in the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, causing the aforementioned symptoms. Additionally, B12 deficiency can result in hyperpigmentation of the skin due to increased melanin synthesis. The fact that the child has not received any routine childhood vaccinations doesn't seem directly related to the current symptoms but can indicate a more general neglect of health-related issues including nutritional deficiencies.",Vitamin B12 deficiency,N,"The boy's symptoms of poor balance, difficulty walking, and trouble with tasks requiring fine motor control suggest a neurological issue. Initial Bayesian analysis would give a variety of potential causes including infection, trauma, genetic disorders, or nutritional deficiencies. This child's diet is vegetarian, which makes B12 deficiency a possibility. The probability starts off relatively low, given many possible causes of the symptoms, say at 10%.

The presence of hyperpigmented macules on the chest could be a symptom of B12 deficiency as it can cause hyperpigmentation. This would increase our posterior probability of B12 deficiency to around 30%.

The observation that the boy is able to maintain his strength and his deep tendon reflexes are 1+ bilaterally suggests that this is not a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, but rather a disorder of the central nervous system, like B12 deficiency can cause. The fact that it is not peripheral would further increase our posterior probability of B12 deficiency, to perhaps 50%.

Finally, the family's adherence to a vegetarian diet significantly increases the likelihood of vitamin B12 deficiency, as B12 is typically acquired through animal products. The lack of routine childhood vaccinations indicates the possibility of a family lifestyle that may neglect other aspects of conventional health wisdom, such as supplementation for vegetarian diets. Taking these into account, the posterior probability of B12 deficiency might rise to around 80%. This child most likely has a Vitamin B12 deficiency.",Vitamin B12 Deficiency,N

The history of poorly controlled diabetes can make the patient more susceptible to infections including urinary tract infections, which can ascend to cause pyelonephritis.",Pyelonephritis,N,"The differential for this patient includes urinary tract infection (UTI), pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), ovarian cyst, and appendicitis. Her symptoms of flank pain, urinary frequency, and fever suggest a UTI or pyelonephritis. The presence of positive urine glucose and a history of poorly controlled diabetes also point towards an infection, as high glucose levels can increase the risk for bacterial growth. The tenderness with percussion along the flank (costovertebral angle tenderness) is more suggestive of pyelonephritis than a lower urinary tract infection. Furthermore, her left hip pain on passive extension may be due to irritation of the psoas muscle, a sign frequently associated with retroperitoneal processes, including pyelonephritis. The absence of abdominal abnormalities on ultrasound reduces the likelihood of nephrolithiasis, ovarian cyst, or appendicitis. Finally, her leukocytosis supports the diagnosis of an infection, like pyelonephritis.",Pyelonephritis,N,"This patient has symptoms of left flank pain, fever, tenderness to percussion along the left flank, and pain on passive extension of the left hip, all of which suggest pyelonephritis, especially when associated with a high leukocyte count. The finding of 3+ glucose in her urine is a reflection of her poorly controlled diabetes, which also makes her more susceptible to infections like urinary tract infections and their progression to pyelonephritis. The increased urinary frequency may also be a symptom of a urinary tract infection. Her negative abdominal ultrasound and pregnancy test rule out other common causes of lower abdominal pain and urinary frequency in a woman of childbearing age.",Pyelonephritis,N,"This patient presents with left flank pain, urinary frequency, and fever which suggests a urinary tract infection (UTI). The positive urine glucose test and history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes increases her risk for UTIs. However, the presence of left lower quadrant tenderness, tenderness on left flank percussion, and pain during passive extension of the hip suggest that the infection may have ascended from the bladder to the kidney, causing pyelonephritis. Additionally, the white blood cell count is elevated, which is a common systemic response to infection. Finally, her negative abdominal ultrasound rules out other potential causes of her symptoms, such as kidney stones or other structural abnormalities.",Pyelonephritis,N,"The prior probability of pyelonephritis is 5% given the patient's age, sex, and presenting symptoms. The patient's history of type 1 diabetes, particularly poorly controlled, increases the likelihood of an infectious process, which may increase the posterior probability of pyelonephritis to 20%. The patient's history of inconsistent condom use doesn't alter this probability significantly, as urinary tract infections are typically not sexually transmitted.

The presence of flank pain, increased urinary frequency, and leukocytosis further increase the probability of pyelonephritis to 50%. Tenderness on percussion of the flank (a positive Murphy's punch sign) is suggestive of an upper urinary tract infection, pushing the posterior probability of pyelonephritis to 70%.

The absence of any findings on the abdominal ultrasound does not exclude pyelonephritis, as the condition is often diagnosed clinically based on symptoms and may not show any significant findings on imaging.

The patient's elevated temperature and left hip pain upon passive extension, however, don't significantly alter the posterior probability further as these findings can be seen in a variety of conditions.

Given the constellation of symptoms, history, and lab findings, the patient most likely has pyelonephritis.",Pyelonephritis,N

Given the recent initiation of the antibiotic and the presentation of his symptoms, this is indicative of a severe drug reaction. The specific condition here, characterized by skin detachment covering less than 10% of the body surface area, is likely Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a type of severe skin reaction commonly triggered by medications, including antibiotics like sulfamethoxazole.",Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes drug hypersensitivity reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS). All these conditions could present with fever, skin rash, and systemic symptoms. Given the recent start of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (a known high-risk medication) and 20% body surface area involvement of skin sloughing, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis become more likely. Stevens-Johnson syndrome typically involves less than 10% of body surface area, while TEN involves more than 30% usually. The patient's 20% TBSA involvement with skin sloughing and scattered vesicles and erosions throughout his face and extremities are consistent with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis overlap syndrome.

The lack of mucosal involvement in this case, in addition to the severity of the skin findings, are more suggestive of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), a severe cutaneous adverse reaction often triggered by medications. SJS is characterized by widespread epidermal and mucosal detachment and necrosis. Although some overlap exists, SJS is generally differentiated from another severe cutaneous adverse reaction, toxic epidermal necrolysis, by the extent of skin detachment (SJS <10% total body surface area vs TEN >30%).",Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.,Y,"This patient's presentation of fever, rash, and skin sloughing after starting trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a sulfonamide antibiotic, is suggestive of a severe drug reaction. In particular, the symptoms align with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), a rare but serious skin disorder often triggered by medications, in which there is a severe reaction causing the skin and mucous membranes to blister, die, and shed. This condition typically starts with flu-like symptoms followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters, leading to the top layer of the skin dying, sloughing off, and healing. This disease typically involves less than 10% of the body surface area, but can progress to more widespread involvement, at which point it becomes Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN). Since this patient has 20% TBSA involvement, the diagnosis leans more towards TEN. However, the absence of widespread mucosal involvement, which is more characteristic of TEN, makes this a challenging diagnosis. The patient's recent initiation of sulfonamide therapy and the clinical presentation most likely points to SJS/TEN overlap syndrome.",SJS/TEN overlap syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of Steven-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) in general population is extremely low (<1%).

"A 67-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of headaches in her left temple and scalp area, neck stiffness, occasional blurred vision, and pain in her jaw when chewing. The appropriate medical therapy is initiated, and a subsequent biopsy of the temporal artery reveals arteritis. Five months later, the patient returns to her physician with a complaint of weakness, leading to difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair, and combing her hair. The patient states that this weakness has worsened gradually over the last 2 months. She reports that her headaches, jaw pain, and visual disturbances have resolved. Physical examination is significant for 4/5 strength for both hip flexion/extension as well as shoulder flexion/extension/abduction.

Considering the patient's age and the pattern of weakness, the most likely diagnosis would be Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). PMR is often associated with Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), the disease she was previously diagnosed with and treated for, as indicated by her initial symptoms of temporal headache, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances, and temporal artery biopsy. Therefore, her new symptoms suggest Polymyalgia Rheumatica.",Polymyalgia Rheumatica,N,"The differential for this patient includes Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), statin-induced myopathy, and myasthenia gravis. The patient's initial symptoms of headaches in her left temple, scalp area, neck stiffness, occasional blurred vision, and jaw pain when chewing are consistent with GCA, which was confirmed with a temporal artery biopsy revealing arteritis. The new symptoms of weakness, difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair, and combing her hair could potentially suggest a progression or complication of her GCA, but it is unlikely given the resolution of her previous symptoms. Myasthenia gravis typically presents with fatigable muscle weakness which worsens with use and improves with rest, but it typically affects eye movements and facial muscles first.

Statin-induced myopathy could potentially cause these symptoms of weakness, but it would typically also cause muscle pain and an elevation of creatine kinase levels, which is not seen in this patient. Therefore, statin-induced myopathy is also less likely.

The patient's symptoms are most consistent with Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR). PMR often co-exists with GCA, and it classically presents with pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips, along with weakness and difficulty performing activities like rising from a chair or combing one's hair. The absence of elevated ESR or creatine kinase levels helps exclude active arteritis or myopathy, further supporting the diagnosis of PMR.",Polymyalgia Rheumatica,N,"This patient initially presented with symptoms of temporal headaches, jaw claudication, vision changes, and neck stiffness, which are suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA), and this was confirmed by biopsy. Her subsequent complaints of proximal muscle weakness without pain or sensory changes, in the setting of normal ESR and creatine kinase, is suggestive of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). PMR and GCA often coexist and can occur in sequence. The resolution of her GCA symptoms is likely due to her treatment which would typically involve glucocorticoids, which is also the initial treatment for PMR. The presentation is not consistent with an ongoing GCA or another form of vasculitis, as the ESR would likely be elevated in those conditions.",Polymyalgia rheumatica,N,"This patient's initial symptoms of headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, and visual symptoms, along with an elevated ESR and a temporal artery biopsy showing arteritis, were highly suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA). However, her new symptoms of symmetric proximal muscle weakness, difficulty rising from a chair, climbing stairs, or lifting her arms above her head, without accompanying muscle pain, suggests a different diagnosis: polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). PMR is often associated with GCA and may develop before, concurrently, or after the diagnosis of GCA. It is characterized by symmetric pain and stiffness primarily involving the shoulders and hips, and often results in difficulty with functions that require these muscles. Normal creatine kinase also suggests this is more of an inflammatory process rather than a muscular injury. Despite the name, myalgias (muscle pain) are not a predominant feature of PMR. The ESR can be normal in treated GCA or PMR, as it might be in this case if the patient was treated for GCA initially.",Polymyalgia Rheumatica,N,"Starting with the prior probability, Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) has a probability of approximately 10% in patients older than 50. Given the patient's symptoms, such as difficulty climbing stairs, rising from a chair, and combing her hair, the probability of PMR increases to around 30%. The symmetric weakness and stiffness, particularly in the proximal muscles (shoulder and hip), are characteristic of PMR, raising the probability to 60%. Moreover, the presence of resolved temporal arteritis (a condition often associated with PMR) in her medical history can increase the likelihood of PMR even further, to around 80%. The normal creatine kinase and ESR levels, although sometimes elevated in PMR, do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis and do not significantly affect the probability.

These symptoms, along with the presence of enlarged lymph nodes in multiple locations (both cervical and axillary), indicate a systemic disease affecting the blood and the lymphatic system.

The critical piece of information missing from the question is what the peripheral blood smear shows. The most likely possibilities include leukemia or lymphoma based on the given symptoms. A peripheral blood smear can show different types of blood cells and abnormalities in these cells. For example, in leukemia, there would be an increased number of immature or abnormal white blood cells. In lymphoma, the smear might show abnormal lymphocytes or other signs of malignancy.

The increase in leukocyte count, along with the constellation of other symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, recurrent infections, and enlarged lymph nodes, could indicate a hematological malignancy. The infections he had could also be a result of his compromised immune system.

Since the question suggests a peripheral blood smear has been done and the patient has significantly high leukocyte count, this increases the suspicion for a type of leukemia. However, the exact type of leukemia (e.g., Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or Chronic Lymphoblastic Leukemia) cannot be definitively determined without information from the blood smear or additional tests like bone marrow biopsy or cytogenetic analysis.",Leukemia,N,"The image is not provided, but based on the information given, the clinical presentation is suggestive of a hematologic malignancy. The man's symptoms include fever, weight loss, fatigue, recurrent infections (pneumonia and urinary tract infection), and splenomegaly, which are collectively referred to as B symptoms and are characteristic of lymphomas. The presence of petechiae and purpura suggest thrombocytopenia, which can occur in hematologic malignancies due to bone marrow involvement. The enlarged lymph nodes in multiple noncontiguous sites also suggest a systemic disease like lymphoma. The peripheral blood smear could further confirm the diagnosis if it shows atypical lymphocytes, which are common in lymphomas. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is lymphoma.",Lymphoma,N,"The patient's history of recurring infections (pneumonia and urinary tract infection) along with the fever could suggest an underlying immunocompromised state or malignancy. The fact that he has lost weight and is experiencing fatigue and dyspnea could also point towards a malignancy or severe chronic illness. The petechiae, purpura, and low platelet count may suggest a bleeding or coagulation disorder, or could be a sign of bone marrow involvement in a disease like leukemia. The enlargement of lymph nodes in multiple areas (cervical and axillary) may indicate a systemic process, possibly lymphoma or leukemia. The elevated leukocyte count could also be a sign of an infection, but in the context of the other symptoms and findings, it is more likely due to a malignancy such as leukemia. The decreased hemoglobin could be due to bone marrow suppression from the malignancy or due to the systemic illness. Unfortunately, without the mentioned Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smear image, it's hard to make a definitive diagnosis, but given the history and blood work, some form of leukemia is a strong possibility.",Leukemia,N,"The prior probability of a leukemia diagnosis for a person of this age might be low, say around 2%.

Firstly, the patient's symptoms include fever, fatigue, and dyspnea, which are often seen in cases of leukemia, thereby increasing the posterior probability to about 15%.

Secondly, the patient has experienced unexplained weight loss, another symptom of leukemia. This increases the probability further to approximately 30%.

Thirdly, the physical exam showed petechiae and purpura, symptoms often associated with thrombocytopenia, which is common in leukemia. This might increase the posterior probability to about 50%.

Finally, the patient's blood test results show both anemia (low hemoglobin) and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), alongside an elevated leukocyte count, all of which are often seen in leukemia patients. This information might increase the posterior probability to about 80%.

The absence of any neurological findings or other symptoms suggesting organic illness further raises the posterior probability of a dissociative disorder to around 70%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient�s symptoms is a dissociative disorder.",Dissociative disorder,N
"A 67-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 1 hour after her husband saw her faint shortly after getting out of bed from a nap. She regained consciousness within 30 seconds and was fully alert and oriented. She has had 2 similar episodes in the last 5 years, once while standing in line at the grocery store and once when getting out of bed in the morning. 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography were unremarkable at her last hospitalization 1 year ago. She has hypertension, depression, and asthma. Current medications include verapamil, nortriptyline, and an albuterol inhaler as needed. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 74/min and regular, respirations are 14/min, blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg when supine and 95/60 mm Hg while standing. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference range. Bedside cardiac monitoring shows rare premature ventricular contractions and T-wave inversions in lead III. What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Autonomic dysfunction,Vasovagal syncope,N,Vasovagal syncope,N,Vasovagal syncope,N,Vasovagal syncope,N,Vasovagal syncope,N,,"The patient's symptoms include fainting (syncope), especially when changing position from lying down to standing up. These symptoms suggest that the patient has orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which blood pressure falls significantly upon standing. This is supported by the decrease in her blood pressure from 114/72 mm Hg when supine to 95/60 mm Hg while standing. Additionally, her current medications include verapamil, which can cause or exacerbate orthostatic hypotension. Her episodes of syncope upon standing, along with the presence of orthostatic hypotension on physical exam, therefore suggest that orthostatic hypotension is the most likely cause of her symptoms.",Orthostatic Hypotension.,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes orthostatic hypotension, vasovagal syncope, cardiac arrhythmias, neurological disorders such as seizures or transient ischemic attacks, and other less common causes such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity. In this case, the patient's history of fainting episodes upon getting up from bed or standing in line, combined with a significant drop in blood pressure from a supine to a standing position, suggest a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. The medication verapamil, which she is taking, can also exacerbate orthostatic hypotension. Though cardiac arrhythmias can cause syncope, the patient's cardiac monitoring only showed rare premature ventricular contractions and T-wave inversions in lead III, which are usually not significant enough to cause syncope. Her other conditions and medications do not clearly contribute to her symptoms, and her remaining examination and tests do not support other differential diagnoses.",Orthostatic hypotension,Y,"The patient's history of episodes of fainting (syncope) associated with positional changes (like getting out of bed or standing in line) suggests a diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension. The finding of a lower blood pressure upon standing further supports this. Orthostatic hypotension is a common side effect of many medications, including those that this patient is taking, such as verapamil, a calcium channel blocker used for hypertension that can cause vasodilation and decrease in blood pressure. Also, nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, can cause orthostatic hypotension by its anticholinergic effects leading to reduced vascular tone.",Orthostatic Hypotension,Y,"The history provided by this 67-year-old woman points towards a possible diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension, a form of low blood pressure that happens when you stand up from sitting or lying down. Given the context, her symptoms (fainting shortly after getting up) and her decrease in blood pressure (from 114/72 mm Hg when supine to 95/60 mm Hg while standing) are consistent with this condition.

Orthostatic hypotension can occur for a variety of reasons, including dehydration, prolonged bed rest, pregnancy, diabetes, heart problems, burns, excessive heat, large varicose veins, and certain neurological disorders. The use of certain medications can also contribute to the condition. In this particular case, the patient's use of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure, could be contributing to her symptoms. Calcium channel blockers can lower the blood pressure, which, especially in combination with the transition from a supine to a standing position, may be enough to cause a syncopal episode.",Orthostatic Hypotension,Y,"The prior probability of neurally mediated syncope (also known as vasovagal syncope) is around 5% in the general population. However, in this patient's case, we have to consider multiple factors. Her history of similar fainting episodes, particularly in situations like standing up from a lying position, increases the posterior probability to about 30%. These situations are known to provoke neurally mediated syncope due to a transient decrease in cerebral perfusion.

The fact that she regained consciousness rapidly, was fully alert and oriented, and had no neurological deficits further raises the probability of neurally mediated syncope to about 50%. These features are typical of this condition.

Her blood pressure shows a significant drop upon standing, which is a common finding in neurally mediated syncope, increasing the likelihood to about 60%. Furthermore, her 24-hour Holter monitoring and echocardiography were unremarkable, which excludes many cardiac causes of syncope and further strengthens the likelihood of neurally mediated syncope to around 80%.

Her medications, specifically verapamil (a calcium channel blocker), may predispose her to episodes of syncope, further increasing the likelihood to around 90%. Finally, the absence of other typical causes of syncope in her blood work and physical examination further reinforces the likelihood of neurally mediated syncope.",Neurally mediated syncope,N

Hyponatremia is seen in advanced cirrhosis due to inability to excrete free water resulting from hypoalbuminemia (which decreases oncotic pressure and leads to ascites) and hyperaldosteronism (which enhances renal water and sodium reabsorption). Moreover, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) with elevated creatinine and low urine output. There is also pre-renal azotemia evidenced by BUN:Creatinine ratio greater than 20:1 (BUN 51 mg/dL and creatinine 2.2 mg/dL). This is likely due to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low effective circulating volume from the ascites seen in cirrhosis.",Pre-renal azotemia,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes dehydration, acute kidney injury, hepatic disease, alcohol toxicity, or heart failure. Let's go through the details:

Dehydration: While this patient has poor hygiene and could be neglecting fluid intake, his laboratory results don't support dehydration as a primary diagnosis. His sodium level is low, which would be unexpected in dehydration as it usually leads to hemoconcentration and elevated sodium levels.

Acute kidney injury (AKI): AKI can occur as a result of various factors such as severe dehydration, drug overdose, or other nephrotoxic insults. His elevated BUN and creatinine, along with the decreased urine output, strongly suggest renal impairment.

Hepatic disease: The patient has known hepatitis C, poor dentition, skin discoloration, and ascites (implied by abdominal distension with a positive fluid wave), suggesting cirrhosis or other significant hepatic disease. However, liver disease primarily impacts the kidneys through hepatorenal syndrome, which typically presents with very low urine sodium (<10 mEq/L), contrary to this patient's results.

Alcohol toxicity: Chronic alcohol misuse can lead to various complications, including liver disease and direct kidney damage. But alcohol-induced kidney damage doesn't usually cause such a severe decline in urine output.

Heart failure: This patient has a murmur and bibasilar crackles, which may suggest heart failure. Heart failure can cause renal impairment through low perfusion. However, heart failure often leads to hyponatremia and a low urine sodium concentration, not aligning with this patient's findings.

Given the patient's elevated BUN and creatinine, reduced urine output, and comparatively higher urine sodium level, his renal findings are most consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). ATN often presents with renal impairment and an inability to concentrate urine, leading to wasted sodium (urine sodium >20 mEq/L). This condition is a common form of AKI and can be caused by a variety of insults, including ischemia (from hypotension, sepsis, or surgery) and nephrotoxic agents (medications, substances of abuse, or contrast dye). This patient's background of IV drug use and possible decreased perfusion from his hepatic disease may have contributed to the development of ATN.",Acute Tubular Necrosis,N,"This patient has symptoms of alcoholism and hepatic disease (e.g., ascites as suggested by abdominal distension with a positive fluid wave, mild jaundice) along with acute kidney injury (AKI) demonstrated by an elevated creatinine level. In this case, the most likely explanation for this patient's renal findings is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). HRS is a type of kidney failure that occurs in people with severe liver problems, particularly in cases of cirrhosis, like it may be implied by this patient's history of alcohol use and hepatitis C. In HRS, the kidneys reduce their function, not due to any direct damage to the kidneys, but as a complicated response to changes in circulation and blood volume caused by liver disease. Despite decreased kidney function, the urine sodium is very low (<10 mEq/L) because the kidneys are avidly retaining sodium in response to decreased effective circulating volume.",Hepatorenal syndrome,Y,"The patient in the presented case has signs of chronic liver disease, possibly cirrhosis, due to his history of alcohol use, IV drug use, and hepatitis C. His physical exam findings of abdominal distension, positive fluid wave (suggestive of ascites), and jaundice align with this. The renal findings suggest a low urine output with normal electrolytes, and a high Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) to Creatinine ratio. This clinical picture is consistent with hepatorenal syndrome, a type of kidney failure seen in advanced liver disease. In hepatorenal syndrome, splanchnic vasodilation (due to portal hypertension in liver disease) leads to decreased effective circulating blood volume, which triggers activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This leads to renal vasoconstriction and decreased renal blood flow, culminating in low urine output and renal failure, despite the kidney itself being structurally normal.",Hepatorenal syndrome,Y,"This patient presents with symptoms of an acute kidney injury (AKI) given the elevated creatinine and decreased urine output. The Bayesian inference begins with assigning a prior probability to different causes of AKI. In this context, the common causes are pre-renal (from hypoperfusion), intrinsic renal (from damage to the kidney parenchyma), and post-renal (from obstruction).

Let's assign these initial prior probabilities:

Pre-renal: 60%
Intrinsic renal: 30%
Post-renal: 10%
We first evaluate for pre-renal causes. These are usually associated with conditions that decrease effective circulating volume such as hypovolemia (e.g. due to bleeding or dehydration) or heart failure. The patient's blood pressure normalized after fluid resuscitation, which lowers the probability of hypovolemia causing AKI. His cardiac exam is notable only for a murmur and no signs of congestive heart failure are mentioned, making heart failure less likely as well. Thus, let's lower the posterior probability of pre-renal causes to 40%.

Next, we evaluate intrinsic renal causes. These include acute tubular necrosis, interstitial nephritis, and glomerulonephritis. There's no history of nephrotoxic drug use, recent contrast administration, or signs of an allergic or autoimmune reaction. Thus, the posterior probability of intrinsic renal causes can be reduced to 10%.

Finally, we consider post-renal causes. These are typically due to an obstruction to urinary flow and can cause AKI if bilateral or in a single kidney patient. This patient has no symptoms of obstruction like flank pain or a history of nephrolithiasis or prostate hypertrophy. However, there's no clear cause for AKI in this patient yet, so we increase the posterior probability of post-renal causes to 50%.

Since the AKI's cause remains unclear, further diagnostic testing is warranted. In particular, a renal ultrasound could help to identify or rule out post-renal causes.","Unclear, further investigation needed.",N

These symptoms are consistent with an advanced stage of breast cancer known as inflammatory breast cancer. This type of breast cancer presents with skin changes that resemble inflammation (like infection), such as erythema (redness), edema (swelling), and warmth, hence its name.

Her presentation aligns with inflammatory breast cancer, a relatively rare and very aggressive disease in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The 'peau d'orange' (resembling the peel of an orange) appearance due to skin edema is characteristic. A history of a first-degree relative with breast cancer further increases her risk. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is inflammatory breast cancer.",Inflammatory Breast Cancer,Y,"The prior probability of inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) in the general population is relatively low, estimated at about 1-5% of all breast cancers. However, in this case, the presentation with left breast enlargement, erythema, and edema increases the posterior probability of IBC.

The presence of a breast lump the patient noted a year ago increases the probability further. The lump, coupled with the inflammatory symptoms, significantly increases the likelihood of IBC, let's say to around 20%.

Next, the patient's family history of breast cancer, specifically her mother dying from the disease at a relatively young age, provides a genetic predisposition, which further increases the probability of IBC to around 40%.

Additionally, the patient's symptoms have persisted over two months, which is consistent with the insidious nature of IBC. The persistent symptoms and their duration increase the probability to around 60%.

Finally, the physical exam findings of erythema, edematous skin plaques over a breast mass, tenderness, and axillary lymphadenopathy are all clinical indicators of IBC. These findings increase the posterior probability to over 80%.

When talking to the patient, it is discovered that she mostly avoids the kids in school because of fear of rejection. She usually keeps to herself and says she hasn’t involved herself in any group activities since elementary school. The patient’s mother is worried that this kind of behavior might continue or worsen if it progresses into her college years. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Avoidant personality disorder,Social anxiety disorder,N,Social anxiety disorder,N,Social anxiety disorder.,N,Social Anxiety Disorder,N,Social anxiety disorder,N,,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl whose main issue appears to be a fear of rejection, leading to avoidance of social situations. She does not engage in group activities and prefers to keep to herself. This behavior extends back to her childhood, which suggests a longstanding pattern rather than a new or temporary issue. While feelings of unattractiveness and not fitting in may be associated with depressive disorders, the primary issue here seems to be her avoidance of social situations due to a fear of rejection, which points towards a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder.",Avoidant personality disorder,Y,"The differential for this patient includes depression, social anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, and avoidant personality disorder.
Depression might include symptoms such as sadness, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, etc., which are not specifically mentioned in this scenario.
Body dysmorphic disorder typically involves obsessive focus on perceived flaws in physical appearance, which is also not clearly specified here.
Social anxiety disorder, while potentially applicable, generally centers around fear of specific social situations due to fear of embarrassment or judgment, rather than generalized avoidance of social interaction.
On the other hand, avoidant personality disorder is characterized by patterns of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, leading to avoidance of social interactions. Given the chronic nature of this patient's behavior (since elementary school) and her avoidance due to fear of rejection, avoidant personality disorder is the most likely diagnosis.",Avoidant personality disorder,Y,"The patient is a 17-year-old girl who is exhibiting avoidance behavior due to fear of rejection, which is a common symptom of Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD).

Depressive disorders do not typically include fear of rejection or avoidance of social situations as prominent features.",Avoidant Personality Disorder,Y,"The prior probability of Avoidant Personality Disorder in the general population is about 2.4%. However, the girl's described behaviour presents significant symptoms that are suggestive of this disorder. The fear of rejection and avoidance of social interactions increases the likelihood of this disorder to around 30%. Furthermore, her history of long-term avoidance behaviour (since elementary school) suggests a chronic pattern, which is typical for personality disorders, increasing the probability to 60%.

A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of altered mental status for 2 hours. She and her husband were at the grocery store when she suddenly could not remember why she was there or how she got there. She has not had any head trauma. She has a history of depression and migraines. She does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine each night with dinner. She takes fluoxetine daily. She appears distressed and anxious. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is fully alert and oriented to self and place but not to time. Every few minutes she asks how she got to the emergency department. She is able to follow commands and sustain attention. She recalls 3/3 objects immediately and recalls 0/3 objects at 5 minutes. The remainder of the neurological exam shows no abnormalities.

These symptoms suggest an impairment of her short-term memory, which is a key feature of a condition known as transient global amnesia. This condition is typically sudden in onset, as in this case, and is often precipitated by physically or emotionally stressful events. Notably, transient global amnesia does not typically affect personal identity or cause other neurologic deficits, which is consistent with the findings of this woman's neurological exam. The condition is also more common in individuals between the ages of 50 and 70, which aligns with this woman's age.",Transient global amnesia,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, delirium, dementia, or psychiatric conditions like severe depression or anxiety. Given her normal vital signs and lack of neurological deficits (other than her memory issue), a stroke or TIA seems less likely. Delirium typically involves fluctuating levels of consciousness and inattention, which she does not exhibit. Severe depression and anxiety could cause concentration problems but wouldn't typically result in acute memory loss. Her memory problem is specific to her inability to recall recent events, suggesting an issue with her short-term memory, which is characteristic of a condition called transient global amnesia (TGA). TGA is a sudden, temporary episode of memory loss that can't be attributed to a more common neurological condition, such as epilepsy or stroke.

"A 74-year-old man returns to his physician to follow-up on laboratory studies obtained for anemia 2 weeks ago. He has no complaints. He has a 20-year history of hypertension and several years of knee osteoarthritis. He walks 2 miles a day. He does not smoke. He drinks alcohol moderately. He takes hydrochlorothiazide, losartan, and pain killers, including ibuprofen. The vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse 68/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. The laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 10 g/dL

Monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis is 12 g/L (non-IgM). Clonal bone marrow plasma cells comprise 4% of the total number of cells. Skeletal survey with magnetic resonance imaging reveals no pathologic findings. In addition to iron deficiency anemia, what diagnosis is most appropriate to consider?",Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance,Multiple myeloma,N,Multiple myeloma,N,Multiple myeloma,N,Multiple myeloma,N,Multiple myeloma,N,,"This patient presents with a few key findings. He has a low hemoglobin level, which is indicative of anemia. Moreover, the low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) suggests that this anemia is microcytic. Additionally, the low iron and ferritin levels with a high total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) further confirm that the anemia is due to iron deficiency, likely as a result of the chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and therefore iron loss.

However, another key finding in this patient's labs is the presence of monoclonal protein in the serum and clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. These findings are suggestive of a plasma cell dyscrasia, which encompasses a group of disorders that result from the clonal proliferation of plasma cells. The most common of these is multiple myeloma, but the absence of other characteristic signs of this condition (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions), referred to as the ""CRAB"" criteria, and the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells being less than 10% makes this diagnosis less likely.

In this context, the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) should be considered. MGUS is a condition characterized by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein (M protein) but no symptoms or signs of multiple myeloma or related diseases. The presence of a serum M protein and a clonal plasma cell population, as is seen in this patient, is consistent with this diagnosis.",Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS),Y,"The differential diagnoses for this patient with anemia include iron deficiency anemia, anemia of chronic disease, myelodysplastic syndrome, and multiple myeloma.

The patient's symptoms and lab findings such as low hemoglobin, low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and low serum ferritin point towards iron deficiency anemia. In addition, his regular use of ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, could contribute to gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequent iron deficiency anemia.

Regarding multiple myeloma, the presence of a monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis is suspicious. However, the presence of monoclonal protein does not automatically imply multiple myeloma, as there are other conditions that can lead to the presence of these proteins such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is a condition in which a monoclonal protein is present in the blood, but the other criteria for diagnosing multiple myeloma (e.g., high percentage of clonal plasma cells in bone marrow, signs of end-organ damage) are not met. In this patient, the number of clonal bone marrow plasma cells is relatively low (4%) and there are no skeletal pathologic findings, which makes multiple myeloma less likely.

Overall, given the patient's history, the presence of a monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis, and the absence of criteria supporting a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, it is more reasonable to consider a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) along with iron deficiency anemia.",Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS),Y,"This patient has a normocytic anemia with low iron, low ferritin, and high total iron-binding capacity, which are indicative of iron deficiency anemia. A common cause of iron deficiency anemia in an elderly man is chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, which could be secondary to his regular use of ibuprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) known to potentially cause gastric ulcers and bleeding. Furthermore, the presence of a monoclonal protein in serum and clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow suggest a plasma cell dyscrasia. Although these findings could suggest multiple myeloma, the absence of end-organ damage (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, or bone lesions - often remembered as the acronym CRAB) as well as the low percentage of bone marrow plasma cells (less than 10%) makes this diagnosis unlikely. Instead, these findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is a precursor state that may eventually lead to multiple myeloma or other diseases, but may also remain stable and asymptomatic for many years.",Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS),Y,"The patient has anemia with microcytosis (low Mean Corpuscular Volume), and low serum iron and ferritin with high Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC), which is indicative of iron deficiency anemia, likely secondary to chronic blood loss. Chronic use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding leading to iron deficiency anemia. However, this patient also has a significant amount of monoclonal protein on serum electrophoresis and clonal bone marrow plasma cells. These findings are suggestive of a monoclonal gammopathy, specifically Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) because plasma cells are less than 10% of the bone marrow, and there is no evidence of end organ damage (no lytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal insufficiency that could be attributed to a plasma cell dyscrasia). Therefore, this patient likely has iron deficiency anemia due to NSAID use and MGUS.",Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS),Y,"The prior probability of multiple myeloma in an elderly patient might be relatively low, say around 1%. The presence of anemia with low MCV (mean corpuscular volume) increases the probability of iron deficiency, but not necessarily multiple myeloma. However, considering the patient's age and the presence of monoclonal protein in serum electrophoresis, the posterior probability of multiple myeloma increases, say to about 10%. The presence of clonal bone marrow plasma cells, although only 4%, further raises the probability to 20%. Notably, the absence of pathological findings in a skeletal survey with MRI does not rule out multiple myeloma, as these may not be present in the early stages of the disease. Therefore, while iron deficiency anemia is clear in this case, the additional diagnosis of multiple myeloma is also likely and should be investigated further.",Multiple myeloma,N

However, his liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are normal, which typically would not be the case in hepatocellular diseases such as hepatitis. His Anti-HAV IgG positive result indicates past exposure to Hepatitis A, but it is not the cause of his current symptoms as this form of hepatitis does not cause chronic or recurring symptoms. His positive Anti-HBsAg suggests that he's either vaccinated or has recovered from Hepatitis B. He is also negative for HCV RNA, ruling out Hepatitis C. His urine test results show presence of bilirubin, which usually suggests that the bilirubin is conjugated, since only conjugated bilirubin can be excreted in the urine. His direct (conjugated) bilirubin is elevated, while his indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin is normal. These findings together suggest a post-hepatic cause, specifically a disorder causing a disruption of the excretion of bilirubin after it has been processed by the liver, since the liver itself appears to be functioning properly. The most likely cause of this patient's recurrent jaundice given his age and the lab findings is Dubin-Johnson syndrome, an inherited form of chronic jaundice that does not typically affect overall health and lifespan, but causes an intermittent increase in direct bilirubin due to a defect in the protein responsible for transporting conjugated bilirubin into the bile canaliculi from hepatocytes.",Dubin-Johnson syndrome,N,"The differential for this patient includes Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Gilbert's Syndrome, Hemolytic Anemia, Cholelithiasis, and Drug-induced Hepatitis.

The anti-HAV IgG positive test indicates past infection or immunization to Hepatitis A, but his liver function tests like AST and ALT are normal, ruling out active hepatitis. The urine studies show the presence of bilirubin but normal urobilinogen, which indicates that bilirubin is being processed normally by the liver. This, along with the fact that his episodes of jaundice are recurrent and self-resolving, points towards Gilbert's Syndrome, a benign condition where the liver has trouble processing bilirubin, leading to occasional jaundice.",Gilbert's Syndrome,N,"This patient's periodic episodes of jaundice, which typically last 1-2 weeks and then resolve, combined with the laboratory findings are suggestive of acute hepatitis, specifically Hepatitis A (HAV). The HAV IgG positive result indicates past or current infection with HAV. It's important to note that his history of recent travel to Mexico, a country where Hepatitis A is relatively common, and his inconsistent use of protection during sexual encounters, another potential transmission route, make this diagnosis even more likely. The presence of bilirubin in urine, which is excreted when the liver is damaged, and normal AST and ALT (which would be elevated in chronic hepatitis) are also consistent with an acute hepatitis process.",Hepatitis A,N,"This young man's intermittent jaundice, in the absence of hepatomegaly or other signs of liver disease, points toward a disorder of bilirubin metabolism rather than active liver disease or obstruction. The lab findings indicate a predominance of direct (conjugated) bilirubin, which is excreted in the urine and is responsible for the jaundice and the urinary bilirubin. The lack of abnormal liver enzymes (AST, ALT) and normal alkaline phosphatase levels also argue against active liver disease or biliary obstruction. The positive Anti-HAV IgG and Anti-HBsAg suggest past exposure to Hepatitis A and B, but immunity, not active infection. In addition, negative HCV RNA suggests no active Hepatitis C infection. Given this information, the most likely diagnosis is a benign cause of recurrent jaundice known as Gilbert syndrome, a common inherited condition characterized by mild, episodic unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to reduced hepatic uptake or conjugation of bilirubin.",Gilbert syndrome,N,"This is a case of recurrent jaundice in a young adult. Given that the man has normal AST and ALT levels and no other signs or symptoms of acute liver disease, it's unlikely to be hepatitis.

Now, starting with our priors:

The prior probability of Gilbert's Syndrome, a genetic disorder that impairs bilirubin conjugation in the liver and often presents with benign, recurrent jaundice in young adulthood, might be 5%.
However, seeing a total bilirubin of 4.0 mg/dL and direct bilirubin of 3.0 mg/dL in the context of normal liver enzymes increases the likelihood of Gilbert's Syndrome, as unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a hallmark of the condition. This might increase the posterior probability to 20%.
The presence of bilirubin in the urine suggests that the bilirubin is being processed in the liver (i.e., it's been conjugated), further increasing the likelihood of Gilbert's Syndrome and possibly raising the posterior probability to 35%.
The absence of hepatomegaly or any other abnormal physical examination findings and the absence of history of serious illness in the family might increase the probability to 50%.
Given the sporadic, self-resolving nature of the jaundice, which aligns with the typical presentation of Gilbert's Syndrome, the posterior probability might increase further to 60% or more.
Finally, the absence of any significant risk factors for liver disease (no alcohol or illicit drug use, negative HCV RNA, no travel history to areas with endemic liver diseases) might increase the posterior probability to 70% or more.
Thus, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is Gilbert's Syndrome.",Gilbert's Syndrome,N

Oropharyngeal dysphagia is often associated with neurological disorders, which he does not seem to have. GERD typically presents with heartburn and regurgitation, which he does not report. Esophageal strictures tend to cause progressive dysphagia, first with solids then with liquids, but typically over a shorter period.

What is the most likely cause of this patient’s acute renal failure?",Dehydration,Prerenal acute renal failure,Y,Dehydration,Y,Prerenal azotemia,Y,Pre-renal azotemia,Y,Dehydration,Y,,"This patient presents with a history of confusion, dry mucous membranes, and skin tenting, all of which suggest dehydration. Dehydration, especially when prolonged, can result in pre-renal acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypovolemia, which reduces renal blood flow. The increased BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) to creatinine ratio (greater than 20:1) is also indicative of pre-renal etiologies of AKI, such as dehydration. Normally, when kidney function is impaired due to intrinsic renal diseases, BUN and creatinine increase proportionately, but in pre-renal causes, the renal tubules reabsorb more urea due to the low flow state, causing a disproportionate increase in BUN. The patient's normal urine sodium and creatinine also fit with this diagnosis; with pre-renal azotemia, the kidneys should still be able to concentrate the urine and reabsorb sodium effectively, which is the case here.",Dehydration-induced pre-renal AKI,Y,"In assessing this patient's condition, the differential diagnosis for acute kidney injury (AKI) includes pre-renal azotemia, intrinsic renal disease, and post-renal obstruction. Key indicators in this situation are the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results.

The history of probable decreased fluid intake, medications like hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic), and signs of dehydration on physical examination (dry mucous membranes and skin tenting) suggest a pre-renal cause. Pre-renal azotemia, or kidney dysfunction due to inadequate perfusion, is most likely in this context.

The lab results also point to a pre-renal cause. In pre-renal azotemia, the Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) to Creatinine ratio is often above 20:1. In this case, the BUN is 40 mg/dL and the Creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, giving a ratio of about 29:1, which is suggestive of pre-renal azotemia. This occurs because of increased reabsorption of BUN in the proximal tubule when renal perfusion decreases.

Additionally, urine sodium would usually be low in pre-renal azotemia due to enhanced sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule due to the low perfusion. However, this patient's urine sodium is normal, likely because the thiazide diuretic he takes inhibits sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, which would result in a higher urine sodium.

Intrinsic renal disease could cause a similar picture but is less likely given the lack of history of nephrotoxins or glomerulonephritis and absence of urinary sediments. Post-renal causes (e.g., obstruction) are less likely in the absence of symptoms or history suggesting obstruction (e.g., difficulty urinating, known kidney stones).

Hence, this patient's AKI is likely due to dehydration leading to pre-renal azotemia.",Dehydration-induced pre-renal azotemia.,Y,"The patient's presentation with confusion, dry mucus membranes, skin tenting, an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio (approximately 29), and a history of being alone without adequate water intake for several days strongly suggests prerenal azotemia. Prerenal azotemia is a form of acute kidney injury that is usually due to decreased renal perfusion, often secondary to dehydration, in this case likely due to inadequate fluid intake. In prerenal azotemia, the kidney function may be impaired, leading to decreased excretion of waste products like BUN and creatinine, hence the elevated levels in blood. The high BUN to creatinine ratio (usually greater than 20 in prerenal azotemia) is indicative of a state where the kidney is trying to conserve water, leading to increased reabsorption of BUN and hence a proportionally greater increase in BUN compared to creatinine.",Dehydration-induced prerenal azotemia.,Y,"The patient's presentation and lab findings suggest dehydration, which is likely a result of inadequate fluid intake during the time he was alone. Symptoms such as altered mental status, dry mucus membranes, and skin tenting are consistent with severe dehydration. His lab results show elevated BUN and Creatinine levels, indicative of acute kidney injury (AKI). In dehydration, there's an increase in antidiuretic hormone (ADH) that leads to water reabsorption in the collecting ducts and increased urea reabsorption. This would result in an increased BUN:Creatinine ratio, often greater than 20:1, which seems consistent with this patient's lab results. Given this, the most likely cause of this patient's acute renal failure is prerenal azotemia due to severe dehydration.",Dehydration-induced prerenal azotemia.,Y,"The starting point (prior probability) of pre-renal azotemia (i.e. decreased kidney blood flow leading to acute kidney injury) in an elderly patient presenting with acute renal failure can be estimated at around 60%. Pre-renal azotemia is usually due to dehydration, heart failure, or decreased blood volume, among other causes.

The patient's presentation of altered mental status, dry mucus membranes, and skin tenting is suggestive of dehydration, which increases the posterior probability of pre-renal azotemia to around 70%.

The lab findings show an elevated BUN (blood urea nitrogen) of 40 mg/dL and creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, consistent with kidney dysfunction, but the BUN to creatinine ratio is greater than 20:1, which is a classic finding in pre-renal azotemia due to increased reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubules when there is low renal perfusion. This increases the probability of pre-renal azotemia to 85%.

The 24-hour urine collection shows a high urine sodium concentration, which at first glance might seem to support intrinsic renal disease, but remember the patient is taking hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that increases sodium excretion in urine. Therefore, it doesn't significantly change the high probability of pre-renal azotemia.

Overall, given the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of his acute renal failure is pre-renal azotemia, likely due to dehydration from being alone without adequate fluid intake for several days.",Dehydration-induced pre-renal azotemia.,Y

What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",Multiple myeloma,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,,"This 71-year-old woman presents with progressive shortness of breath, swollen legs, disturbed sleep due to a choking sensation, jugular venous distention, and pitting edema below the knees. These symptoms together indicate a condition of congestive heart failure. The crackles heard at both lung bases is indicative of pulmonary edema, which is a common feature in congestive heart failure. The low-voltage QRS complexes and symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy seen on EKG and echocardiography respectively, as well as reduced diastolic filling but preserved ejection fraction suggest restrictive cardiomyopathy.

Considering her recent travel history to Tanzania, her chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and her symptoms and clinical presentation, one possible explanation for her restrictive cardiomyopathy could be amyloidosis. Amyloidosis can occur secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions, and may be related to her sister's polymyalgia rheumatica (an inflammatory condition), though the link is not straightforward. The ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) which is elevated, suggests an ongoing systemic inflammation or chronic disease. Her low hemoglobin concentration could be due to anemia secondary to a chronic disease or due to the amyloidosis itself. It should also be noted that amyloidosis is more prevalent in certain parts of Africa, which fits with her recent safari tour in Tanzania.",Amyloidosis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, amyloidosis, or lung cancer.

The symptoms of progressive shortness of breath, swollen legs, and nocturnal dyspnea along with physical findings of pitting edema below the knees, jugular venous distention and crackles at both lung bases suggest a diagnosis of heart failure. However, her ECG shows low-voltage QRS complexes, and the echocardiography demonstrates symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced diastolic filling but a normal ejection fraction. These are characteristic features of cardiac amyloidosis, a form of restrictive cardiomyopathy.

The reduced diastolic filling is a result of the rigid ventricular walls that restrict the filling of the heart during diastole. Low voltage QRS complexes occur due to the infiltration of the myocardium with amyloid protein. Symmetrical hypertrophy of the ventricles is seen due to the deposition of amyloid in the myocardium, which increases the thickness of the heart muscle. This does not signify functional hypertrophy (as in hypertension or aortic stenosis), so despite hypertrophy, the ejection fraction may remain normal.

The slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) could suggest an underlying chronic disease such as amyloidosis. This condition could also explain her anemia (hemoglobin 10 g/dL), which might be due to the kidney involvement in systemic amyloidosis causing renal failure and decreased erythropoiesis.

In addition, amyloidosis can cause a characteristic macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue), but without the photograph mentioned in the question, we can't validate this feature.

Given these considerations, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cardiac amyloidosis.",Cardiac Amyloidosis,Y,"The patient is presenting with symptoms of congestive heart failure, characterized by progressive shortness of breath, swollen legs, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up from a choking sensation). The presence of pitting edema below the knees, jugular venous distention, and crackles in the lungs are all consistent with fluid overload often seen in heart failure. Low-voltage QRS complexes on ECG and symptoms such as dyspnea, edema, and an echocardiogram showing symmetrical left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced diastolic filling while preserving systolic function (ejection fraction of 55%) suggest a restrictive pattern of heart disease. This pattern can be seen in conditions such as cardiac amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of insoluble abnormal protein fibrils that alter the normal function of tissues. The presence of an enlarged tongue in the patient (though not explicitly stated, it is hinted by the mention of a photograph of her tongue) is also a common finding in amyloidosis.",Cardiac Amyloidosis,Y,"This patient's clinical picture indicates heart failure with symptoms of orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying flat), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up from sleep with a sensation of choking), and bilateral crackles in her lungs, which are indicative of pulmonary edema. She also has jugular venous distention and peripheral edema, which are signs of right-sided heart failure. The low-voltage QRS complexes on ECG and the echocardiogram findings of symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with reduced diastolic filling but preserved ejection fraction, suggest a restrictive process. These findings together with the description of her tongue, her recent travel history to Africa and the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate point towards amyloidosis, which can be primary (AL amyloidosis) or secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions. AL amyloidosis can involve the heart leading to a restrictive cardiomyopathy causing these symptoms. Amyloid deposition in the myocardium increases the ventricular wall thickness and reduces ventricular compliance, resulting in diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, this patient's heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and the accompanying symptoms are likely due to cardiac amyloidosis.",Cardiac amyloidosis,Y,"The prior probability of cardiac amyloidosis in a general population is low, let's say 1%. However, several features in this case significantly increase the posterior probability. First, the patient presents with symptoms of heart failure (e.g., shortness of breath, swollen legs, nocturnal coughing), which increases the probability to 20%. Next, the echocardiogram showing symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced diastolic filling, and preserved ejection fraction is suggestive of a restrictive cardiomyopathy such as amyloidosis, which raises the probability to 50%. Further, the finding of low-voltage QRS complexes on ECG, in the context of left ventricular hypertrophy on echocardiogram, suggests infiltrative heart disease, including cardiac amyloidosis, raising the probability further to 70%. Also, her elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate may hint at an underlying systemic inflammatory or infiltrative process, which nudges the probability to 75%. Although not explicitly stated, if the photograph of her tongue showed macroglossia (an enlarged tongue), it would be a common finding in systemic amyloidosis, which could raise the probability further to 85%. Hence, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cardiac amyloidosis.",Cardiac Amyloidosis,Y
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a progressive swelling in her mouth that she first noticed 5 years ago. Initially, the swelling was asymptomatic but has now caused some difficulty while chewing food for the past month. She has no pain. She has not undergone any dental procedures in the past 5 years. She has bronchial asthma. Her only medication is an albuterol inhaler. She appears healthy. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a 1.5-cm smooth, unilobular, bony hard, nontender mass in the midline of the hard palate. There is no cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy.

This growth is described as a smooth, unilobular, bony hard, non-tender mass in the midline of the hard palate. The lesion's hard and bony characteristics along with its slow growth over several years suggest a benign process. Furthermore, the location of the lesion in the midline of the hard palate is consistent with a torus palatinus. Torus palatinus is a benign bony exostosis that is often observed in the midline of the hard palate and is generally not associated with any symptoms unless it becomes large enough to interfere with normal oral function, as in this patient's case where she has difficulty chewing.",Torus Palatinus.,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's oral swelling includes: benign salivary gland tumor, oral cancer, fibroma, and torus palatinus. The swelling is progressive, hard, midline, asymptomatic, and has been present for several years, which makes malignant conditions less likely. Fibromas tend to be soft, not hard, and usually are not located in the midline. Salivary gland tumors usually present near the salivary glands, which are not typically located in the midline of the hard palate.

Torus palatinus, on the other hand, is a benign bony protuberance in the midline of the hard palate, often noticed incidentally or due to difficulty with dentures, orthodontic appliances or during routine dental procedures. It can increase in size with age, usually presents with a hard mass in the midline of the hard palate and it's not associated with pain or other symptoms unless irritated. These characteristics align with the patient's presentation, making it the most likely diagnosis.",Torus palatinus.,Y,"This patient's symptoms - a slowly growing, asymptomatic, bony-hard, midline palatal mass - are suggestive of a Torus Palatinus. This is a benign, often midline, bony exostosis of the hard palate. It is more commonly seen in females and is often asymptomatic unless it grows large enough to interfere with eating, speaking, or fitting of dental prostheses. The mass is typically unilobular and nontender, as in this case. Furthermore, the lack of any associated pain, cervical or submandibular lymphadenopathy makes malignant conditions less likely.",Torus Palatinus,Y,"This patient's history of a slowly progressing, hard, painless mass in the midline of the hard palate is suggestive of a torus palatinus. This is a benign bony overgrowth or protuberance on the hard palate, often seen in middle-aged patients. Tori are usually asymptomatic but can cause difficulty in chewing or fitting dental prosthetics when they become large. Their cause is unknown but may have a genetic basis or may be influenced by environmental factors such as bruxism. The fact that the patient has not undergone any dental procedures recently reduces the likelihood of this being an abscess or other post-procedure complication. Also, it is important to rule out malignancies, but the slow progression, asymptomatic nature, and lack of lymphadenopathy make cancer less likely.",Torus Palatinus,Y,"The prior probability of torus palatinus is approximately 20%. Given that the patient has a bony hard, nontender mass in the midline of the hard palate, this would increase the probability of torus palatinus to around 60%. Furthermore, the fact that this mass is smooth and unilobular supports this diagnosis, raising the probability to 80%. Finally, the long duration of growth with no pain or associated lymphadenopathy and no history of dental procedures further supports this diagnosis, increasing the probability to approximately 90%. This patient most likely has torus palatinus.",Torus palatinus,Y

Given his description of dry, scaly lesions on his elbows that are itchy and prone to bleeding, along with the presentation of the image (which isn't provided here but I'll assume it is consistent with the described symptoms), his condition appears to resemble psoriasis. HIV-infected patients are known to have an increased prevalence of several skin disorders, including psoriasis. The chronic immunosuppression due to HIV can lead to an increase in the incidence and severity of psoriasis.",Psoriasis,Y,"Given that the question didn't provide any image, we'll have to go on the description alone. The differential for this patient includes psoriasis, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and cutaneous manifestations of HIV such as Kaposi's sarcoma and disseminated fungal infections. However, the presence of dry, scaly lesions on elbows which are pruritic and tend to bleed when scratched are characteristic of psoriasis. While HIV can predispose to psoriasis and make it harder to manage, the presence of these lesions, particularly on the elbows (a common site for psoriasis), strongly suggests psoriasis, regardless of HIV status. The normal CD4+ T-lymphocyte count also suggests that the patient's HIV is well-managed, making opportunistic infections less likely.",Psoriasis,Y,"The patient's presentation of dry, scaly, itchy, and bleeding lesions on his elbows that have increased in size over time in the context of HIV infection are suggestive of psoriasis. HIV infection is known to trigger or exacerbate psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition. Smoking, which the patient has a history of, is also known to worsen psoriasis. Psoriasis is often seen in people with a compromised immune system, such as those with HIV. Thus, in the context of this patient's medical history, his skin findings are most likely due to psoriasis.",Psoriasis,Y,"This patient's history of HIV infection and the clinical presentation of dry, scaly, itchy lesions on the elbows that bleed on scratching suggest the diagnosis of psoriasis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune skin condition that is characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes, leading to the formation of these characteristic plaques. Psoriasis can occur in the setting of HIV infection due to the dysregulation of the immune system that occurs with the virus. The CD4+ count of 470/mm3, although slightly below normal, indicates that the patient's immune system is functioning relatively well with the antiretroviral therapy, but the dysregulation of the immune response can still be enough to precipitate the onset of autoimmune conditions such as psoriasis.",Psoriasis,Y,"The prior probability of Psoriasis, a common skin condition causing scaly patches, especially on elbows, in the general population is around 2-3%. The patient has HIV which increases the risk of psoriasis, boosting the posterior probability to around 10%. He also has a history of smoking which can trigger psoriasis, further pushing the probability to around 20%. The fact that the lesions are dry, scaly, and occur on the elbows, which is a typical presentation for psoriasis, and the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which is near the lower end of normal, increases the probability of psoriasis to 40%. Itchy lesions which bleed when scratched, known as the Auspitz sign, is a characteristic feature of psoriasis, pushing the probability to approximately 60%.

"A 22-year-old man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient states that he has had right lower quadrant abdominal pain for ""a while now"". The pain comes and goes, and today it is particularly painful. The patient is a college student studying philosophy. He drinks alcohol occasionally and is currently sexually active. He states that sometimes he feels anxious about school. The patient's father died of colon cancer at the age of 55, and his mother died of breast cancer when she was 57.

Abdominal exam reveals diffuse tenderness. A fecal occult blood test is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Inflammatory bowel syndrome,Inflammatory bowel disease,Y,Colorectal cancer,N,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Y,Colon cancer,N,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Y,,"This 22-year-old patient is presenting with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and positive fecal occult blood test, which suggests a disease involving the gastrointestinal tract. Given his relatively young age, and the episodic nature of the pain, common conditions to consider would include appendicitis, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis.

However, appendicitis typically presents as acute severe pain that does not typically come and go, and doesn't usually cause bloody diarrhea. His family history of colon cancer at a relatively young age could point towards a hereditary condition like familial adenomatous polyposis, but this usually presents with hundreds to thousands of polyps, typically in the second decade of life, and the presentation doesn't exactly fit.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and can cause these symptoms. Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus and usually affects it in a ""skip"" pattern, with areas of disease separated by healthy tissue. It can cause right lower quadrant pain if the terminal ileum is involved. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, only affects the colon and rectum, and it does so in a continuous manner starting from the rectum.

Given the patient's symptoms, family history, and age, Crohn's disease seems like the most likely diagnosis. The family history of colon and breast cancer may be relevant as there is a slight increase in the risk of colorectal cancer in people with IBD, especially those with a family history of such cancers.",Crohn's Disease,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBD), ischemic colitis, gastrointestinal malignancy, or infectious gastroenteritis. Given the patient's presentation with right lower quadrant pain, recurrent bloody diarrhea, positive fecal occult blood test, and a family history of colon cancer, this is more suggestive of an inflammatory process rather than a simple appendicitis or IBS, which typically do not present with bloody diarrhea. Ischemic colitis typically presents in older patients with vascular disease. Infectious gastroenteritis can present with bloody diarrhea, but it is typically acute and self-limited, not recurrent. While gastrointestinal malignancy is a consideration given his family history, it is less likely in a 22-year-old. IBD (either Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis) fits the patient's symptomatology best, as these conditions are chronic, can cause recurrent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and can present in young adults. Between Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis, the patient's pain location in the right lower quadrant, which is where the terminal ileum is located, makes Crohn's disease the most likely diagnosis.",Crohn's disease,Y,"The patient presents with recurring right lower quadrant abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a positive fecal occult blood test. These symptoms suggest an inflammatory process in the bowel. The history of cancer in the family, although of different types, could indicate a genetic predisposition to cancers, but the patient's age and symptoms are more consistent with an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease often presents with intermittent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, and commonly affects the ileum, which is in the right lower quadrant. The presence of anxiety and depression are also more common in patients with Crohn's disease.",Crohn's disease,Y,"This patient presents with recurrent abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a family history of colon and breast cancer. He's also young, which can be indicative of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease or Ulcerative Colitis. The right lower quadrant pain, occasional bloody diarrhea, and positive fecal occult blood test suggest an inflammatory process in the gut. Crohn's disease could fit the clinical picture, but it usually presents with non-bloody diarrhea. On the other hand, Ulcerative colitis usually presents with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain. Although he has a family history of colon cancer, his symptoms are more likely due to inflammation rather than malignancy given his young age and the chronic, intermittent nature of his symptoms. Thus, this patient most likely has Ulcerative Colitis.",Ulcerative Colitis,Y,"The prior probability of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis in the general population is around 0.5%. Given the patient's history of recurrent right lower quadrant abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, this would increase the posterior probability to about 15%. A positive fecal occult blood test could raise this probability further to around 25%. The presence of anxiety and depression, often associated with IBD, might increase the posterior probability to about 35%. Finally, a family history of colon cancer, which can be associated with chronic inflammation of the colon, would increase the probability to approximately 50%.

This sudden drop in hormone levels often leads to symptoms of menopause, which may include decreased sexual desire. However, it is also important to note her psychosocial stressors, including recent arguments due to financial issues and difficulty sleeping. Both stress and poor sleep can contribute to a decrease in sexual desire. Furthermore, her alcohol intake is on the high side with 3-4 glasses of wine daily. Excessive alcohol use can also lower libido and cause liver enlargement, which was found on her physical examination. Therefore, it is likely that a combination of these factors - sudden menopause due to surgery, psychosocial stress, poor sleep, and excessive alcohol intake - has contributed to her decreased libido.","Menopause, stress, and alcoholism.",Y,"The differential for this patient includes: depression, anxiety, hormonal imbalance, substance use, stress, and side effects from medications. Given that she's been experiencing sleep disturbances and increased tension with her husband due to financial problems, psychological stressors such as anxiety and depression should be considered.

Therefore, the combination of psychological stressors, hormonal changes from her surgery, and potentially unhealthy alcohol use are the most likely causes of her decreased libido.","Stress, hormonal changes, alcohol use.",Y,"This patient's loss of libido can be due to a combination of factors. Firstly, she has undergone a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy a year ago. This surgery leads to a sudden drop in sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone that can affect libido. Additionally, the patient is consuming 3-4 glasses of wine daily which can lead to alcohol use disorder. Chronic alcohol use can cause hepatic damage (as indicated by her enlarged liver) and can also result in sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, her stress related to financial problems, difficulty sleeping, and daytime fatigue can contribute to decreased sexual desire. It's also important to note that relationship problems can also cause loss of libido. These factors together suggest the most likely cause of this patient's loss of libido is a combination of hormonal changes post surgery, possible alcohol use disorder, stress, and relationship ","Hormonal, alcohol, stress, relationship issues",Y,"This patient's loss of libido can be attributed to a few key factors. The most obvious is the hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy she underwent one year ago. This procedure results in a sudden drop in estrogen and testosterone levels, which can lead to reduced sexual desire. Also, the patient reports problems sleeping and feels tired throughout the day. Chronic fatigue can also contribute to a decrease in libido. Additionally, stressors such as marital disputes and financial problems can reduce sexual desire. Lastly, the patient's alcohol consumption can also be a contributing factor. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to liver disease, as evidenced by her enlarged liver, which can also result in hormonal imbalances that reduce libido.",Hormonal imbalance due to oophorectomy,Y,"The Bayesian inference involves the consideration of prior probability and the likelihood of the event given the evidence. In this case, the prior probability of multiple causes for loss of libido in a 50-year-old woman can be quite high, such as hormonal changes, stress, alcohol use, or depression.

The fact that she underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy 1 year ago reduces her estrogen levels significantly. Estrogen affects many parts of the body, including the parts responsible for sexual desire. So, the posterior probability of loss of libido due to hormonal changes after surgery might be around 40%.

Her fights due to financial problems and her difficulty in sleeping suggest stress. Stress is a common cause of decreased libido, which could push our Bayesian probability for stress-related libido loss to around 60%.

She reports being tired throughout the day, which might be due to her disrupted sleep but could also be a sign of depression, another common cause of decreased libido. This increases the probability of depression causing the loss of libido to perhaps 70%.

The patient also drinks 3-4 glasses of wine daily and has an enlarged liver. Chronic alcoholism can cause a decrease in libido, increasing our posterior probability for alcohol-induced loss of libido to 80%.

Considering all factors, the most likely cause of her decreased libido seems to be her alcohol consumption, which is indicated by her liver enlargement and her daily intake of 3-4 glasses of wine. However, the other factors such as hormonal changes due to surgery, stress, and possible depression also contribute to her symptoms and should not be overlooked.",Alcohol consumption,N

Considering her symptoms of unintentional weight loss, bounding pulses, pale complexion, atrial fibrillation, and cognitive difficulty, along with laboratory findings of elevated leukocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and B-12 levels, this patient likely has a hematological disorder.

Her lab values are suggestive of a hematological malignancy. An increased leukocyte count, or leukocytosis, could be due to an infection, inflammation, or a malignancy like leukemia. LDH is commonly elevated in cell turnover or cell destruction processes, which are also common in malignancies. Elevated uric acid can occur due to the high cell turnover rate in some malignancies, leading to tumor lysis syndrome, and elevated B-12 can also be found in myeloproliferative disorders.

Most notably, the presence of the BCR-ABL translocation as evidenced by the Philadelphia chromosome is characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CML is a clonal marrow stem cell disorder in which both mature and immature granulocytes are present in large numbers in the bone marrow and blood. It's also part of the broader category of ""myeloproliferative disorders"" which also include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis. It can present with symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and cognitive difficulties, as seen in this patient. Therefore, her most likely diagnosis is chronic myeloid leukemia.",Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,Y,"This patient's symptoms of unintentional weight loss, elevated heart rate, cognitive difficulty, and atrial fibrillation could have multiple causes, but the laboratory findings point strongly towards a hematologic disorder. Her remarkably elevated leukocyte count of 128,000/mm3, high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and B-12 levels suggest a high turnover of cells, which is typically seen in hematologic malignancies. The BCR-ABL translocation, evidenced by the Philadelphia chromosome, is a specific finding seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This genetic abnormality results in increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. Therefore, her symptoms and the lab findings strongly suggest that this patient has chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).",Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,Y,"This patient's clinical presentation is highly indicative of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). CML is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the overproduction of white blood cells (leukocytosis) and the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (a BCR-ABL translocation), which are both present in this patient. Additionally, the elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and uric acid, as well as an elevated B-12 level, are often found in CML. Furthermore, symptoms such as weight loss, cognitive difficulties, and bounding pulses (which could be related to high circulating blood volume) fit the clinical picture of CML. Atrial fibrillation may be present due to the high cell turnover. Finally, the history of preeclampsia, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and hypercholesterolemia all point towards a chronic disease state and increase the overall risk profile of this patient.",Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,Y,"The prior probability of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is around 1 in 100,000 in the general population. However, in this case, the patient's presentation of significant and unintentional weight loss raises this probability. The patient also has a high white blood cell count of 128,000/mm3, which further increases the probability of CML as it is a common symptom of this disease.

The presence of other symptoms like bounding pulses, irregular heart rate, elevated LDH and uric acid levels, and cognitive difficulty are also associated with CML, but their addition would not as significantly affect the probability as the high leukocyte count and presence of the BCR-ABL translocation, which is a definitive sign of CML, and elevates the probability to almost certainty.

The Philadelphia chromosome is a specific chromosomal abnormality that is associated with CML. This results from a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, and the result is the BCR-ABL gene. The BCR-ABL gene codes for a tyrosine kinase, which is constitutively active, leading to uncontrolled cell division, a hallmark of CML. The presence of this gene translocation in this patient�s lab results confirms the diagnosis of CML. Therefore, given her symptoms and the lab findings, the patient most likely has CML.",Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,Y
"An 8-year-old girl is brought into your clinic with a 5 day history of decreased oral intake, body aches and lymphadenopathy. She has no significant medical history. Upon further questioning you find that the patient frequently plays outside, where she enjoys chasing the neighborhood cats and dogs. She has had no recent sick contacts or travel to foreign countries. The patients vital signs are: temperature 100.4F, HR 80, BP 105/75 and RR 15.

The fact that she spends a lot of time outdoors playing with neighborhood cats and dogs is significant. Cats, in particular, can be carriers of the bacterium Bartonella henselae, which causes Cat Scratch Disease (CSD). This is typically transmitted to humans through a scratch or bite from an infected cat. Notably, there is a nearly healed scratch in the right occipital region, which could be the entry site of the bacterium. The tender right posterior cervical lymph node might be the reactive node to this infection. Given these clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is Cat Scratch Disease.",Cat Scratch Disease,Y,"The differential for this patient includes bacterial lymphadenitis, viral lymphadenitis, cat-scratch disease, mononucleosis, and toxoplasmosis. The history of playing with cats and dogs, the scratch mark, and the symptoms of decreased oral intake, body aches, and lymphadenopathy are consistent with cat-scratch disease. Cat-scratch disease is a common infection that primarily presents as lymphadenopathy in patients with a history of contact with cats, particularly kittens, and often a history of a cat scratch or bite. Bacterial and viral lymphadenitis typically present with more acute symptoms, whereas mononucleosis and toxoplasmosis would have additional systemic symptoms that are not seen in this case.",Cat-scratch disease,Y,"This patient has a history of playing with cats and dogs, lymphadenopathy, and a nearly healed scratch. These symptoms strongly suggest Cat Scratch Disease (CSD), also known as Bartonella henselae infection. CSD is a common cause of chronic lymphadenopathy in children and is associated with exposure to cats, particularly kittens. It typically presents with regional lymphadenopathy that develops 1-3 weeks after a cat scratch or bite.",Cat Scratch Disease,Y,"The symptoms this patient is presenting with, along with the history of interaction with pets and a healing scratch, suggest an infectious process. In this case, one of the most likely diagnoses would be Cat Scratch Disease (also known as Bartonella henselae infection). This disease is commonly contracted from scratches or bites from an infected cat, and typically presents with a primary inoculation lesion (such as a scratch or bite) and regional lymphadenopathy, along with symptoms such as fever, malaise, and anorexia. The cervical lymphadenopathy is often unilateral and tender as seen in this patient.",Cat Scratch Disease,Y,"The prior probability of cat scratch disease in this patient might be around 5%, considering she often plays with cats and dogs. This percentage increases with the finding of lymphadenopathy, let's say to around 20%. Further, a history of a nearly healed scratch could potentially be linked to a cat scratch, which increases the probability to 40%. There is no history of travel to foreign countries or recent sick contacts, which could potentially lower the probability of other infectious diseases, further increasing the posterior probability of cat scratch disease to 50%.

"A newborn infant presents with severe weakness. He was born to a G1P1 mother at 40 weeks gestation with the pregnancy attended by a midwife. The mother's past medical history is unremarkable. She took a prenatal vitamin and folic acid throughout the pregnancy. Since birth, the child has had trouble breastfeeding despite proper counseling. He also has had poor muscle tone and a weak cry. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 57/38 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 37/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. Physical exam reveals poor muscle tone. The patient's sucking reflex is weak, and an enlarged tongue is noted. An ultrasound is performed, and is notable for hypertrophy of the myocardium. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acid maltase deficiency,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,N,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,N,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,N,Congenital Heart Defect,N,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,N,,"The newborn's presentation includes weakness, poor muscle tone, difficulty feeding, weak cry, an enlarged tongue, and myocardial hypertrophy. These symptoms are indicative of a condition that affects muscle strength and development. These symptoms, along with hypertrophy of the myocardium (thickening of the heart muscle), suggest a diagnosis of infantile-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can be a manifestation of a metabolic disorder. The most likely cause in this context, given the age of onset and presenting features, is Pompe disease (also known as glycogen storage disease type II). Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, which is necessary for the breakdown of glycogen within lysosomes. The buildup of glycogen particularly affects muscle cells, including cardiac muscle, leading to the symptoms seen in this newborn.",Pompe disease,Y,"The differential diagnosis for a newborn presenting with severe weakness, poor feeding, enlarged tongue, poor muscle tone and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy includes: congenital myopathies, metabolic disorders, spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital hypothyroidism. Considering the symptomatology, congenital hypothyroidism and metabolic disorders are less likely as they typically do not cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Spinal muscular atrophy is a possibility; however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is not typically seen in this condition. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a congenital myopathy, more specifically, infantile botulism due to the presence of a weak cry, poor sucking reflex, generalized weakness, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",Infantile botulism,N,"This newborn is presenting with severe generalized weakness, poor feeding, poor muscle tone, weak cry, macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and hypertrophy of the myocardium. These are symptoms suggestive of congenital hypothyroidism, also known as cretinism. In severe cases, babies may present with hoarse cry and large tongue. Hypothyroidism in neonates can also lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the heart. This condition is typically identified on newborn screening tests, but if it went undiagnosed, these would be the signs and symptoms one would expect.",Congenital Hypothyroidism,N,"This infant presents with severe weakness, difficulty feeding, hypotonia (poor muscle tone), macroglossia (enlarged tongue), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This constellation of findings is highly suggestive of infantile hypothyroidism, also known as congenital hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism in newborns can result from a variety of causes including thyroid dysgenesis (a developmental anomaly of the thyroid gland), dyshormonogenesis (an inborn error of thyroid hormone production), or maternal factors such as antithyroid drugs or maternal autoimmune thyroid disease. In the absence of adequate thyroid hormone, infants can exhibit delayed development and growth. The hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and macroglossia are all due to the general slowing down of processes in the body due to lack of thyroid hormone. The hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a less common finding, but can occur as a result of the body trying to compensate for the slowed metabolism.",Congenital hypothyroidism,N,"Given the patient's symptoms, let's consider the disease congenital hypothyroidism as the potential diagnosis. The prior probability of congenital hypothyroidism in the general population is around 0.03%. However, the patient exhibits several symptoms that increase this probability:

The patient has poor muscle tone. Hypotonia is a common symptom in newborns with congenital hypothyroidism, which could increase the posterior probability to around 0.1%.

The patient has a weak sucking reflex and an enlarged tongue. Both of these are characteristic signs of congenital hypothyroidism, increasing the posterior probability to around 1%.

The ultrasound shows hypertrophy of the myocardium. This is a less common but possible symptom of severe untreated congenital hypothyroidism and can further increase the posterior probability to around 10%.

Considering these symptoms collectively, and the rarity of their co-occurrence in other conditions, the posterior probability of congenital hypothyroidism is significantly increased.",Congenital Hypothyroidism,N

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Multiple myeloma,Multiple myeloma,Y,Multiple myeloma,Y,Multiple myeloma,Y,Multiple Myeloma,Y,Multiple myeloma,Y,,"This patient presents with severe lower back pain, fatigue, and high serum calcium, along with signs of renal insufficiency (elevated creatinine and BUN). The presence of pale conjunctiva and a low hemoglobin level suggests anemia. The CT scan reveals low-density lesions in his lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones. Taken together, these symptoms and test results strongly suggest multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that forms in a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell, which can lead to excessive production of a certain type of protein (monoclonal protein). This protein can lead to hypercalcemia and renal dysfunction and can also cause lytic bone lesions, which likely explains the patient's severe back pain and the lesions found in the lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones.",Multiple Myeloma,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: multiple myeloma, metastatic cancer (e.g. prostate cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer), primary hyperparathyroidism, and renal disease. The elevated calcium level, renal dysfunction (as indicated by elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine), anemia (as indicated by low hemoglobin), and bone lesions are collectively known as the ""CRAB"" criteria (Calcium elevation, Renal dysfunction, Anemia, Bone lesions) associated with multiple myeloma. This patient does not have other symptoms common in metastatic cancer such as weight loss, cough, or changes in urination (prostate cancer). The lack of hypercalcemia symptoms like abdominal pain, peptic ulcers, constipation or depression and normal albumin rules out primary hyperparathyroidism. Even though renal disease can also cause anemia and elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine, it does not explain the bone lesions and elevated calcium. Hence, given the CRAB criteria, this patient most likely has multiple myeloma.",Multiple myeloma,Y,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of a hematologic malignancy, specifically multiple myeloma. This is supported by his older age, back pain with a lytic lesion found in the vertebra on CT scan, anemia, and renal insufficiency (elevated creatinine and BUN), along with hypercalcemia. All these features are commonly seen in multiple myeloma, a cancer that affects plasma cells and often leads to pathologic fractures, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, and normocytic anemia.",Multiple Myeloma,Y,"The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest a systemic disease. The severe lower back pain, fatigue, anemia (hemoglobin 9 g/dL), hypercalcemia (calcium 11.5 mg/dL), and renal impairment (urea nitrogen 54 mg/dL, creatinine 2.5 mg/dL) are classic features of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. This leads to increased production of monoclonal protein (usually IgG or IgA), which can cause kidney damage and hypercalcemia. The back pain and the CT findings are consistent with lytic bone lesions, another feature of multiple myeloma, caused by the increased osteoclast activity induced by the malignant plasma cells. The lytic lesions lead to bone pain and increase serum calcium levels.",Multiple Myeloma,Y,"In a Bayesian analysis, we start with the prior probability of certain conditions in a patient with the given symptoms and medical history, then update this with the likelihood of the patient's symptoms given each of these conditions, to obtain the posterior probability.

The prior probability of multiple myeloma in an elderly patient with no serious illness history might be around 2%. Given this patient's presentation, several symptoms increase the likelihood of multiple myeloma:

Severe back pain and fatigue for several months: This increases the posterior probability to around 10%. The pain that increases with activity and the localization to the lower back (particularly over a lumbar vertebra) are suggestive of a skeletal involvement, which is characteristic in multiple myeloma.
Conjunctival pallor: This symptom, indicating anemia, increases the posterior probability to 20%. Anemia is commonly seen in multiple myeloma due to the replacement of the bone marrow with malignant plasma cells.
Elevated calcium level: This symptom further increases the posterior probability to 40%. Hypercalcemia occurs in multiple myeloma due to increased osteoclastic bone resorption.
Elevated creatinine: This symptom further increases the posterior probability to 60%. Renal insufficiency is often present in multiple myeloma due to factors such as hypercalcemia and light chain deposition disease.
Low-density lesions in the lumbar vertebra and pelvic bones: The presence of these lesions on CT scan is highly indicative of multiple myeloma, which further increases the posterior probability to 90%.
Given this chain of Bayesian reasoning, the most likely diagnosis is multiple myeloma.",Multiple myeloma.,Y

The presence of a harsh, holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border along with jugular venous distention, right parasternal heave, and lower extremity pitting edema, all suggest a severe left-sided heart failure. Given the acute setting, the most likely etiology is a post-myocardial infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD). These defects can occur as a complication of myocardial infarction and present with signs of heart failure, hypotension, and a new murmur.",Ventricular septal defect,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's hypotension includes: cardiogenic shock due to a possible myocardial infarction, ventricular septal defect (VSD) post-myocardial infarction, severe valvular heart disease, congestive heart failure, or a drug reaction. The presence of a new harsh, holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border, along with the findings of jugular venous distension, right parasternal heave, and bilateral lower extremity edema, are suggestive of significant left-to-right shunt. Given the patient's recent history of myocardial infarction with coronary stenting, this is most likely due to the development of a post-infarction ventricular septal defect (VSD).

In the context of a recent myocardial infarction, necrotic cardiac tissue can result in the rupture of the interventricular septum, leading to an abrupt communication between the left and right ventricles. The clinical picture will then be characterized by signs of left and right heart failure, such as the ones seen in our patient. The Q waves in the inferior leads suggest a previous inferior wall MI, which could have predisposed to the VSD. The murmur of a VSD is typically holosystolic and is best heard at the left lower sternal border.",Post-infarction ventricular septal defect,Y,"The patient presented with a recent history of acute chest pain, dyspnea, and now sudden hypotension. He also had an occlusion in the left anterior descending artery for which a stent was placed. His physical examination reveals a new harsh, holosystolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border, jugular venous distention, a right parasternal heave, and bilateral pitting edema up to the knees. These findings strongly suggest left-sided heart failure due to a possible complication from the myocardial infarction, such as ventricular septal rupture. Ventricular septal rupture following a myocardial infarction would present with a new holosystolic murmur and signs of heart failure, which would also explain the hypotension.",Ventricular septal rupture,Y,"This patient presents with several symptoms suggesting the presence of ventricular septal defect (VSD), specifically, post-myocardial infarction VSD. This is supported by his recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), his new harsh, holosystolic murmur that is heard best at the left sternal border, and hypotension. The new murmur is suggestive of a septal rupture due to the myocardial infarction (MI) he recently suffered, leading to a left-to-right shunt. The shunt causes blood to move from the left ventricle to the right ventricle, leading to an increase in the right ventricular pressure and volume. The increased volume then leads to right heart failure symptoms such as jugular venous distention, pitting edema, and parasternal heave. Additionally, this shunting decreases the forward flow of blood, which can cause hypotension, as seen in this patient.",Ventricular Septal Defect,Y,"The initial probability of a ventricular septal rupture (VSR) after a myocardial infarction is about 1-2%. The presence of the harsh, holosystolic murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a clinical sign often associated with VSR, increases the posterior probability of this condition to approximately 20%. Additionally, the fact that the patient has a right parasternal heave, indicative of right ventricular hypertrophy often seen with left to right shunts such as VSR, increases the likelihood to around 40%. The presence of signs of congestive heart failure, such as jugular venous distention and bilateral pitting edema, further increase the probability to about 60%. Given that the patient's hypotension started after the successful stent placement for his occluded left anterior descending artery, the posterior probability of a VSR, which can lead to cardiogenic shock, increases to 80%.

Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency can manifest as neurological symptoms including seizures and hyperreflexia (brisk DTRs). Additionally, the prolonged QT interval can be due to magnesium deficiency which is also commonly seen in chronic alcoholism. Among these deficiencies, thiamine deficiency is more directly linked to neurologic abnormalities, such as the seizure and brisk DTRs this patient experienced.",Thiamine deficiency,N,"The differential diagnoses for this patient's condition include alcohol withdrawal, electrolyte abnormalities (such as magnesium or potassium deficiency), withdrawal seizures, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, or nutritional deficiencies (such as thiamine or B12 deficiency).

The symptom of palpitations and the EKG finding of a prolonged QT interval could be due to an electrolyte imbalance, particularly a deficiency of magnesium or potassium. However, this is less likely to cause seizures or the neurological signs noted in the physical exam (moderate extremity weakness, brisk DTRs).

Alcohol withdrawal could explain the seizures and some of the neurological symptoms, but it is less likely to cause a prolonged QT interval unless severe, in which case you might expect more overt signs of withdrawal.

Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, caused by a deficiency of thiamine, could explain the neurological signs but is less likely to cause a prolonged QT interval or seizures.

Considering the constellation of neurological symptoms (seizures, weakness, brisk DTRs), palpitations, and the EKG finding of a prolonged QT interval, the most likely diagnosis is a deficiency of magnesium. Alcohol abuse is known to cause magnesium deficiency due to poor dietary intake, gastrointestinal losses, and renal wasting. This deficiency can cause neuromuscular irritability (explaining the weakness and brisk DTRs), seizures, and cardiac effects including palpitations and a prolonged QT interval.",Magnesium deficiency,Y,"This patient's recent history of alcohol abuse, malnutrition, and the specific finding of a prolonged QT interval on EKG strongly suggest a deficiency of magnesium.

These are classic symptoms of a retinal detachment. This condition is an ophthalmologic emergency. Given that he had a recent cataract surgery, he is at increased risk, as cataract surgery is a known risk factor for retinal detachment. The nasal and inferior visual field defects on the left side also align with the diagnosis of a retinal detachment.",Retinal detachment,Y,"This patient presents with sudden vision loss, perception of black spots (floaters), flashes of light, and a sensation of a ""curtain hanging over his eye"", all localized to one eye and not associated with pain. These are classic symptoms of retinal detachment, a serious ophthalmologic emergency. In this case, the risk is particularly heightened due to his recent cataract surgery, which is a known risk factor for retinal detachment. The confrontation test showing nasal and inferior defects in the left eye further supports this diagnosis. While he does have a family history of open-angle glaucoma, the absence of pain makes acute glaucoma less likely.",Retinal Detachment,Y,"The prior probability of retinal detachment is 10%. The presence of symptoms such as decreased vision increases the likelihood to 20%. The patient's description of seeing black spots or 'floaters' further increases the probability to 40%. The sensation of 'a curtain hanging over his eye' is highly indicative of retinal detachment, which increases the probability to 75%. Recent cataract surgery is a risk factor for retinal detachment, which raises the probability to about 85%. Additionally, the confrontation test reveals nasal and inferior defects on the affected side, which is consistent with retinal detachment, further raising the probability to around 90%.

She takes escitalopram for generalized anxiety disorder. She also has tension headaches several times a month. Her maternal uncle has ankylosing spondylitis. Examination shows marked tenderness over the posterior neck, bilateral mid trapezius, and medial aspect of the left knee. Muscle strength is normal.

These symptoms have been ongoing for over a year. A critical clue is that the pain is present in specific regions described as tender points, such as the posterior neck and bilateral mid trapezius. This pattern of chronic, widespread pain and tenderness at specific sites is highly suggestive of fibromyalgia. The normal lab results and absence of abnormalities on the X-rays of the spine further support this diagnosis, as fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis not associated with specific lab or imaging findings. It's worth mentioning that fibromyalgia can be associated with other disorders such as anxiety, which this patient is already being treated for.",Fibromyalgia,Y,"The differential for this patient includes fibromyalgia, polymyalgia rheumatica, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and thyroid disease. Her symptoms of widespread pain, morning stiffness, and tingling are suggestive of fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica. However, her age and the absence of abnormal inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) makes polymyalgia rheumatica and rheumatoid arthritis less likely. Her uncle's history of ankylosing spondylitis might suggest a genetic predisposition for autoimmune diseases, but her normal spine X-rays and lack of lower back pain make this diagnosis less likely. Thyroid disease can cause symptoms of pain and fatigue, but her normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels rule this out.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is a possibility, but it is more characterized by severe fatigue, not pain as the primary symptom. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tenderness in localized areas. It often coexists with mood disorders such as anxiety, which she has, and can be exacerbated by stress or lack of sleep, as in this patient. Normal lab results and the absence of joint inflammation are also typical for fibromyalgia, so this diagnosis fits best with her clinical picture.",Fibromyalgia,Y,"This patient's recurrent, severe pain in the neck, back, and shoulders, with associated morning stiffness and tingling in the upper extremities, suggest a chronic musculoskeletal disorder. However, normal laboratory studies, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a marker of inflammation), and normal radiographic imaging of the cervical and lumbar spine, argue against inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or her uncle's ankylosing spondylitis. Instead, the patient's marked tenderness in specific areas, known as 'tender points', points toward fibromyalgia, a disorder characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and tender points. The coexistence of generalized anxiety disorder and tension headaches in this patient is also common in fibromyalgia. This condition is often a diagnosis of exclusion once other potential causes of the symptoms have been ruled out.",Fibromyalgia,Y,"This patient presents with symptoms that are characteristic of fibromyalgia. The widespread musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, tingling, exacerbated by physical stressors and lack of sleep, along with normal laboratory results, are hallmarks of this condition. The marked tenderness found in specific areas, referred to as tender points, is a diagnostic criterion for fibromyalgia. Additionally, the condition is often comorbid with mood disorders such as anxiety, which this patient also has. Despite her family history of ankylosing spondylitis, the absence of inflammatory findings on blood work and normal X-rays make this diagnosis less likely.",Fibromyalgia,Y,"The prior probability of fibromyalgia in this patient is around 2-4% given her age and gender.

He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and was diagnosed with hypertension 20 years ago. His sister has systemic sclerosis. He works as an office administrator and sits at his desk most of the day. He has smoked one and a half packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Current medications include metformin and lisinopril. His pulse is 110/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. His right leg is pale and cool to touch. Muscle strength in his right leg is mildly reduced.

He has risk factors for arterial thrombosis, including a long history of smoking and sedentary lifestyle, which are known to cause peripheral artery disease and increase the risk of arterial thrombosis. Furthermore, his long-standing hypertension and diabetes mellitus can lead to accelerated atherosclerosis, which can result in plaque rupture and subsequent clot formation in the arteries. Therefore, it is most likely that an arterial thrombosis has caused the sudden pain and other symptoms in his right calf and foot.",Arterial thrombosis,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: acute arterial occlusion, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), peripheral artery disease (PAD), diabetic neuropathy, or lumbar radiculopathy. The acute onset of pain, sensory changes, motor weakness, paleness, coolness, and the absence of pedal pulses in the affected leg are suggestive of acute arterial occlusion, likely due to an embolism. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) usually presents with a swollen, red, warm leg and does not lead to acute limb ischemia. Peripheral artery disease and diabetic neuropathy generally have a more insidious onset. Lumbar radiculopathy would not explain the absence of pulses. His risk factors for a thromboembolic event include smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and a sedentary job. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is acute arterial occlusion.",Acute arterial occlusion,Y,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of acute limb ischemia, which is characterized by sudden onset of limb pain, pallor, pulselessness, paresthesia, and paralysis (the ""five Ps""). His history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle places him at high risk for atherosclerotic disease, which is the most common cause of acute limb ischemia. The underlying mechanism is typically embolization or in situ thrombosis of an atherosclerotic artery. In this case, the absence of a history of claudication or previous similar episodes suggests an embolic event.",Embolism from atherosclerosis,Y,"This patient presents with acute onset of pain, pallor, paresthesia (tingling sensation), paralysis (weakness), and pulselessness in his right leg, all of which point towards acute limb ischemia. Given his history of smoking, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, he is at a high risk for atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can cause stenosis or occlusion of peripheral arteries. It is probable that a thrombus formed in a diseased artery (most likely in the patient's leg), leading to sudden ischemia. Sitting for extended periods as he does in his office job may also increase his risk for thrombus formation due to blood stasis. Therefore, his symptoms are likely the result of acute limb ischemia secondary to peripheral artery disease from atherosclerosis.",Acute limb ischemia,Y,"The prior probability of acute limb ischemia in a 65-year-old male is around 0.1%.

The physical exam findings of pale, cool leg and absent pedal pulses are characteristic of acute arterial occlusion, raising the probability further to 20%. The patient's sedentary lifestyle may contribute to deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but in DVT, the limb would typically be warm and swollen, not cool and pale. Therefore, the combination of risk factors, symptoms, and physical findings make acute limb ischemia due to an arterial occlusion the most likely diagnosis.",Arterial Occlusion,Y

"A 55-year-old man is seen in the hospital for new onset shortness of breath. The patient was hospitalized 5 days ago after initially presenting with chest pain. He was found to have an ST-elevation myocardial infarction. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement with resolution of his chest pain. He states that he was doing well until yesterday when he developed dyspnea while walking around the hall and occasionally when getting out of bed to use the bathroom. His shortness of breath has since progressed, and he is now having trouble breathing even at rest. His medical history is also significant for type II diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolemia. He takes aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 97°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 133/62, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. On physical examination, there is a holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla and an S3 heart sound. Coarse crackles are heard bilaterally. An electrocardiogram, a chest radiograph, and cardiac enzyme levels are pending. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Papillary muscle rupture,Cardiogenic pulmonary edema,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure.,N,Congestive heart failure,N,Congestive heart failure,N,,"This patient presented with symptoms of shortness of breath, especially upon exertion, that have worsened even at rest. He has a history of a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction and has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stent placement. His physical examination reveals a holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla and an S3 heart sound, both of which suggest the presence of left ventricular dysfunction. The presence of bilateral coarse crackles on lung auscultation indicates pulmonary congestion, a common sign of heart failure. Therefore, considering his recent cardiac history, the clinical symptoms, and the physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is post-MI (myocardial infarction) congestive heart failure, a common complication after myocardial infarction.",Post-MI Congestive Heart Failure,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include heart failure, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, or post-infarction pericarditis.

Heart Failure: His history of recent myocardial infarction, new onset shortness of breath at rest and on exertion, a new holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla (which might indicate mitral regurgitation), an S3 sound (suggestive of heart failure), and coarse crackles in the lungs (which might suggest fluid overload due to heart failure) are in line with a diagnosis of heart failure.

Pneumonia: Although pneumonia might cause shortness of breath and crackles in the lungs, his systemic symptoms like fever or productive cough are absent. Moreover, a new heart murmur and S3 sound aren't typical for pneumonia.

Pulmonary Embolism: A patient with recent myocardial infarction is at risk for pulmonary embolism, but in addition to the shortness of breath, PE usually presents with chest pain, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. However, a new heart murmur and S3 sound aren't typical for PE.

Myocardial Infarction: He had a myocardial infarction recently, but the new onset of shortness of breath, new heart murmur and the S3 sound might suggest a complication after the myocardial infarction rather than a new event.

Post-Infarction Pericarditis: This typically presents with pleuritic chest pain, which the patient doesn't report.

The combination of symptoms suggests that this patient has developed heart failure, potentially due to a complication like mitral regurgitation after the recent myocardial infarction.",Heart failure,N,"The patient presents with a history of recent myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, now exhibiting new onset dyspnea at rest, coarse crackles on lung auscultation, and an S3 heart sound with a holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. The S3 heart sound is often associated with heart failure, as is dyspnea at rest. The murmur suggests possible mitral regurgitation, which could occur secondary to ischemic injury from the myocardial infarction affecting the function of the mitral valve apparatus, particularly the papillary muscles. Taken together, these findings point to the possibility of heart failure with a mitral regurgitation.",Heart failure with mitral regurgitation,Y,"The patient's clinical picture suggests a diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), a common complication after a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient has a history of MI with stent placement, and now presents with dyspnea, which has progressively worsened to the point of trouble breathing even at rest. This could be due to a decrease in the heart's pumping efficiency post-MI leading to congestion in the lungs, manifesting as shortness of breath and coarse crackles heard on auscultation.

An important clue is the new holosystolic murmur that radiates to the axilla, which is indicative of mitral regurgitation. This can occur due to the dysfunction of the left ventricle post-MI, specifically the papillary muscles that control the mitral valve, leading to incomplete closure of the valve and backflow of blood into the left atrium. The S3 heart sound, another clinical sign of heart failure, further supports this diagnosis.

ADHF would also explain the patient's reduced oxygen saturation as a result of impaired gas exchange in the congested lungs.",Acute decompensated heart failure,N,"The prior probability of mitral regurgitation (MR) in the general population is relatively low, let's say 2%. However, the clinical context for this patient dramatically modifies this prior probability. First, this patient has had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) 5 days ago. After STEMI, some patients can develop MR due to papillary muscle rupture or dysfunction, which increases the posterior probability of MR to, say, 25%. The patient's presenting symptoms, including new-onset shortness of breath, could be due to the left ventricular volume overload caused by MR. This symptom further increases the posterior probability of MR to 50%. On physical examination, the patient has a holosystolic murmur radiating to the axilla, which is a classic presentation for MR. This finding further increases the posterior probability of MR to 80%. Furthermore, an S3 heart sound is often a sign of left ventricular dysfunction, which could be due to the increased volume load in the context of MR, further increasing the probability to 90%. Given these Bayesian inferences, this patient most likely has mitral regurgitation due to complications from his recent myocardial infarction.",Mitral Regurgitation,Y

He has symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and has physical findings of ptosis and a high-arched palate, suggesting a neuromuscular disorder. His reduced strength in the face and hands but preserved strength in the quadriceps and hamstrings suggests a condition affecting the peripheral nerves or muscles, and his sensation is intact, which makes a central nervous system disorder less likely. Furthermore, the boy's reaction to percussion of the thenar eminence, where his thumb abducts and then relaxes slowly, is a positive sign of myotonia. This symptom is typical for myotonic dystrophy, a type of muscular dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle wasting and weakness, and is often associated with other signs like ptosis, high-arched palate, and daytime sleepiness.

Ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), high-arched palate, and decreased muscle strength especially in the face and hands, along with the unusual reaction of the thumb to percussion, suggest a disorder of the nerves controlling these muscles. The fact that the child's attention and learning are affected could also point towards fatigue related to this condition. The thumb abduction and then slow relaxation upon percussion of the thenar eminence is a positive 'myotonic' reaction. This is typical of myotonic dystrophy, a type of muscular dystrophy. In this condition, the muscles contract normally but have difficulty relaxing. Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that affects not only the muscles but also many other systems in the body, causing symptoms like daytime sleepiness and cognitive issues. This child's frequent sleepiness and issues at school could also be explained by this diagnosis.",Myotonic dystrophy,Y,"This child presents with symptoms suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder. Notably, he has ptosis (drooping of the eyelids), a high-arched palate, and decreased facial and hand strength. The percussion of the thenar eminence, causing the thumb to abduct and then slowly relax, is a positive percussion test or ""myotonic"" response, which is characteristic of myotonic dystrophy. This condition is the most common form of muscular dystrophy that begins in adulthood, but it can also present in childhood or infancy. The condition is characterized by myotonia (an inability to quickly relax muscles following a sudden contraction), muscle wasting, weakness, and various systemic manifestations, such as daytime sleepiness (which may explain why he is frequently falling asleep in class), intellectual impairment (potentially explaining his academic difficulties), and pain.",Myotonic dystrophy,Y,"The prior probability of Myotonic Dystrophy is about 0.01%, given the overall rarity of the disease. However, this patient's presentation with ptosis (drooping eyelids), high-arched palate, and decreased muscle strength in the face and hands increases the probability of Myotonic Dystrophy to about 25%. Additionally, this patient exhibits signs of daytime sleepiness and academic difficulties, which are associated with cognitive effects of Myotonic Dystrophy, thereby increasing the posterior probability to 50%. The ""lagging behind"" in school can be an indicator of cognitive impairment often seen in this condition. The symptom of leg pain can be a manifestation of myotonia in the lower limbs and therefore further increases the probability to about 75%. Finally, a very specific sign in this case, which is a telltale sign of myotonia, is the slow relaxation of the thumb after percussion of the thenar eminence (Myotonic grip). This finding, called the 'percussion myotonia' sign, is classic for Myotonic Dystrophy and increases the posterior probability to about 95%.

This condition is a type of ventricular preexcitation syndrome, where an accessory pathway (the bundle of Kent) allows electrical signals to bypass the normal route through the AV node. This results in part of the ventricles depolarizing earlier than usual (hence the short P-R interval and delta wave). The fast heart rate seen in this case may represent an episode of supraventricular tachycardia, a common complication of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.",Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in the general pediatric population is low.

The recurrence of her pain around the same time each month suggests a relationship with her menstrual cycle and ovulation.",Mittelschmerz,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: pregnancy (possible ectopic), pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ovarian cyst, menstrual cramps, endometriosis, and possibly appendicitis. Pregnancy could be ruled out based on the fact that her menses are ongoing. PID typically presents with adnexal tenderness or cervical motion tenderness, both of which are absent in this case. Appendicitis usually presents with other signs like right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and/or vomiting, none of which are mentioned here. Ovarian cysts can cause lower abdominal pain, but the pain typically does not recur monthly. Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) can cause significant pain, but it typically coincides with menstruation, which is not specifically mentioned here. The recurring nature of the severe pain, lower back pain and the timing (roughly once a month), in a sexually active woman not using contraception points towards endometriosis. This is a condition in which tissue similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside of it, causing severe pain often associated with menstruation.",Endometriosis,N,"The patient's severe abdominal and lower back pain, associated with her menstrual cycle, but with an otherwise unremarkable physical examination suggests a gynecological issue related to menstruation. The diagnosis that fits most closely with these findings is primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is a diagnosis of exclusion, and is characterized by painful menses in women with normal pelvic anatomy. It usually begins during adolescence, shortly after menarche (the onset of menstruation), when ovulatory cycles are established. The pain is typically crampy, beginning with the onset of menses and lasting for several hours to several days. It is often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and headache. Given the nature and timing of her symptoms, and the lack of other significant findings on physical examination, primary dysmenorrhea is the most likely diagnosis.",Primary dysmenorrhea,Y,"This patient presents with cyclic, crampy abdominal and lower back pain and heavy menstrual bleeding, which is suggestive of dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea refers to pain associated with menstruation and is commonly associated with heavy menstrual bleeding. This condition is usually secondary to increased production of endometrial prostaglandins and can present with the symptoms described by the patient. The absence of adnexal masses or tenderness and cervical motion tenderness rules out conditions such as ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, or endometriosis, which usually present with these physical findings. In sexually active women not using contraception, pregnancy should be considered, but the recurrent nature of the pain and the association with menses suggests that dysmenorrhea is more likely in this case.",Dysmenorrhea,Y,"Starting with the prior probability of mittelschmerz, which is the medical term for ""middle pain"" referring to ovulation pain, being around 20% in the general population, we update this given the new information.

The patient describes an intense cramping pain which is consistent with mittelschmerz, increasing the posterior probability to 30%. She also describes a pattern of experiencing this severe pain roughly 1 month ago, which aligns with the menstrual cycle and increases the probability to 50%. The absence of findings on abdominal and pelvic exam, such as adnexal masses or tenderness, supports that this is not likely a complication of an ovarian cyst or another pelvic pathology, and increases the probability to 70%.

The fact that she is not using any contraception means there is no hormonal suppression of ovulation, which leaves the possibility of ovulation-related pain. Furthermore, her light menstrual flow (soaking through only 1 pad per day) is less consistent with conditions such as endometriosis that might also cause cyclical pain, increasing the probability to 80%. Thus, this patient most likely has mittelschmerz.",Mittelschmerz,Y
"A 22-year-old man comes to the emergency department for pain and swelling of his left knee one day after injuring it while playing soccer. While sprinting on the field, he slipped as he attempted to kick the ball and landed on the anterior aspect of his knee. He underwent an appendectomy at the age of 16 years. His vitals signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a swollen and tender left knee; range of motion is limited by pain. The tibial tuberosity shows tenderness to palpation. The left tibia is displaced posteriorly when force is applied to the proximal tibia after flexing the knee. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the left knee joint shows an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Posterior cruciate ligament injury,Osgood-Schlatter disease,N,Avulsion fracture,N,Avulsion fracture,N,Avulsion fracture,N,Osgood-Schlatter,N,,"The mechanism of injury described, where the patient slipped while kicking a ball and landed on the anterior aspect of his knee, suggests a powerful quadriceps contraction while the knee was flexed - a classic description of a ""dashboard injury."" The physical examination finding of a posteriorly displaced tibia with the knee flexed is consistent with a positive posterior drawer sign. The positive posterior drawer sign indicates injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), the primary restraint to posterior translation of the tibia. Additionally, the X-ray shows an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle, a common finding associated with PCL injuries due to the forceful pull of the ligament on its attachment site during the injury. Therefore, a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury is the most likely diagnosis.",Posterior Cruciate Ligament Injury,Y,"The differential for this patient includes a ligament tear, meniscus injury, fracture, patellar dislocation, and dislocation of the knee. The patient's history of trauma while playing soccer and his physical examination findings are indicative of a knee injury. The displacement of the tibia posteriorly when force is applied after flexing the knee is consistent with a positive posterior drawer test, indicative of a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The X-ray findings of an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle further support a PCL injury because the PCL attaches at the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia, and avulsion fractures often occur with ligament injuries.",Posterior cruciate ligament injury,Y,"This patient's history of an acute knee injury, findings of a swollen and tender knee with limited range of motion, and physical examination suggestive of posterior displacement of the tibia on the femur (positive posterior drawer sign) all suggest an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The PCL is most commonly injured by a direct blow to the flexed knee, such as when the anterior aspect of the knee hits the dashboard in a car accident (""dashboard injury"") or, as in this case, falls onto the anterior aspect of the knee. The avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle identified on X-ray further supports the diagnosis as PCL tears often involve such avulsion fractures.",Posterior cruciate ligament injury,Y,"The patient's history of acute injury while playing soccer, presentation of knee pain and swelling, and physical exam findings consistent with posterior displacement of the tibia when the knee is flexed suggest a disruption in the posterior support structures of the knee. The primary posterior stabilizer of the knee is the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). A strong force applied to the proximal tibia when the knee is flexed, as described in this scenario, is a classic mechanism for PCL injury. Additionally, the x-ray findings of an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle further support this diagnosis as this injury can occur when the PCL, which attaches to the tibial condyle, is forcefully stretched during trauma, pulling a fragment of bone away with it. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury.",Posterior cruciate ligament injury,Y,"The prior probability of an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury is 5% in general population. However, in the setting of sports, particularly soccer, this probability increases to 15%. Given the patient's mechanism of injury, which involved a sudden change in direction and landing on the anterior aspect of his knee, the probability of an ACL injury rises to 30%. The patient's physical examination finding of posterior displacement of the tibia with the knee in flexion (the posterior drawer test) is highly suggestive of an ACL injury, raising the probability further to 60%. Finally, the presence of an avulsion fracture of the tibial condyle on X-ray is consistent with a tibial spine avulsion, a type of ACL injury, bringing the final probability to about 80%. Therefore, this patient most likely has an ACL injury.",ACL injury,N
"A 32-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of increasing lethargy, frequent upper respiratory tract infections, and easy bruising. Past medical history is unremarkable. The patient reports a 14-pack-year smoking history and says he drinks alcohol socially. No significant family history. His vital signs include: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure 132/91 mm Hg and pulse 95/min. Physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor and scattered ecchymoses on the lower extremities. Laboratory results are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 8.2 g/dL
Leukocyte count 2,200/mm3
Platelet count 88,000/mm3
Reticulocyte count 0.5%
A bone marrow biopsy is performed, which demonstrates hypocellularity with no abnormal cell population. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient? ",Aplastic anemia,Aplastic anemia,Y,Aplastic anemia,Y,Aplastic anemia,Y,Aplastic anemia,Y,Aplastic anemia,Y,,"This patient presents with a history of lethargy, frequent infections, and easy bruising, all of which suggest some form of systemic illness, particularly one that might affect the hematological system. The lab results show anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low leukocyte count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The low reticulocyte count indicates that the bone marrow is not producing new red blood cells effectively, even though the patient is anemic, which suggests a bone marrow problem. The bone marrow biopsy shows hypocellularity, further indicating a problem with the bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells. These findings are characteristic of aplastic anemia, a condition in which the body stops producing enough new blood cells, often due to damage or deficiency in the stem cells in the bone marrow.",Aplastic Anemia,Y,"The differential for this patient includes aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, leukemia, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or a side effect from an unidentified toxin such as a medication or heavy metals. The significant findings on the lab tests, such as low hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet count, point towards a disease that affects the entire bone marrow since all cell lines are reduced, which is termed pancytopenia. This makes aplastic anemia a likely diagnosis. Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency could also lead to pancytopenia, but the patient's reticulocyte count is low, suggesting that the bone marrow isn't responding to the low red cell count, which would not be expected in B12 or folate deficiency. Leukemia could present with pancytopenia as well but usually comes with an abnormal cell population in bone marrow, which is not the case here. Myelodysplastic syndrome often presents with cytopenias, but there are usually dysplastic changes in the bone marrow, which is also not seen in this case. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol use might suggest a toxin-induced bone marrow failure, but the most likely diagnosis given all the findings seems to be idiopathic aplastic anemia, especially considering his age and relatively unremarkable past medical history.",Aplastic Anemia,Y,"This patient's symptoms of fatigue, frequent infections, and easy bruising, in combination with the laboratory findings of pancytopenia (low hemoglobin indicating anemia, low leukocytes indicating leukopenia, and low platelets indicating thrombocytopenia) suggest a problem with the bone marrow. The low reticulocyte count indicates that the bone marrow is not responding adequately to the anemia, which would be expected in a healthy individual. Furthermore, the bone marrow biopsy shows hypocellularity, which is indicative of aplastic anemia, a condition in which the body fails to produce enough new blood cells due to a failure in bone marrow function.",Aplastic Anemia,Y,"The patient has symptoms consistent with pancytopenia, as demonstrated by low levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets. Pancytopenia can be caused by a variety of conditions, such as leukemia, lymphoma, aplastic anemia, or certain infections. However, the bone marrow biopsy shows hypocellularity without any abnormal cell population, ruling out leukemia or lymphoma. In addition, the patient's low reticulocyte count indicates that his bone marrow is not producing new red blood cells as it should be in response to anemia. This lack of compensatory increase in reticulocyte count alongside the hypocellularity of the bone marrow strongly suggests a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a condition where the bone marrow does not produce sufficient new cells to replenish blood cells.",Aplastic Anemia,Y,"The prior probability of aplastic anemia is typically low in the general population. However, this patient has pancytopenia, evidenced by low hemoglobin, low leukocyte count, and low platelet count, which increases the posterior probability of aplastic anemia significantly. The presence of reticulocytopenia further raises the probability, indicating inadequate bone marrow response to anemia. Moreover, the bone marrow biopsy shows hypocellularity without abnormal cell population, which is the key hallmark of aplastic anemia. Taken together, these findings significantly increase the probability of aplastic anemia in this patient.",Aplastic anemia,Y
"A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of slurred speech and left facial droop for the past 30 minutes. During this period, she has also had numbness on the left side of her face. She has never had such an episode before. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her father died of lung cancer 1 week ago. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks one glass of wine daily. Her current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 30.5 kg/m2. She is oriented to time, place, and person. Her temperature is 37°C (98.7°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg. Examination shows drooping of the left side of the face. Her speech is clear. Examination shows full muscle strength. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. A finger-nose test and her gait are normal. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a right-sided carotid bruit. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of creatinine, glucose, and electrolytes are within the reference ranges. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy. A noncontrast CT scan of the brain shows no abnormalities. On the way back from the CT scan, her presenting symptoms resolve. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Transient ischemic attack,Transient ischemic attack (TIA),Y,Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA),Y,Transient ischemic attack (TIA),Y,Transient ischemic attack,Y,TIA.,Y,,"This patient presents with acute onset slurred speech, left facial droop, and left-sided facial numbness that resolved completely within a short period of time. This transient episode suggests a lack of blood supply to the brain, specifically in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery, but with complete symptom resolution indicates it was temporary. The history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking further raise the risk of a cerebrovascular event. In the absence of any abnormal findings on the noncontrast CT scan of the brain, this set of symptoms is characteristic of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is essentially a brief, reversible episode of neurological dysfunction caused by ischemia.",Transient Ischemic Attack,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), migraine, brain tumor, multiple sclerosis, or seizure. The absence of abnormalities on the noncontrast CT scan of the brain rules out a stroke or brain tumor. Migraine typically does not cause symptoms like facial drooping and is less likely given the patient's age and absence of a headache. Multiple sclerosis is also less likely given the acute onset of her symptoms and their complete resolution. The presence of a right-sided carotid bruit indicates some degree of carotid artery disease, increasing the risk of cerebral ischemia. Her risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking, increase her risk for cerebrovascular disease. Given her clinical presentation of sudden onset neurologic symptoms that completely resolved within a short time frame, the most likely diagnosis is transient ischemic attack (TIA).",Transient Ischemic Attack,Y,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also known as a ""mini-stroke."" TIA symptoms are similar to those of a stroke, but they last for a short duration and leave no permanent neurological damage. They include sudden onset of slurred speech, facial droop, and numbness or weakness, usually on one side of the body. In this patient, these symptoms lasted for 30 minutes and then resolved. The presence of a carotid bruit, indicating turbulent blood flow, also suggests that a clot or atherosclerosis may be present in the carotid artery, which could lead to ischemia of the brain if a piece dislodges and blocks the flow of blood. Risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes, and smoking also increase the likelihood of a TIA.",Transient ischemic attack,Y,"The patient presents with sudden onset of slurred speech and left facial droop, suggestive of a neurologic event. The fact that these symptoms resolved completely in a relatively short period suggests a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is often referred to as a ""mini-stroke"". TIAs are typically caused by a temporary decrease in blood supply to part of the brain, which results in transient neurologic dysfunction. The symptoms usually last less than an hour and there are no lasting effects. Risk factors for TIA in this patient include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking, and the presence of a right-sided carotid bruit (indicating possible carotid artery stenosis). The normal CT scan of the brain also supports the diagnosis of TIA, as TIAs do not usually result in lasting brain tissue damage that can be visualized on imaging studies.",Transient Ischemic Attack,Y,"The prior probability of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) in this context is about 2%. This woman presents with sudden onset of slurred speech, left facial droop, and numbness on the left side of her face, symptoms suggestive of a neurological deficit, which increase the posterior probability of TIA to 10%. Her risk factors including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and smoking further increase the probability of a TIA to 30%. The right-sided carotid bruit heard on examination increases the probability of a TIA to about 45%, as this indicates possible carotid artery disease, a common source of emboli leading to TIAs. Additionally, her symptoms resolved completely in less than an hour, a characteristic finding in TIA, pushing the probability to approximately 70%. Her CT scan is negative, which is common in TIA as changes often do not appear on imaging until several hours after onset. This raises the likelihood of TIA to about 85%. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is a transient ischemic attack.",Transient ischemic attack,Y
"A previously healthy 15-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 24 hours after the onset of a severe headache.

What is the most likely causal pathogen?""",Herpes simplex virus,Borrelia burgdorferi,N,Naegleria fowleri,N,West Nile virus,N,Bacterial meningitis,N,Viral meningitis,N,,"This patient's severe headache, altered mental status, hyperreflexia, and extensor plantar response bilaterally, in the setting of a recent freshwater exposure during a camping trip, are highly suggestive of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM is a rare but typically fatal central nervous system infection caused by the free-living ameba Naegleria fowleri. This amoeba is typically found in warm freshwater environments, such as lakes and hot springs. The disease usually occurs after swimming or other freshwater activities that result in water going up the nose, allowing the amoeba to invade the brain via the olfactory nerve. The MRI findings of asymmetrical bitemporal hyperintensities are also in line with PAM. Hence, considering the patient's symptoms, the nature of her exposure, and the neuroradiological findings, Naegleria fowleri is the most likely pathogen in this case.",Naegleria fowleri,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes meningitis (bacterial, viral, or fungal), encephalitis, and other infections caused by various parasites or bacteria that can be associated with freshwater exposure. However, her recent exposure to freshwater environments, coupled with her symptoms of headache, agitation, disorientation, hyperreflexia, and the MRI findings of asymmetrical bitemporal hyperintensities, suggest a possible infection with Naegleria fowleri. This amoeba causes primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare and often fatal disease. The findings from the cerebrospinal fluid analysis with slightly elevated protein, normal glucose, and predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis can also be consistent with an infection of this type. Additionally, N. fowleri infections typically occur in warm freshwater environments, such as lakes and hot springs, and can occur after swimming or diving, particularly when water is forced up the nose. Considering her history and presenting symptoms, Naegleria fowleri is the most likely pathogen.",Naegleria fowleri,N,"The patient's recent history of a camping trip with spelunking and swimming in a freshwater lake, in conjunction with her symptoms, which include severe headache, agitation, hyperreflexia, and an extensor plantar response bilaterally, suggest a central nervous system infection. The MRI findings of asymmetrical, bitemporal hyperintensities suggest encephalitis rather than meningitis, given the involvement of brain parenchyma. The cerebrospinal fluid findings of mildly elevated protein and lymphocytic pleocytosis also align with a viral cause of encephalitis. Among viruses, the Naegleria fowleri is notable for its association with freshwater exposure, particularly in warm water, and for causing primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a severe and often fatal brain infection. The rapid onset and severity of symptoms in this previously healthy girl are also typical of infections with this free-living ameba.",Naegleria fowleri,N,"The patient's recent history of a camping trip that included spelunking and swimming in a freshwater lake is crucial to the diagnosis. The presence of severe headache, agitation, and neurological abnormalities, combined with the findings of bitemporal hyperintensities on the brain MRI, point towards encephalitis. The particular nature of the activities she was involved in suggest the causative agent to be Naegleria fowleri, an amoeba that is found in warm freshwater and soil, and is well known to cause Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). This organism infects individuals when contaminated water enters the nose, typically during activities like swimming or diving, and travels to the brain along the olfactory nerve, causing rapid, severe inflammation and destruction of brain tissue. The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) findings in PAM can be variable, but often show a predominance of lymphocytes, and can also have a mild increase in protein, as seen in this case.",Naegleria fowleri,N,"The prior probability of Naegleria fowleri as the causal pathogen is about 1%, given that it is a rare cause of infection. However, the patient's history of recent freshwater swimming during a camping trip significantly raises this probability. Naegleria fowleri is often found in warm freshwater bodies like lakes and hot springs, and typically infects people when contaminated water enters the nose. This raises the posterior probability of Naegleria fowleri to about 30%.

The presence of severe headache and the change in mental status (agitation, uncooperativeness, disorientation) is also a key symptom of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by Naegleria fowleri, which would raise the probability further to 50%.

The presence of diffuse hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, and the findings on the MRI showing bitemporal hyperintensities are all consistent with a CNS infection, which would further raise the probability to about 70%.

Lastly, the cerebrospinal fluid findings showing an elevated protein level and lymphocytic predominance are also consistent with the inflammation associated with Naegleria fowleri infection, bringing the posterior probability up to about 90%.",Naegleria fowleri,N

Women are at higher risk than men, and the condition usually begins between ages 20 and 40, so this raises the probability to approximately 5%. Her symptom of intermittent buzzing (tinnitus) is very common in otosclerosis, raising the probability further to approximately 15%. Her symptom of mild, spontaneous bouts of dizziness also aligns with the symptomatology of otosclerosis, further raising the probability to about 30%. The definitive clue, however, is the audiometric examination. Otosclerosis typically presents with bone conduction greater than air conduction, which can be confirmed with a Weber and Rinne test. This patient's hearing test results align with otosclerosis, raising the probability to 75%. Given these features, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is otosclerosis.",Otosclerosis,Y
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of easy bruising for several months. Minor trauma also causes scratches that bleed.

The patient's progressive muscle weakness, low energy, and weight loss are common symptoms in both multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but the symptom of pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, and pain in his feet, which suggests peripheral neuropathy, is more commonly associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Also, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is characterized by elevated levels of IgM antibodies, as seen in this patient.

Multiple myeloma often causes hypercalcemia, which is not evident in this patient (his calcium levels are normal).

The physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress with an increased respiratory rate, decreased oxygen saturation, intercostal and supraclavicular retractions, and expiratory wheezes on auscultation. These symptoms suggest a respiratory infection. Given the patient's age, the most common organism causing this presentation of a lower respiratory tract infection (potentially bronchiolitis) in an infant less than 3 months old is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).",Respiratory syncytial virus,Y,"The primary differential diagnosis for a six-week-old infant presenting with these symptoms could include several respiratory pathogens such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus. Other non-respiratory pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus and E.coli may also cause these symptoms. However, in infants, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, especially during the winter months.

This patient has fever, respiratory distress with nasal flaring, retractions, and wheezing which are indicative of a lower respiratory tract infection. The age of the infant also supports the diagnosis of RSV infection. RSV typically presents between 2 weeks and 6 months of age with peak severity at about 6 weeks of age, which is the age of the infant in question. Although the mother is a carrier of cystic fibrosis, the patient's symptoms are acute in nature, which makes a genetic disorder like cystic fibrosis less likely in this scenario.",Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV),Y,"The patient is a 6-week-old infant who presents with fever, fatigue, dry cough, poor feeding, reduced diaper changes (indicating decreased urination), nasal congestion, and respiratory distress (evidenced by tachypnea, intercostal and supraclavicular retractions, and expiratory wheezes). These symptoms indicate a severe respiratory infection. The most common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants of this age is the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). The signs of respiratory distress and the age of the patient make RSV the most probable cause.",Respiratory Syncytial Virus,Y,"The patient is a 6-week-old infant presenting with fever, fatigue, dry cough, poor feeding, and reduced urine output, all signs suggestive of a respiratory infection. The age of the patient is significant as certain organisms are more common in specific age groups. In a 6-week-old infant, the most common pathogens for respiratory infections are viruses, especially Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). However, given the signs of severe illness like lethargy, irritability, dry mucous membranes, and the presence of intercostal and supraclavicular retractions, it is more likely to be a bacterial infection. Furthermore, expiratory wheezes might suggest lower airway involvement such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia. One of the most common bacterial organisms causing pneumonia in infants is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Nevertheless, the child's mother is a known carrier of cystic fibrosis (CF). Infants with CF have abnormally thick mucus in the lungs, which can trap bacteria and lead to repeated, serious lung infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common organism seen in CF patients and could also be a likely causal organism in this case.",Pseudomonas aeruginosa,N,"In Bayesian inference, we start with a prior probability, then use the evidence to calculate a posterior probability.

In this scenario, we have a 6-week-old infant presenting with fever, fatigue, dry cough, feeding difficulty, and nasal congestion. Given her symptoms and her age, we could start with a prior probability of a respiratory tract infection caused by a variety of common organisms such as RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus), rhinovirus, influenza, and others. These are common causes of respiratory illnesses in infants, particularly in the early weeks of life. However, each has a different likelihood. For example, in a previously healthy infant, RSV is more common than the other viruses, let's say the prior probability is 50%.

The symptom of wheezing in infants is often associated with RSV infections. So the presence of wheezing increases the posterior probability of RSV being the causal organism, let's say to 65%.

Furthermore, the presence of severe symptoms such as lethargy, and the fact that the infant is not thriving (with the mother's report of fewer diapers) could suggest a more serious infection which again favors RSV, as it often causes more severe symptoms in infants than other common viruses. This could increase the probability of RSV being the causal organism further, let's say to 80%.

This step-by-step application of Bayesian inference suggests that the most likely cause of the infant's symptoms is an RSV infection.",Respiratory Syncytial Virus,Y

Because her condition was deemed not urgent, she was informed that she was down on the surgical waiting list. Despite this, she continues to visit the clinic and the ED worried that her bowels are ‘trapped and dying.’ Each time she is reassured and any protrusion present is quickly reduced.

Starting with the physical symptoms, the patient's hernia has been repetitively evaluated and easily reduced, which makes it unlikely that it is incarcerated. IBS is a possibility given her complaints of inconsistent bowel habits and abdominal pain, however, the fact that her symptoms persist despite reassurance and are associated with significant distress and worry about having a serious disease pushes us to consider psychological causes.

Moving to psychological causes, the patient shows signs of excessive worry about her health, even after being reassured by medical professionals, which is a hallmark of illness anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder can both present with physical symptoms, but in somatic symptom disorder, the focus is more on the physical sensations themselves rather than worry about having a specific serious disease. In a general anxiety disorder, the anxiety and worry are not confined to concerns about only one's health but extend to various aspects of one's life.

The worrying in illness anxiety disorder is difficult to alleviate with reassurance or medical information and typically persists for more than six months.",Illness anxiety disorder,N,"The patient presents with a history of frequent healthcare visits for seemingly minor or nonexistent issues. Her repeated complaints of abdominal pain and bowel irregularity, despite negative findings, and constant worry about her hernia being incarcerated, suggest a pattern of excessive preoccupation with her health and potential disease.

Furthermore, her memory loss is not related to delirium or another mental disorder because she is alert and oriented to person and place, albeit not time.

It has been progressing over a two year period, which is consistent with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder rather than a sudden event like a stroke. These symptoms fit the profile of Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia. The patient is also in the age group (over 65 years) that is at greatest risk for Alzheimer's.",Alzheimer's disease,Y,"This patient presents with cognitive decline that has been progressive over the last two years, characterized by memory loss, which is evident from her frequent misplacing of keys and forgetting her dog's name or phone number. This provides an initial suspicion of a degenerative cognitive disorder. Given her age, Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common conditions to consider, providing a prior probability. This prior probability can be estimated to be around 10% as Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in individuals over the age of 65.

The fact that her memory loss has been progressively worsening, demonstrated by her increasing forgetfulness about daily events or television shows she's watched, increases the probability of Alzheimer's disease, let's say to 25%.

The fact that she got lost on her usual walking route, an example of getting lost in familiar surroundings, suggests spatial disorientation, a common feature in Alzheimer's disease. This increases the probability of Alzheimer's disease to 45%.

Her son's intervention to stop her from cooking due to her forgetting to turn off the gas stove indicates issues with executive functioning, another feature of Alzheimer's disease. This could increase the probability to 60%.

Her lack of awareness about her condition and her agitation when questioned directly suggests anosognosia, a symptom often seen in Alzheimer's patients, thus further increasing the probability of Alzheimer's to 80%.

Finally, her speech difficulties, characterized by normal rhythm but frequent pauses to find the right words, suggest language difficulties, another common symptom of Alzheimer's disease. This, combined with her inability to perform serial sevens and impaired clock drawing (indicative of impaired executive function), would increase the posterior probability of Alzheimer's disease to 90%.

In conclusion, given her progressive memory loss, spatial disorientation, executive function impairment, lack of awareness about her condition (anosognosia), and language difficulties, the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's disease,Y
"A 5-year-old is brought into your office by his mother. His mother states that he is having 10-20 episodes per day where he stops responding to his mother and is found staring out of the window. During these periods, he blinks more frequently than normal, but returns to his normal self afterwards. These episodes last 30 to 60 seconds. His mother states that all of his milestones have been normal and he had an uncomplicated birth. His mother also denies any other recent illness. On exam, his vitals are normal. During one of these episodes in the office, his EEG shows three-per-second spike and wave discharge.

These episodes are brief, lasting 30 to 60 seconds. This description is suggestive of absence seizures, which are a type of generalized seizure commonly seen in children. The EEG findings of three-per-second spike and wave discharges are characteristic of absence seizures. Therefore, given the patient's symptoms and the EEG findings, the most likely diagnosis is absence seizures.",Absence seizures,Y,"The differential for this child includes: absence (petit mal) seizures, complex partial seizures, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), daydreaming, and psychiatric disorders. The episodes of staring, increased blink rate, the duration of each episode, and the frequency of these episodes per day, along with a normal history and exam, strongly suggest a seizure disorder rather than daydreaming, ADHD or a psychiatric disorder. Complex partial seizures could cause similar symptoms, but they often last longer and are associated with automatisms, which aren't present in this case. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showing a three-per-second spike and wave discharge is characteristic of absence seizures. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an absence seizure.",Absence seizure,Y,"The child in the scenario presents with episodes of unresponsiveness, frequent blinking, and staring, each lasting from 30 to 60 seconds. His mother mentions that he is otherwise healthy and had a normal birth and developmental milestones. The EEG showing three-per-second spike and wave discharges during an episode is characteristic of absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures. These are common in children and typically involve brief, sudden lapses of consciousness.",Absence seizures,Y,"This patient is demonstrating episodes of absence seizures, a form of generalized seizures which are common in children. The key symptoms are brief, often subtle periods of staring or unresponsiveness, during which routine activities may stop. They often involve minor automatisms such as eye blinking, as noted in this case. Absence seizures are typically short, lasting only a few seconds to under a minute, and the individual quickly returns to their baseline level of awareness afterwards, with no memory of the event. Importantly, the electroencephalogram (EEG) during these events characteristically shows a three-per-second spike and wave discharge pattern, which confirms the diagnosis.",Absence seizures,Y,"The prior probability of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) in a random child is low, but the provided clinical symptoms are quite specific. Starting from an initial prior probability of perhaps 1%, the episodes of staring, unresponsiveness, and blinking increase the posterior probability to perhaps 30%. The frequency and duration of these episodes, in the absence of any other neurologic findings or history of significant recent illness, further increase the posterior probability to perhaps 60%. His normal milestones and uncomplicated birth suggest a benign and not severely disabling disorder, again increasing the posterior probability to perhaps 75%. Finally, the finding of three-per-second spike-and-wave discharges on EEG during an episode is almost pathognomonic, taking the posterior probability up to perhaps 98% or more. This child most likely has childhood absence epilepsy.",Childhood absence epilepsy,N
"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for fatigue. This has persisted for the past several months and has been steadily worsening. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes; however, he is not currently taking any medications and does not frequently visit his physician. The patient has lost 20 pounds since his last visit. His laboratory values are shown below:

Hemoglobin: 9 g/dL
Hematocrit: 29%
Mean corpuscular volume: 90 µm^3

He has presented with chronic fatigue and significant weight loss. The key findings from the lab results include a decreased hemoglobin level (9 g/dL), indicating anemia, and a high calcium level (11.8 mg/dL), which is hypercalcemia. These findings suggest a systemic disease. The presence of anemia, fatigue, weight loss, and hypercalcemia are commonly seen in malignancies, particularly in cancers that may affect the bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma. Therefore, given the patient's age, history, and clinical presentation, multiple myeloma is a likely diagnosis.",Multiple myeloma,Y,"The differential for this patient includes chronic disease/anemia of chronic disease, nutritional deficiencies (such as iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency), hemolysis, bleeding, malignancy, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Given his age, the lack of specific signs of hemolysis (e.g., jaundice, high lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin), absence of signs of significant bleeding, and lack of specific signs pointing towards nutritional deficiencies (e.g., low mean corpuscular volume in iron deficiency, neurological symptoms in B12 deficiency), malignancy becomes a significant concern. The history of unintentional weight loss and fatigue further increases this suspicion. The elevated calcium level in his serum also raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancy, as hypercalcemia is commonly seen in certain cancers, including lung, breast, kidney, and multiple myeloma. Given the lack of more specific symptoms, we might suspect a type of cancer that can often present with non-specific symptoms like fatigue and weight loss, as well as paraneoplastic hypercalcemia. Therefore, in this case, the most likely diagnosis would be malignancy, with the type yet to be determined, but possibly something like lung cancer or multiple myeloma.",Undiagnosed Malignancy,Y,"This patient has fatigue, unexplained weight loss, and a high serum calcium level. In an elderly patient with these symptoms, a likely diagnosis could be malignancy. High calcium levels are often seen in malignancies due to paraneoplastic syndromes, wherein tumor cells release parathyroid hormone-related peptide, leading to bone resorption and increased serum calcium. The patient also has anemia (hemoglobin: 9 g/dL), which is common in chronic diseases including malignancies. Given this combination of symptoms, one possible diagnosis could be a type of malignancy such as multiple myeloma or lung cancer.",Cancer (Malignancy),Y,"The patient is presenting with fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels). Given his age and these symptoms, one must be concerned about malignancy. The elevated calcium level further raises suspicion for a malignancy as hypercalcemia can occur in certain types of cancers due to paraneoplastic phenomena where tumor cells secrete parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) that increases calcium levels in the body. Common malignancies associated with hypercalcemia include lung, breast, renal, and multiple myeloma. Therefore, given the symptoms and hypercalcemia, the patient likely has an underlying malignancy.",Malignancy,Y,"The prior probability of a malignancy, such as multiple myeloma in an individual of this age with no other given risk factors, is relatively low, about 1%. However, the weight loss he has experienced, which is unexplained and significant (20 pounds), increases the posterior probability to approximately 10%. The presence of fatigue, a common symptom in multiple myeloma, further raises this to about 25%. This alone might be indicative of a variety of conditions, but when considering the laboratory findings, the probability changes. The decreased hemoglobin, or anemia, is a common finding in multiple myeloma and increases the probability to about 50%. The clinching factor here, though, is the elevated calcium level. Hypercalcemia is a common paraneoplastic syndrome seen in multiple myeloma, which can raise the probability up to approximately 85-90%. This patient most likely has multiple myeloma.",Multiple myeloma,Y
"A 60-year-old male comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of intermittent shortness of breath and palpitations. The episodes are unprovoked and occur randomly. The day before, he felt lightheaded while walking and had to sit down abruptly to keep from passing out. He has hypertension and coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization 5 years ago showed occlusion of the left anterior descending artery, and he underwent placement of a stent. Current medications include aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and clopidogrel. He does not drink alcohol or use any illicit drugs. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He appears well. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 136/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/85 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation.

His current vitals show a rapid, irregular pulse, which further supports a cardiac problem. Given the history of coronary artery disease and stent placement, along with the symptoms of irregular, rapid heartbeat, the most likely diagnosis would be atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm disorder, especially in those with a history of heart disease, and it can cause symptoms of palpitations, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness, as in this patient.",Atrial Fibrillation,N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient includes: arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia), coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism.

The symptoms of intermittent shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling lightheaded are indicative of cardiac abnormalities, likely related to rhythm disturbances. The rapid, irregular rhythm on cardiac examination further strengthens the possibility of an arrhythmia. Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease, he is at increased risk for developing arrhythmias.

Among the various types of arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm and could cause the patient's symptoms. Supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia typically have a regular rhythm and are less likely.

Atrial flutter could also present with an irregular rhythm but is less common than atrial fibrillation. Acute myocardial infarction could also cause these symptoms but is less likely given the patient's presentation and the fact that his symptoms have been present for several days.

Heart failure could theoretically cause shortness of breath and palpitations but the patient's presentation with a rapid, irregular rhythm and the lack of other signs of heart failure (such as pulmonary edema or peripheral edema) make it less likely. Pulmonary embolism could cause shortness of breath and tachycardia, but it does not typically present with an irregular rhythm.

Given the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is atrial fibrillation.",Atrial fibrillation,N,"The patient presents with shortness of breath, palpitations, and lightheadedness. These are common symptoms of arrhythmias. The physical examination indicates a rapid, irregular rhythm which is a typical finding in atrial fibrillation. This condition is even more likely given his history of hypertension and coronary artery disease, as these conditions can lead to left atrial enlargement and are recognized risk factors for atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is atrial fibrillation.",Atrial fibrillation,N,"The patient's intermittent shortness of breath, palpitations, and lightheadedness along with the rapid, irregular rhythm on cardiac examination suggest an arrhythmia. Given the patient's history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and smoking, he has multiple risk factors for atrial fibrillation (AF), which is the most common type of arrhythmia. In AF, the normal rhythmic contractions of the atria become chaotic and irregular, leading to an irregularly irregular pulse, as is found in this patient. AF can also cause symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness, due to decreased cardiac output and rapid ventricular response. While there are other causes for arrhythmias, given the patient's history and presentation, AF is the most likely cause.",Atrial Fibrillation,N,"The prior probability of atrial fibrillation (AFib) for a 60-year-old male patient with hypertension and coronary artery disease could be roughly estimated around 10%. Symptoms such as intermittent shortness of breath, palpitations, and feeling lightheaded during physical activity raise the probability of AFib to approximately 25%. The presence of a rapid, irregular rhythm on the cardiac examination further raises the posterior probability of AFib to about 75%. Considering the background history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and his long-term smoking habit, the posterior probability of AFib is further increased to approximately 90%.

The elevated platelet count can also be associated with inflammatory states. The presence of erythematous nodules and weak radial and pedal pulses are key clues to the diagnosis. This presentation is suggestive of an autoimmune vasculitis, in particular, polyarteritis nodosa, which is associated with symptoms of systemic inflammation, and can cause nodules and weaken peripheral pulses due to the inflammation of medium-sized vessels.",Polyarteritis nodosa,N,"The differential for this patient includes: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or infectious arthritis. The presence of night sweats, malaise, elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), anemia, and thrombocytosis (high platelet count) point towards a systemic illness. The presence of weak radial and pedal pulses and the erythematous nodules on the legs suggest some form of vasculitis. Among the types of vasculitis, Takayasu arteritis could explain these findings, including the weak pulses (due to inflammation and narrowing of large vessels such as the aorta and its primary branches) and nodules (which could represent erythema nodosum, a type of panniculitis seen in inflammatory conditions including vasculitis).

A key clue to the diagnosis is the presence of weak radial and pedal pulses, suggesting vascular involvement. The condition that links all these findings is Takayasu arteritis, a large-vessel vasculitis that primarily affects the aorta and its major branches. The inflammation causes wall thickening, fibrosis, and stenosis, leading to decreased pulses in the affected vessels. Other clinical findings may include constitutional symptoms and polymyalgia.

The ultrasound findings of a dilated common bile duct and multiple gallstones without evidence of cholecystitis (no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid) suggest a gallstone has migrated from the gallbladder and is obstructing the common bile duct, resulting in choledocholithiasis. This obstruction leads to a backup of bile into the liver, causing the observed symptoms and lab abnormalities.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, and cholangitis.

She has episodes of severe, sharp, right upper quadrant pain associated with nausea and vomiting, consistent with biliary colic, but this is usually not associated with changes in liver function tests (LFTs) unless there is associated cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, or cholangitis.

The patient does not have fever, rebound tenderness, or other signs of peritonitis that would suggest acute cholecystitis. Abdominal ultrasound shows a dilated common bile duct and multiple gallstones, but no gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid which are indicative of acute cholecystitis.

Choledocholithiasis (stone in the common bile duct) can present with similar symptoms and can cause dilation of the common bile duct, but would typically cause fluctuating jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools, which are not present in this case.

The laboratory studies show a high total bilirubin and elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase), which are more consistent with a post-hepatic cause of jaundice, such as choledocholithiasis or cholangitis. However, the patient does not have fever, leukocytosis, or other systemic signs of infection which would typically be present in cholangitis.

Therefore, the patient's episodes of right upper quadrant pain, the ultrasound findings of a dilated common bile duct and gallstones, and the elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes, all suggest the most likely diagnosis is choledocholithiasis.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"This patient presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, mild scleral icterus, and elevated liver enzymes, which are all suggestive of a biliary tract obstruction. Her history of terminal ileum resection for Crohn's disease is significant because it increases her risk of developing gallstones due to impaired reabsorption of bile salts. The ultrasonography findings show a dilated common bile duct and the presence of multiple gallstones, which confirm the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis, which is obstruction of the common bile duct by gallstones. The absence of wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid makes acute cholecystitis less likely.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"The patient's history of Crohn's disease with resection of the terminal ileum, combined with her elevated BMI, places her at an increased risk for the development of gallstones. The severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant accompanied by nausea and vomiting suggests biliary colic, which is caused by the contraction of the gallbladder against a stone lodged in the cystic duct. The increased total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT, along with the ultrasound finding of a dilated common bile duct, suggest obstruction and inflammation caused by a stone, known as choledocholithiasis. This is further supported by the mild scleral icterus (a sign of increased bilirubin). Although the patient has multiple gallstones, the lack of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid makes acute cholecystitis less likely.",Choledocholithiasis,Y,"The prior probability of choledocholithiasis in this patient could be estimated to be around 5%, given her age and history of Crohn's disease, which has been associated with gallstone disease. However, this probability is increased when we take into consideration the following findings:

The patient's symptoms of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant accompanied by nausea and vomiting can be characteristic of biliary colic, which is common in choledocholithiasis. This could raise the posterior probability to around 30%.

The physical exam showed scleral icterus and tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant. These findings are consistent with choledocholithiasis and can further increase the posterior probability to about 60%.

Laboratory findings show elevated total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST and ALT, all of which are common in biliary obstruction caused by choledocholithiasis. This could bring the posterior probability up to around 80%.

Finally, the abdominal ultrasonography showed a common bile duct of increased caliber (10mm vs normal of <6mm) and multiple gallstones in the gallbladder but no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. This further strengthens the likelihood of choledocholithiasis, increasing the posterior probability to a level well above 90%.",Choledocholithiasis,Y

She has had chronic lymphedema of the right upper extremity since the mastectomy. Her only medication is simvastatin. She lives in an assisted living facility. She is content with her living arrangement but feels guilty that she is dependent on others. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows extensive edema of the right arm.

It is a very aggressive neoplasm that often presents as multiple red to purple nodules or plaques that can progress to ulceration.",Stewart-Treves syndrome,Y,"This patient's longstanding lymphedema after a radical mastectomy represents a classic setup for the development of Stewart-Treves syndrome, which is angiosarcoma arising within the area of chronic lymphedema. Chronic lymphedema results in stasis of lymph and an immunocompromised environment which predisposes to the development of malignancy. The clinical presentation is typically a rapidly enlarging, purple or erythematous, nonhealing, multifocal plaque or nodule in an area of lymphedema. This patient's presentation of purple-colored plaques with associated ulceration in an area of chronic lymphedema is consistent with this diagnosis.",Stewart-Treves syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is relatively low in the general population, but in the setting of chronic lymphedema, it significantly increases. Chronic lymphedema is a known risk factor for developing Kaposi's sarcoma, also known as Stewart-Treves syndrome, which would increase the posterior probability to about 15%. The patient presents with typical KS lesions (purple-colored plaques), which would increase the probability further to around 40%. Furthermore, the fact that these lesions are localized to the area of chronic lymphedema (the right arm) increases the probability of KS to around 60%. Given these features, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is Kaposi's sarcoma.",Kaposi's sarcoma,Y
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. She states that the pain has been dull and progressive, but became suddenly worse while she was exercising. The patient's past medical history is notable for depression, anxiety, and gonococcal urethritis that was appropriately treated. The patient states that she is sexually active and does not use condoms. She admits to drinking at least 5 standard alcoholic drinks a day. The patient also recently lost a large amount of weight for a fitness show she planned on entering. The patient's current medications include oral contraceptive pills, fluoxetine, alprazolam, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and folate. On physical exam you note an athletic young woman with burly shoulders, a thick neck, and acne on her forehead and back.

These signs point towards an acute surgical abdomen condition. The patient's recent weight loss, significant alcohol consumption, and use of oral contraceptives (which can increase the risk of gallstones) suggest gallbladder disease. However, the severe pain and hypotension may suggest a more severe complication, such as gallbladder rupture or perforation. Additionally, her muscular build, acne, and use of fluoxetine (which could be used to manage mood symptoms related to anabolic steroid use) raise suspicion of potential anabolic steroid use, which could increase the risk of gallbladder disease.",Gallbladder perforation,N,"The differential for this patient includes: appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), cholecystitis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, and hepatic disease. Her severe, sudden-onset right upper quadrant pain could suggest cholecystitis or hepatitis. The heavy alcohol use could also suggest alcoholic hepatitis or pancreatitis.

The presence of burly shoulders, a thick neck, and acne could suggest anabolic steroid use, which can cause liver injury. Moreover, her recent weight loss and intensive exercise regimen (common in those who use performance-enhancing drugs) can contribute to the possibility of steroid use. Her low blood pressure and tachycardia might suggest shock from internal bleeding, potentially from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or from liver failure. The negative urinary hCG would rule out ectopic pregnancy.

Given her recent rapid weight loss, intense exercise regimen, possible anabolic steroid use, heavy alcohol use, and severe right upper quadrant pain, the most likely diagnosis is a liver-related condition, possibly anabolic steroid-induced liver injury or alcoholic hepatitis.",Liver injury,N,"The patient presents with signs of severe abdominal pain, especially right upper quadrant pain, and hypotension. These signs, together with her history of excessive alcohol consumption, unprotected sex, use of oral contraceptives and sudden weight loss, point towards acute hepatic injury or hepatitis. The patient's use of alcohol and oral contraceptives are both known to cause hepatic injury, either directly or through hepatotoxic metabolites. Moreover, the patient's history of unprotected sex and gonococcal urethritis make her at risk for sexually transmitted infections that can cause hepatitis, such as Hepatitis B and C. The recent weight loss may also have stressed her liver, exacerbating the condition.",Acute Hepatitis,N,"This patient's presentation with severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, along with her low blood pressure and elevated pulse, suggest an acute abdominal event. Her significant alcohol intake and rapid weight loss predispose her to gallbladder pathology. Furthermore, the use of oral contraceptive pills could also contribute to the risk of gallstone formation. Acute cholecystitis is a condition caused by inflammation of the gallbladder, most commonly due to obstruction of the cystic duct by gallstones. Her history of recent weight loss and high alcohol intake are also risk factors for acute pancreatitis, but the localization of her pain to the right upper quadrant is more suggestive of gallbladder disease. Her masculine features (burly shoulders, thick neck) and acne could indicate anabolic steroid use, which is common in fitness enthusiasts and is also associated with liver disease. However, the acute onset of her symptoms points to a gallbladder issue rather than chronic liver disease.",Acute cholecystitis,N,"The initial or prior probability of an ectopic pregnancy in a sexually active woman of childbearing age is about 2%. The patient's symptoms of severe and acute onset abdominal pain, especially in the context of being sexually active and not using condoms, raises the posterior probability to about 20%.

The use of an oral contraceptive also increases the risk of an ectopic pregnancy if contraceptive failure occurs, raising the posterior probability to about 40%. The patient's severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, hypotension, and tachycardia could indicate internal bleeding, which is a complication of ruptured ectopic pregnancy, pushing the probability to around 60%. In addition, her recent weight loss and frequent alcohol consumption may have affected her menstrual cycle or ovulation, potentially increasing the risk of ectopic pregnancy and raising the posterior probability to about 70%. Lastly, her thick neck and burly shoulders suggest possible steroid use, which can also impact menstrual cycles and pregnancy, raising the posterior probability to about 80%.

"A 26-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a routine physical exam. He is concerned about a burning sensation that he feels in his throat whenever he eats large meals and is concerned he may have esophageal cancer like his uncle. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. His current medications include whey protein supplements, fish oil, a multivitamin, and sodium docusate. The patient is concerned about his performance in school and fears he may fail out. He recently did poorly on an exam and it has caused him significant stress. He also is worried that his girlfriend is going to leave him. The patient claims that he thought he was going to be an incredible doctor some day, but now he feels like a terrible person. The patient also states that he feels guilty about his grandfather's death which occurred 1 year ago and he often reexperiences the funeral in his mind. He regularly has trouble sleeping for which he takes melatonin. The patient has been praying every 4 hours with the hopes that this will make things go better for him. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Generalized anxiety disorder,Major depressive disorder,N,Depression,N,Depression,N,Anxiety disorder,Y,Depression,N,,"The patient's feelings of worthlessness, guilt about his grandfather's death, recurrent thoughts about the funeral, trouble sleeping, worry about his performance in school, his relationship, and the potential for failing out all point towards psychological distress. These symptoms indicate ongoing depressive symptoms. In particular, the fact that these symptoms are affecting his sleep and causing significant distress, along with the fact that they have been going on for an extended period, suggest that they are more than just a transient response to stress. His frequent praying might be a way for him to cope with these feelings. While he does have physical symptoms such as a burning sensation in his throat when he eats large meals, this can also be a symptom of stress and anxiety, and his worry about esophageal cancer could be a manifestation of his depressive and anxious state. Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is major depressive disorder.",Major Depressive Disorder,N,"The differential for this patient includes gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), anxiety disorder, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

The patient's physical symptoms of a burning sensation in his throat after large meals could be suggestive of GERD. However, there seems to be a significant component of psychological distress as well.

He's expressing intense fears about his future, concerns about his relationship, guilt about his grandfather's death, frequent reexperiencing of a traumatic event (the funeral), trouble sleeping, and repetitive praying behaviors. His intense guilt, hopelessness, and negative self-view suggest a mood disorder, and his reexperiencing the funeral could suggest PTSD.

However, these symptoms also align with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. His intense guilt about his grandfather's death, persistent feelings of worthlessness, and disturbed sleep are classic symptoms of depression. The DSM-5, a widely accepted diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders, indicates that at least 5 symptoms (including at least one of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure) must be present during the same 2-week period for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. This patient's symptoms span across affective, cognitive, and somatic realms and appear to be causing him significant distress, thereby satisfying these criteria.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Major Depressive Disorder.",Major Depressive Disorder,N,"This patient's presentation is suggestive of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The symptoms of MDD as per the DSM-5 include depressed mood, anhedonia, significant weight change or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, impaired concentration or indecisiveness, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. This patient presents with depressed mood (feels like a terrible person), feelings of worthlessness (worried about failing school), excessive guilt (about grandfather's death), insomnia (trouble sleeping), and impaired concentration (did poorly on an exam). These symptoms appear to be affecting his daily functioning, and have been present for at least two weeks. His praying behavior might also reflect a possible attempt to cope with these symptoms, rather than an indication of a specific religious or spiritual practice.",Major Depressive Disorder,N,"This patient exhibits several signs and symptoms that fit with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD is characterized by a period of at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood, most of the day, nearly every day, or loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities. This patient shows a depressed mood as evidenced by his guilt about his grandfather's death, fear of failure in school, concerns about his relationship, and low self-esteem (""feels like a terrible person""). In addition, he experiences sleep disturbances, a common symptom of MDD. The patient's excessive guilt, recurrent thoughts about a past traumatic event, and changes in sleep patterns are additional key features of MDD. It's important to note that the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, as seen with this patient. Furthermore, this patient doesn't appear to have a history of a manic or hypomanic episode, which might suggest bipolar disorder. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is major depressive disorder.",Major Depressive Disorder,N,"The Bayesian inference process requires us to start with a prior probability, consider the likelihood of certain evidence given different conditions, and then calculate a posterior probability that will provide the best answer.

Let's start with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The prior probability of MDD in the general population is about 7% (according to data available up to my knowledge cutoff in September 2021).

The patient exhibits several key symptoms of MDD, including persistent sadness or low mood, a marked decrease in interest or pleasure in activities (anhedonia), feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Each symptom can increase the probability of MDD.

Significant stress and fear of failure: Stressful life events can trigger depressive episodes. This increases the posterior probability to around 15%.
Feelings of worthlessness and guilt: Common symptoms in MDD. This can increase the posterior probability to 30%.
Re-experiencing traumatic events: This can be interpreted as a symptom of a mood disorder, raising the probability to 40%.
Sleep disturbance: This is another common symptom of MDD, raising the probability to 50%.
He prays every four hours, perhaps indicating a desperate attempt to feel better, which might increase the probability to 55%.
Considering all these symptoms, the posterior probability of Major Depressive Disorder is high, making it the most likely diagnosis.",Major Depressive Disorder,N
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the clinic with an abnormal sensation on the left side of her body that has been present for the past several months. At first, the area seemed numb and she recalls touching a hot stove and accidentally burning herself but not feeling the heat. Now she is suffering from a constant, uncomfortable burning pain on her left side for the past week. The pain gets worse when someone even lightly touches that side. She has recently immigrated and her past medical records are unavailable. Last month she had a stroke but she cannot recall any details from the event. She confirms a history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and bilateral knee pain. She also had cardiac surgery 20 years ago. She denies fever, mood changes, weight changes, and trauma to the head, neck, or limbs. Her blood pressure is 162/90 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. Multiple old burn marks are visible on the left hand and forearm. Muscle strength is mildly reduced in the left upper and lower limbs. Hyperesthesia is noted in the left upper and lower limbs.

This distribution of sensory changes and the history of a recent stroke suggest the patient likely has central post-stroke pain (CPSP), also known as thalamic pain syndrome or Dejerine-Roussy syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a lesion within the central nervous system, often a stroke, that affects the spinothalamic tract. Symptoms usually present several months following the stroke, which fits this patient's timeline. The hemibody distribution, initial numbness followed by pain, and heightened sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia) are characteristic. The reduced muscle strength in the affected limbs can also be attributed to the stroke.",Central Post-Stroke Pain,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes central post-stroke pain syndrome (CPSP), peripheral neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, or multiple sclerosis. Her history of stroke, along with the symptoms of altered sensation and pain on one side of her body, suggests CPSP. The timing of her symptoms is also indicative; CPSP often develops weeks to months after a stroke, and the area initially feels numb but later develops into a constant burning pain. Peripheral neuropathy typically manifests as a stocking-glove distribution and is unlikely to affect only one side of the body. Multiple sclerosis would often present with a wider range of neurological symptoms and the patient's age is not typical for a new diagnosis. Complex regional pain syndrome usually follows trauma or surgery, which the patient denies. Based on these considerations, the most likely diagnosis is central post-stroke pain syndrome.",Central Post-Stroke Pain Syndrome,Y,"This patient's presenting symptoms of an abnormal sensation on one side of her body, initially presenting as numbness leading to a burning pain and hyperesthesia, indicate a neurological disorder. Given the history of a recent stroke and the fact that her symptoms are contralateral (opposite side of the body from the brain lesion), it is plausible that she has developed a condition known as thalamic pain syndrome, or Dejerine-Roussy syndrome. This condition is a type of central post-stroke pain that occurs after a lesion, usually infarct, in the thalamus. Symptoms often begin as a mild sensory loss, followed by persistent pain that is often triggered by light touch (allodynia). Muscle strength may also be reduced in the affected limbs, as indicated in this case. Lab values do not indicate any other causative disorders, such as Vitamin B12 deficiency or hypothyroidism.",Dejerine-Roussy syndrome,Y,"This patient presents with pain and sensory abnormalities (numbness evolving to constant burning pain and hyperesthesia) on one side of her body, which is indicative of central post-stroke pain syndrome (CPSP), previously termed thalamic pain syndrome. CPSP occurs secondary to a stroke, and is characterized by sensory deficits followed by the onset of burning pain and hyperesthesia in the affected area. Her history of a recent stroke supports this diagnosis. The condition is thought to arise due to a lesion in the spinothalamic tract leading to altered nociceptive processing. Despite her history of type II diabetes mellitus, the distribution of her symptoms doesn't follow a peripheral nerve or dermatomal distribution, making a peripheral neuropathy less likely. Furthermore, her normal B12 levels make B12 deficiency neuropathy unlikely.",Central post-stroke pain syndrome,Y,"The prior probability of central post-stroke pain (CPSP) syndrome is around 8% among all stroke survivors. The patient's history of recent stroke can increase this to about 25%. The patient's reported loss of sensation and numbness further supports CPSP, increasing the probability to around 35%. The recent transition to constant, uncomfortable burning pain, especially with light touch, also points towards CPSP, raising the probability to around 50%. The presence of hyperesthesia (increased sensitivity to stimuli) in the left upper and lower limbs provides further evidence, leading to a posterior probability of approximately 65%. With no other apparent causes for these symptoms and given the lack of significant findings in the lab results, this patient's symptoms are most likely attributable to central post-stroke pain syndrome.",Central Post-Stroke Pain Syndrome,Y

These findings are suggestive of a pregnancy-specific liver disorder. Given the laboratory values and absence of any other significant abnormalities on physical examination or imaging, the most likely diagnosis is intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). This condition is associated with increased bile acids in the blood due to impaired bile flow (cholestasis) within the liver, often presenting with pruritus and increased serum bile acids and bilirubin, as seen in this patient.",Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Y,"This patient presents with generalized pruritus, mild scleral icterus, and elevated bile acids, which suggests a liver-related problem. Differential diagnoses could include viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), or preeclampsia with severe features. Viral hepatitis is less likely given the lack of exposure history, absence of other symptoms like malaise, and mildly elevated transaminases. Drug-induced liver injury is also less likely due to the lack of medication use. Preeclampsia with severe features often includes hypertension and proteinuria, which this patient lacks. This makes ICP the most likely diagnosis, which is confirmed by elevated serum bile acids. ICP typically presents in the second or third trimester with pruritus (particularly affecting the palms and soles), elevated serum bile acids, and mild liver function test abnormalities.",Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Y,"This patient presents with pruritus, mild scleral icterus, and increased serum bilirubin and bile acids in the third trimester of pregnancy. These are indicative of cholestasis, and in this specific context, it is likely intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is a liver disorder that typically occurs in the late second and third trimester and is characterized by pruritus and elevated serum bile acids. Abdominal pain and jaundice are less common features but when present, suggest more severe disease. Other liver diseases, such as viral hepatitis or cholecystitis, could potentially present with similar symptoms but the absence of pain, normal liver enzymes, and normal ultrasound make these diagnoses less likely.",Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Y,"This pregnant patient at 34 weeks' gestation presents with generalized pruritus, pallor, mild scleral icterus, and elevated total and direct bilirubin, which suggest cholestasis. The presence of increased bile acids further supports this. In pregnancy, the most common cause of cholestasis is intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). ICP is a pregnancy-specific liver disease, characterized by pruritus and biochemical cholestasis, including elevated bile acid levels, often without significant elevation of transaminases. The condition generally presents in the second or third trimester and resolves spontaneously after delivery. ICP is usually benign for the mother (beyond the discomfort of pruritus), but is associated with adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm birth and intrauterine fetal demise.",Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Y,"The initial (prior) probability of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) in a general pregnant population might be quite low, perhaps 1-2%, as it's not a very common condition. However, this woman has several findings that increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, shifting the posterior probability upwards.

The presence of generalized pruritus in a pregnant woman increases the probability of ICP to, say, around 15%. ICP is known for causing pruritus, particularly in the third trimester, and the absence of a rash is also a characteristic finding in ICP. Pruritus can be a common symptom in pregnancy, but when it's generalized and without rash, it could suggest ICP.

Mild jaundice (as suggested by the mild scleral icterus) could push the probability further up to 40%. In ICP, bile acids accumulate in the bloodstream and can lead to mild jaundice.

Most significantly, the laboratory studies show elevated serum bile acids, which are typically normal or low in pregnancy. This increases the probability to, say, 70%. In ICP, the bile acid levels are often elevated above the normal level, which is a hallmark of the disease. Moreover, the slightly raised bilirubin and liver enzymes (AST, ALT) could indicate some form of liver disease, which would also be consistent with ICP.

Given all these factors, this woman likely has intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy.",Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Y
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss during the last 3 months. During this period, he has complained of abdominal pain and fullness, and his parents feel that he has been eating less. His parents also report that his urine has appeared pink for several weeks. He has been performing poorly in school lately, with reports from teachers that he has not been paying attention in class and has been distracting to other students. He was born at term and has been healthy except for a history of several infantile seizures. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is at the 60th percentile for height and 20th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows a palpable abdominal mass, abdominal tenderness in the left upper quadrant, and left costovertebral angle tenderness. There are several ellipsoid, hypopigmented macules on the back and legs and a 4-cm raised plaque of rough, dimpled skin on the right lower back that is the same color as the surrounding skin. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Tuberous sclerosis,Tuberous sclerosis,Y,Tuberous sclerosis,Y,Neurofibromatosis type 1.,N,Wilms tumor,N,Tuberous Sclerosis,Y,,"This 7-year-old boy presents with significant weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal pain and fullness, and pink urine, which suggests the possibility of hematuria. These signs along with the presence of an abdominal mass and tenderness in the left upper quadrant point toward renal pathology.

Additionally, his academic performance is declining, which might be related to a possible neurocognitive issue or related to his underlying condition causing fatigue and malaise. His history of infantile seizures also adds to this possibility.

The description of multiple ellipsoid, hypopigmented macules on his back and legs, along with the raised, rough, dimpled plaque on his lower back that is the same color as the surrounding skin, is suggestive of skin manifestations known as ""ash-leaf spots"" and ""shagreen patches,"" respectively.

Combining all these clinical findings points to the diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in many different organs (brain, kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin) and is associated with a variety of dermatological, renal, and neurologic symptoms.",Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,Y,"The differential diagnosis for this child could include a range of conditions that could cause weight loss, abdominal pain, and pink urine, such as: gastrointestinal disorders, renal disorders including nephrotic syndrome and glomerulonephritis, malignancies such as Wilms' tumor or Neuroblastoma, and systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis or HIV.

However, the presence of a palpable abdominal mass and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest a kidney origin. Pink urine could be a sign of hematuria, which is common in kidney diseases. Additionally, the presence of several ellipsoid, hypopigmented macules on the back and legs, and a raised plaque of rough, dimpled skin could be indicative of the ""ash-leaf spots"" and ""shagreen patches"" respectively, which are associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC is a genetic disorder that affects multiple systems and is characterized by the growth of numerous benign tumors in different parts of the body, including the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes, and lungs.

TSC often presents with seizures in infancy, as in this child's history, and can be associated with developmental delay, behavioral problems, and renal angiomyolipomas, which could cause the abdominal pain, palpable mass, and hematuria (pink urine). This diagnosis fits all of the child's symptoms, physical findings, and past medical history.

Rationale:
Given the symptoms, physical findings, and past medical history, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.",Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,Y,"This patient's presentation of symptoms such as weight loss, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, fullness, and pink urine (indicative of hematuria) in combination with the physical findings of an abdominal mass, costovertebral angle tenderness, hypopigmented macules and a rough, dimpled skin plaque suggests a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organs. The hypopigmented macules, also known as ash leaf spots, and the rough, dimpled plaque, also known as shagreen patch, are both common cutaneous manifestations of TSC. The abdominal mass and costovertebral angle tenderness could suggest the presence of renal angiomyolipomas, which are common in TSC and can cause hematuria. Additionally, TSC is often associated with neurological symptoms, such as seizures (which this patient has a history of) and behavioral issues, including attention-deficit disorders which could explain his poor performance at school.",Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,Y,"This child is presenting with weight loss, decreased appetite, and an abdominal mass, indicative of a renal disorder. The left costovertebral angle tenderness and pink urine further suggests a nephrological condition, possibly involving bleeding in the urinary tract. The skin findings of hypopigmented macules and a rough, dimpled skin plaque are characteristic of tuberous sclerosis, a genetic disorder that can cause benign tumors to grow in many parts of the body, including the kidneys. These tumors can sometimes bleed, which might explain the pink urine. Children with tuberous sclerosis may also exhibit behavioral issues like attention deficit and hyperactivity, which is consistent with the child's school performance. Taken together, the renal and cutaneous signs and symptoms point to tuberous sclerosis as the most likely diagnosis.",Tuberous sclerosis,Y,"The prior probability of a case with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) in general population is low, approximately 1 in 6,000 births. However, given the patient's history of infantile seizures, this increases the probability to about 2%.

The presence of hypopigmented macules, also known as ""ash leaf spots,"" which are characteristic of TSC, increases the posterior probability to about 10%.

The presence of a rough, dimpled skin plaque, which could be a Shagreen patch, another characteristic of TSC, increases the posterior probability to about 40%.

Abdominal symptoms including pain and fullness along with a palpable abdominal mass and evidence of possible kidney issues (pink urine, indicating blood in urine) are suggestive of renal angiomyolipoma, a common manifestation of TSC, and further increase the probability to about 70%.

Poor performance at school and distracting behavior can also point towards cognitive and behavioral problems often associated with TSC, which increases the posterior probability to about 85%. Given this series of evidence, the patient likely has Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.",Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,Y

What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?""",Aldosteronoma,SIADH,N,Hypokalemia,N,Addison's disease,N,Adrenal insufficiency,N,Addison's Disease,N,,"This patient presents with fatigue, muscle weakness, recurrent headaches, and palpitations, symptoms that can be associated with various conditions. The history of hypertension, despite being on antihypertensive medications, is significant. Looking at the patient's laboratory results, she exhibits hypernatremia (high sodium) and hypokalemia (low potassium), indicating a disturbance in her electrolyte balance. Further, the high bicarbonate levels suggest metabolic alkalosis.

These symptoms and lab results together, particularly the combination of hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, raise the suspicion of primary hyperaldosteronism (also known as Conn's syndrome). Aldosterone leads to sodium retention (causing hypertension and hypernatremia), potassium excretion (leading to hypokalemia), and hydrogen ion excretion (leading to metabolic alkalosis). The patient's symptoms and the lab results align well with these effects of excessive aldosterone.",Primary Hyperaldosteronism,Y,"The differential diagnoses for this patient could include hyperaldosteronism, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, renal artery stenosis, and essential hypertension. The key findings in this patient are hypertension, hypokalemia (K+ 3.0 mEq/L), and metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 30 mEq/L), which are classical findings for primary hyperaldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome can also cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but it typically presents with hyperglycemia, which is not evident here. Pheochromocytoma may present with hypertension and palpitations, but it does not typically cause hypokalemia. Renal artery stenosis can cause hypertension, but it's less likely in a young patient without atherosclerotic disease and typically does not cause hypokalemia. Essential hypertension is less likely given the presence of hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, as it does not typically cause these laboratory abnormalities. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is primary hyperaldosteronism.",Primary Hyperaldosteronism,Y,"This patient's presenting symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, recurrent headaches, and palpitations. She also has hypertension, despite being relatively young and not overweight. Her lab results show hyponatremia (low sodium) and hypokalemia (low potassium), along with a slightly elevated bicarbonate level. These findings are suggestive of a hormonal abnormality, especially considering her age and non-obese status. The pattern of electrolyte disturbances and hypertension points towards Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism), a condition characterized by overproduction of aldosterone from the adrenal glands. The excess aldosterone leads to sodium retention (and therefore water retention, leading to hypertension), and potassium excretion (leading to hypokalemia). The increased bicarbonate is due to the body's attempt to compensate for the metabolic alkalosis that can result from primary hyperaldosteronism.",Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn's Syndrome),Y,"The patient's symptoms include fatigue, muscle weakness, recurrent headaches, and palpitations. She has a history of hypertension and major depressive disorder, both of which can be influenced by endocrine conditions. The lab results show a high serum sodium (hypernatremia) and low potassium (hypokalemia), and an elevated bicarbonate level, which suggests the possibility of metabolic alkalosis. These lab findings and the patient's symptoms point to an adrenal disorder, specifically primary hyperaldosteronism (also known as Conn's syndrome), a condition where the adrenal glands produce excess aldosterone. Aldosterone causes the kidneys to hold onto sodium and water, which raises blood pressure, and get rid of potassium, causing the hypokalemia. This increased sodium reabsorption can lead to hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis (due to the hydrogen ion loss that occurs when potassium is spared), which is reflected in her lab results.",Primary hyperaldosteronism,Y,"The prior probability of primary hyperaldosteronism (also known as Conn's syndrome) in a young hypertensive patient could be around 1-2%. However, the presence of resistant hypertension (despite being on both enalapril and metoprolol) increases the posterior probability of primary hyperaldosteronism to about 10-20%. The presence of hypokalemia (K+ 3.0 mEq/L) raises the probability even further, as this electrolyte abnormality is commonly seen in hyperaldosteronism due to increased renal potassium wasting; this elevates the probability to about 40-50%. High serum bicarbonate levels (HCO3- 30 mEq/L) also suggest metabolic alkalosis, which can result from primary hyperaldosteronism due to increased renal bicarbonate reabsorption; this pushes the probability even higher, possibly to about 60-70%. Other symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle weakness, may be linked to hypokalemia and further support this diagnosis. Taking into account all these findings, the patient most likely has primary hyperaldosteronism.",Primary hyperaldosteronism,Y

The jaundice indicates a likely issue with the liver or biliary system, and this is supported by the pain in the right upper quadrant, where the liver and gallbladder are located. Additionally, her laboratory results reveal a series of positive markers for Hepatitis B: surface antigen, core antigen, E antigen, core IgG, and E IgG. The presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen and E antigen suggests active viral replication. The presence of core IgG and E IgG indicates a response by the immune system. The absence of surface IgG indicates that the infection is not resolved. Therefore, this patient most likely has an acute Hepatitis B infection.",Acute Hepatitis B,N,"The differential for this patient includes acute hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis B, and acute flare of chronic hepatitis B. The patient is presenting with jaundice, abdominal pain, and tenderness over the right upper quadrant, all suggesting hepatitis. The Hepatitis B surface antigen positivity indicates an active Hepatitis B infection. The presence of Hepatitis B core IgG suggests either past or ongoing infection, as it remains positive for life following infection. Hepatitis B core antigen is not typically detected in blood tests, but its presence along with the E antigen suggests high viral replication, and hence, an active infection. Absence of Hepatitis B surface IgG, which appears after resolution of infection or after successful vaccination, confirms that the patient does not have immunity from past infection or vaccination. Given the presentation and lab results, this is most likely acute hepatitis B infection.",Acute Hepatitis B,N,"The patient presents with jaundice and diffuse abdominal pain, and she has tenderness over the right upper quadrant, which is where the liver is located. This, combined with the laboratory findings of positive Hepatitis B surface antigen, core antigen, E antigen, and E IgG, suggests active Hepatitis B infection. The presence of Hepatitis B E antigen in the blood is usually an indicator of high levels of replication of the virus. The hepatitis B core antibody IgG suggests a chronic or past infection. However, the hepatitis B surface IgG is negative, which would usually suggest immunity either from vaccination or past infection. The combination of these findings strongly suggests a current active Hepatitis B infection.",Active Hepatitis B Infection,N,"The patient's symptoms and lab results are suggestive of an active Hepatitis B infection. The presence of Hepatitis B surface antigen indicates an active infection. The presence of both Hepatitis B core antigen and IgG suggest that the infection is not newly acquired, as IgG generally appears later in the course of infection. Finally, the presence of Hepatitis B E antigen indicates that the virus is actively replicating and the patient is highly infectious. This presentation aligns with an acute exacerbation of chronic Hepatitis B infection.",Chronic Hepatitis B exacerbation,Y,"The prior probability of acute Hepatitis B infection is influenced by risk factors and the prevalence in the community, but without specifics, we can consider a rough estimate of 1%. The fact that this patient presents with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain increases the posterior probability of Hepatitis B to around 30%. The Hepatitis B surface antigen being positive is an indicator of an active Hepatitis B infection and further increases the posterior probability to about 80%. The presence of Hepatitis B core antigen and Hepatitis B E antigen also indicate an active infection, pushing the posterior probability to 95%. Hepatitis B surface IgG is negative which means that this is not a previous infection, hence the posterior probability remains 95%.

"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife after falling down. About 90 minutes ago, they were standing in their kitchen making lunch and chatting when he suddenly complained that he could not see as well, felt weak, and was getting dizzy. He began to lean to 1 side, and he eventually fell to the ground. He did not hit his head. In the emergency department, he is swaying while seated, generally leaning to the right. The general physical exam is unremarkable. The neurologic exam is notable for horizontal nystagmus, 3/5 strength in the right arm, ataxia of the right arm, and absent pinprick sensation in the left arm and left leg. The computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is unremarkable. What is the most likely single location of this patient's central nervous system lesion?",Lateral medulla,Cerebellum,N,Cerebellum,N,Brainstem,Y,Cerebellum,N,Cerebellum,N,,"This patient's presentation of sudden-onset vertigo, unilateral weakness, ataxia, and leaning towards one side, along with sensory loss on the opposite side of the body, suggest a lesion in the brainstem - specifically, the pons. These symptoms are indicative of a lateral pontine syndrome, also known as Millard-Gubler syndrome. The unremarkable CT scan does not rule out this possibility, as ischemic events in the brainstem can often be missed in the initial hours to days following symptom onset.",Pons,N,"The differential for this patient's symptoms includes stroke (either ischemic or hemorrhagic), a brain tumor, Multiple Sclerosis, or an inner ear problem causing vertigo. These conditions can all cause weakness, dizziness, and difficulty with coordination or balance. However, we can further narrow down the possibilities using additional information from the history and physical examination. His sudden onset of symptoms, coupled with the fact that he was previously well, makes a stroke the most likely cause. The fact that he has weakness and lack of sensation on opposite sides of his body (right arm and left leg) is indicative of a lesion that affects the decussating (crossing over) pathways of the brainstem, where motor and sensory tracts cross. Moreover, his ataxia, nystagmus, and leaning towards one side indicate a possible lesion in the cerebellum, which is responsible for maintaining balance and coordination. Given all this information, the most likely single location for this patient's central nervous system lesion is the brainstem, specifically the lateral medulla, which if affected, can result in a clinical picture consistent with the patient's symptoms, a syndrome known as Wallenberg Syndrome (or lateral medullary syndrome).",Lateral Medulla (Wallenberg Syndrome),Y,"This patient presents with several neurological findings including horizontal nystagmus, limb ataxia, decreased strength in the right arm, and loss of pinprick sensation in the contralateral limbs. The presence of these various neurological deficits suggests a lesion in the brainstem, more specifically, in the Pons region, as this location includes pathways responsible for sensory and motor function, as well as for control of gaze. More specifically, the pattern of symptoms is consistent with a lateral pontine syndrome, also known as Millard-Gubler syndrome. This syndrome presents with ipsilateral facial paralysis and loss of facial sensation, contralateral hemiplegia, and horizontal gaze palsy - features seen in this patient. The absence of pathology on the CT scan of the head also supports the diagnosis of a stroke in a smaller blood vessel, such as those supplying the brainstem.",Pons (lateral pontine syndrome),N,"This patient's symptoms of sudden onset vertigo, ataxia, and leaning to one side are indicative of a cerebellar lesion. The cerebellum is involved in the coordination of voluntary motor movement, balance and equilibrium and muscle tone. His unilateral motor and sensory abnormalities, however, suggest a brainstem lesion. The combination of cerebellar signs with contralateral sensory loss points to a lesion in the lateral medulla of the brainstem, specifically a condition known as lateral medullary (Wallenberg) syndrome. The presence of horizontal nystagmus, ataxia, and weakness in the right arm (ipsilateral to the lesion) along with loss of pinprick (pain and temperature) sensation in the left arm and leg (contralateral to the lesion) are consistent with this diagnosis. Lateral medullary syndrome is most commonly caused by a stroke in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery.",Lateral medulla,Y,"The Bayesian inference approach in medicine involves integrating the prior probability (pre-existing likelihood) of a condition with new evidence to calculate a posterior probability (updated likelihood). Let's apply this method to this scenario.

In this case, the 55-year-old man presents with sudden onset of visual disturbance, weakness, dizziness, tendency to lean to one side, ataxia in the right arm, and decreased pinprick sensation in the left arm and leg. These symptoms suggest a central nervous system lesion.

Prior Probability: The most common cause of such symptoms in a 55-year-old male would be a stroke, which is especially likely if he has any of the common risk factors (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, etc.). Let's assume the prior probability of a stroke in this patient is 50%.

New Evidence: The presence of a lesion causing weakness and ataxia on the right side, and loss of sensation on the left side, suggests a lesion involving the right side of the brain, which affects motor and sensory function on the opposite side. This increases the probability to 70%.

Further Evidence: However, the CT scan of the head is unremarkable. Given that the majority of strokes are ischemic and would typically show up on a CT scan, this decreases the probability of a stroke back down to 50%.

Yet More Evidence: The patient's presentation includes not only motor and sensory changes, but also nystagmus and a tendency to lean to one side. This pattern is suggestive of a lateral medullary syndrome (also known as Wallenberg's syndrome), which is typically caused by a stroke in the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and would not necessarily be visible on a CT scan. This information increases the probability of a lesion in the lateral medulla to 80%.",Lateral medulla,Y
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to the physician because her mother has found her to be inattentive at home and has received multiple complaints from her teachers at school. She does not complete her assignments and does not listen to her teachers' instructions. She refuses to talk to her parents or peers. Her mother says, “She ignores everything I say to her!” She prefers playing alone, and her mother reports that she likes playing with 5 red toy cars, repeatedly arranging them in a straight line.

The mother reports that the child is inattentive at home and school, has difficulty with assignments, and does not listen to instructions. The refusal to interact with her parents or peers and avoiding eye contact are significant social interaction issues. Additionally, she prefers solitary play, which is unusual for her age when interactive play is expected. Moreover, the ritualistic behavior of lining up her toy cars in a straight line might be an indication of repetitive behaviors and restrictive interests. These observations are key diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Therefore, considering her age, behaviors, social difficulties, and the lack of findings in a physical and neurological exam, this child is most likely to have Autism Spectrum Disorder.",Autism Spectrum Disorder,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), depression, hearing impairment, and intellectual disability. ADHD is typically associated with symptoms of inattention and impulsivity but does not usually involve impaired social interaction or restricted/repetitive behavior. Depression could lead to inattentiveness and lack of interest in social interactions, but it is less likely in a 5-year-old girl and usually is associated with other symptoms like sadness or changes in appetite and sleep. Hearing impairment can present as inattentiveness and not following instructions, but there's no mention of issues with her language development or response to loud noises, which we would expect to see with hearing impairment. Intellectual disability is usually associated with deficits in intellectual and adaptive functioning, but there's no indication of such deficits in this case.

The girl's symptoms of being inattentive, avoiding eye contact, preferring to play alone, and repetitively arranging toys suggest Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Her behavior aligns closely with these criteria, making Autism Spectrum Disorder the most likely diagnosis.",Autism Spectrum Disorder,Y,"The presented features suggest a neurodevelopmental disorder. The 5-year-old girl is showing symptoms such as impaired social interaction (prefers to play alone, avoids eye contact), impaired communication (refuses to talk to parents or peers), and repetitive behavior (repeatedly arranging the red toy cars in a straight line). These signs are characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). No physical or neurological abnormalities are often observed in ASD, which aligns with the examination findings in this case.",Autism Spectrum Disorder,Y,"This child presents with a constellation of symptoms that are suggestive of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Key features in this case include difficulties with social communication (e.g., avoiding eye contact, refusing to talk to parents or peers), restrictive and repetitive behaviors (e.g., repeatedly arranging her toy cars in a straight line), and an impairment in functioning at home and school. ASD often presents with these core symptoms and is typically recognized in early childhood, as in this case.",Autism Spectrum Disorder,Y,"The prior probability of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a general population of children is roughly 1.5% (based on 2021 CDC data). However, the child described in the vignette shows several signs associated with ASD which can significantly increase the posterior probability of this diagnosis.

The fact that the girl is inattentive and doesn't complete assignments at school could be a symptom of many different conditions, like ADHD for example, but on its own, it may only slightly increase the probability of ASD, say to around 5%.

However, when we consider that she also avoids social interaction and prefers playing alone, these are key diagnostic criteria for ASD, which might increase the probability to around 30%.

Moreover, her avoidance of eye contact is another hallmark of ASD, pushing the probability even higher, say to around 60%.

Lastly, her focus on repetitive play (arranging the red cars in a straight line over and over) is a classic sign of ASD, again greatly increasing the probability of this diagnosis. Given all these symptoms together, we might estimate the final posterior probability of ASD at 90% or higher.",Autism Spectrum Disorder,Y

The presence of distinct periods of markedly elevated, expansive or irritable mood (such as her feeling easily distracted, having 'brilliant ideas', and not sleeping much), followed by periods of significant depression (such as feeling sad, lack of interest in activities, fatigue, inability to concentrate, changes in appetite), suggest the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. While major depressive disorder could also explain the current symptoms, the patient's previous week of abnormally and persistently elevated mood and increased activity or energy is more indicative of bipolar disorder.

Because she has experienced at least one manic episode and at least one major depressive episode, the most likely diagnosis is bipolar disorder.",Bipolar Disorder,Y,"This patient's presentation is consistent with the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of depression and periods of mania. The patient's current symptoms of sadness, lack of interest in activities she previously enjoyed, decreased appetite, and increased sleep are consistent with a depressive episode. Additionally, she describes a period of time a few months ago during which she had many 'brilliant ideas', did not need much sleep, and was easily distracted. These are symptoms of a manic episode. The alternation between depressive and manic episodes makes bipolar disorder the most likely diagnosis.",Bipolar disorder,Y,"The prior probability of bipolar disorder in the general population is about 2.8% based on research studies. The patient's continuous feelings of sadness and rejection, along with her inability to concentrate on her work, disinterest in activities, changes in sleep pattern, and her change in appetite, fulfill the criteria for a major depressive episode, which increases the posterior probability of bipolar disorder to about 30%. Furthermore, her history of a period where she was easily distracted, had many 'brilliant ideas', did not sleep much, and was extremely outgoing, indicates a potential manic episode, which increases the posterior probability of bipolar disorder to about 70%.

She is not fully anhedonic, as she still finds pleasure in certain activities (e.g., attending a weekly book club and planning a family reunion), which is characteristic of atypical depression. Atypical depression is a subtype of major depressive disorder that includes mood reactivity (mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events) and at least two of the following: significant weight gain or increase in appetite, hypersomnia, leaden paralysis (heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs), and long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity. She may be using marijuana and alcohol as a coping mechanism. Although she has recently lost her job, the symptoms appear to be more pervasive and not limited to this event, suggesting a mood disorder rather than an adjustment disorder.

This is also not bereavement as there is no recent loss. Substance-induced mood disorder is unlikely as her symptoms started before she began using marijuana. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood is characterized by a depressive reaction to a specific stressful event, in this case possibly the loss of her job.

Furthermore, she is not reporting suicidal thoughts and her mood is stable during the examination. Given her symptoms and their impact on her life, the most likely diagnosis would be adjustment disorder with depressed mood.

These are key symptoms of a major depressive episode. However, to diagnose Major Depressive Disorder, these symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Despite her symptoms, she continues some social interactions and plans. Also, the symptoms have been present for a month and Major Depressive Disorder requires symptoms to be present for at least 2 weeks and does not specify an upper limit. So, her condition could progress into a Major Depressive Disorder if her symptoms persist or lead to significant distress or impairment in functioning.

The patient's insistence on doing the work herself because it has to be done in a very specific way, even if it affects her work performance and health, increases the posterior probability of OCD to about 30%. She is also experiencing distress and impairment in her work due to these behaviors, which further increases the probability to about 70%. It's important to note that while other mental health conditions may manifest with similar features, the unique combination of obsession with specific work procedures and significant functional impairment is particularly indicative of OCD. Therefore, the patient most likely has obsessive-compulsive disorder.",Obsessive-compulsive disorder,N
"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department for shortness of breath. He was at home working on his car when he suddenly felt very short of breath, which failed to improve with rest. He states he was working with various chemicals and inhalants while trying to replace a broken piece in the engine. The patient was brought in by paramedics and is currently on 100% O2 via nasal cannula. The patient has a 52 pack-year smoking history and drinks 2 to 3 alcoholic drinks every night. He has a past medical history of asthma but admits to not having seen a physician since high school. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 77%. Physical exam demonstrates tachycardia with a systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border. Breath sounds are diminished over the right upper lobe. Bilateral lower extremity pitting edema is noted. What best describes the most likely diagnosis?",Rupture of an emphysematous bleb,Chemical pneumonitis,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,Congestive Heart Failure,N,Pulmonary embolism,N,,"This patient presents with sudden shortness of breath following exposure to various chemicals and inhalants, which suggests a pulmonary issue. He also has a long history of smoking and a history of asthma. His oxygen saturation is quite low, despite being on 100% O2, indicating severe difficulty with oxygenation. His physical exam demonstrates tachycardia, a systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border, and diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe, suggesting a potential right-sided lung issue. Additionally, the bilateral lower extremity pitting edema could suggest some form of heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, as these conditions can cause fluid to build up in the body. Given his history and the sudden onset of symptoms following exposure to chemicals and inhalants, the most likely diagnosis is an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), potentially combined with a component of cor pulmonale due to longstanding pulmonary disease.","COPD exacerbation, cor pulmonale",N,"The differential diagnosis for this patient could include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, COPD exacerbation, pneumothorax, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient's history of a long-term smoking habit, alcohol consumption, and asthma, as well as his recent exposure to various chemicals and inhalants, is important to consider.

The diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe could suggest pneumothorax, but there's no report of severe, sharp chest pain or asymmetric chest expansion which are classic symptoms. Pulmonary embolism could be a possibility given his tachycardia and shortness of breath, but we don't have other evidence like chest pain or risk factors such as recent immobilization or known hypercoagulable condition. Aortic dissection is less likely given the lack of severe pain described as ripping or tearing.

His symptoms including shortness of breath, tachycardia, systolic murmur best heard along the right upper sternal border and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema, are suggestive of right heart failure, possibly secondary to pulmonary hypertension, often seen in patients with long-standing lung disease like COPD (from smoking) or exposure to certain chemicals. The murmur may represent tricuspid regurgitation often associated with right ventricular dilatation and the edema is a sign of systemic fluid overload, a consequence of right heart failure.

Therefore, considering his risk factors, symptoms, and physical findings, the most likely diagnosis is right heart failure secondary to chronic pulmonary disease, likely pulmonary hypertension.",Right Heart Failure.,N,"This patient's presentation of sudden onset dyspnea after exposure to chemical inhalants, long history of smoking, and asthmatic history suggests an acute pulmonary insult, possibly a pneumothorax or chemical pneumonitis. His physical examination showing diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe also supports this. However, the presence of a new systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border, and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema suggests right heart strain, which is typical in cases of acute or chronic pulmonary hypertension and subsequent right-sided heart failure, a condition called cor pulmonale. Given his history of long-term smoking and recent chemical inhalant exposure, an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) leading to cor pulmonale would be a strong consideration.",Cor pulmonale due to COPD exacerbation,N,"This patient has a history of smoking and exposure to inhalants and chemicals, which could increase the risk for lung disease. His history of asthma could also predispose him to airway obstruction. The acute onset of dyspnea along with diminished breath sounds over the right upper lobe may suggest a pneumothorax, particularly in the context of his exposure to chemicals and possible trauma from working on his car. However, his lower extremity pitting edema and systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border could suggest heart failure. This could cause fluid to back up into the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema and shortness of breath. The patient's high blood pressure and tachycardia could also be consistent with heart failure. His oxygen saturation is also quite low, suggesting severe respiratory compromise, possibly due to either lung or heart disease. Given the combination of symptoms and history, right-sided heart failure leading to pulmonary edema is likely.",Right-sided heart failure,N,"The prior probability for a patient with a long-term smoking history developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or a related condition is relatively high. However, the fact that the patient was recently exposed to various chemicals and inhalants suggests a more acute respiratory issue, like a chemical pneumonitis, although this is relatively rare (let's assume a prior probability of 2%).

The patient's severe shortness of breath, despite being on 100% oxygen, is concerning for a severe respiratory condition, which would increase the posterior probability of chemical pneumonitis to 10%. The decreased breath sounds over the right upper lobe suggest a localized process, such as pneumonitis, which further raises the posterior probability to 25%.

The tachycardia and systolic murmur heard best along the right upper sternal border suggest some kind of heart strain. This could be related to long-standing lung disease (such as COPD) but could also be due to acute severe lung disease, further raising the posterior probability for chemical pneumonitis to 30%.

Finally, the bilateral lower extremity pitting edema indicates some systemic fluid overload state, possibly related to heart failure. However, this can also occur in severe respiratory disease due to hypoxia-induced release of antidiuretic hormone, which would retain water and cause edema. This would further increase the posterior probability of chemical pneumonitis to 40%.

Based on these factors, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation is chemical pneumonitis.",Chemical pneumonitis,N

What is the most likely causal organism?""",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Pneumocystis jirovecii,N,Pneumocystis jirovecii,N,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia,N,Pneumocystis pneumonia,N,Pneumocystis jirovecii,N,,"This patient presents with acute symptoms of fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough, as well as physical findings of crackles in the right lower lung base and a chest x-ray showing a right lower-lobe infiltrate. These signs and symptoms are indicative of a pneumonia. The sudden onset of his symptoms suggests a typical bacterial pathogen rather than a slow-onset atypical pathogen or a fungal infection, which would be more likely in a more immunocompromised state (his CD4 count is above 500, suggesting adequate control of his HIV). The most common causative agent of community-acquired pneumonia in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y,"The differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with fever, chills, dyspnea, and productive cough could include bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, fungal pneumonia, tuberculosis, or non-infectious causes such as pulmonary embolism or acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Given the acute onset of his symptoms, viral causes like influenza or bacterial pneumonia are more likely. However, we need to consider the patient's occupational exposure and HIV status. His CD4+ count is relatively preserved, making opportunistic infections less likely. Fungal pneumonia, such as pneumocystis, would also be less likely in this patient with a CD4+ count above 500/mm3. Tuberculosis is possible, but generally presents more subacutely or chronically.

The patient works as a carpenter and lives in Illinois, a region where Blastomycosis is endemic. This is a fungal infection that can present acutely with fever, cough, and unilateral lung infiltrates, especially in individuals with occupational exposure to wood and soil. This factor combined with the radiographic findings of a unilateral infiltrate and his relatively preserved immune status make Blastomyces the most likely pathogen in this case.",Blastomyces dermatitidis,N,"The patient presents with acute onset of fever, chills, productive cough, and dyspnea. He also shows physical examination findings of crackles over the right lower lung base and radiographic evidence of a right lower lobe infiltrate. These are classic symptoms and signs of a community-acquired pneumonia. Given his occupation as a carpenter, exposure to certain fungal spores (like Histoplasma capsulatum, commonly found in soil and areas contaminated with bird or bat droppings) could be possible. However, the acute onset of his symptoms and his living in Illinois (a state where histoplasmosis is endemic but not the most common cause of pneumonia) point more towards a bacterial infection. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults. The patient's CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is within the normal range, suggesting that his HIV is well controlled and his immunity is not severely compromised. Therefore, a common bacterial pathogen like S. pneumoniae is a more likely cause than an opportunistic infection.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y,"The man in the scenario has symptoms that are highly suggestive of pneumonia - he has fever, chills, dyspnea, a productive cough, and an X-ray showing a lower lobe infiltrate. Given his demographics (a 35-year-old smoker) and the fact that his CD4+ count is within normal range, which indicates that his HIV is well-controlled, his risk profile is most consistent with typical community-acquired pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. Between the two, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia overall. His occupation as a carpenter does not indicate exposure to specific occupational pathogens, and his geographic location of Illinois does not suggest endemic fungi like Histoplasma or Coccidioides. Therefore, the most likely causative organism in this case is Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y,"The prior probability of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is about 30% in the general population. However, certain factors increase the posterior probability for this patient:

The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, dyspnea, and a productive cough, all of which are typical for pneumonia, increase the likelihood of S. pneumoniae to around 35%.

The chest X-ray shows a lobar infiltrate, which is most commonly associated with S. pneumoniae, pushing the probability to around 45%.

Even though the patient is HIV positive, his CD4+ T-cell count is relatively high (>500/mm3), indicating a relatively healthy immune system. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common cause of pneumonia in people with HIV, is typically seen when the CD4+ T-cell count falls below 200/mm3. This, therefore, decreases the likelihood of PCP and increases the likelihood of S. pneumoniae to approximately 55%.

The patient is a smoker, and tobacco use is a known risk factor for S. pneumoniae, pushing the probability to approximately 60%.

There are no signs suggesting fungal infection (common in carpenters due to wood dust exposure), nor are there eosinophils in the blood test, which might indicate an allergic reaction or parasitic infection. These facts further decrease the likelihood of alternative causes and increase the probability of S. pneumoniae to approximately 65%.

Considering these factors, it is most likely that this patient's pneumonia is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y

These symptoms, along with the report of her eyes at primary gaze, suggest that she may have suffered trauma to one of the nerves controlling eye movement. The worsening of her left eye hypertropia with right gaze and when tilting her head to her left shoulder indicates a likely damage to the fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve), which innervates the superior oblique muscle. This muscle is responsible for intorsion, depression, and abduction of the eye - movements that are compromised in this girl. The fourth nerve is especially vulnerable to trauma due to its long intracranial course and the fact that it has the longest and thinnest intracranial portion of any cranial nerve. Trauma is the most common cause of fourth nerve palsy.",Fourth nerve palsy,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: concussion, intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture, and damage to cranial nerves. Based on the symptoms, we need to determine which of the 12 cranial nerves has been affected. The described ocular symptoms (left eye hypertropia worsening with right gaze and when tilting her head to the left shoulder) suggest a dysfunction of the fourth cranial nerve (Trochlear nerve) which innervates the superior oblique muscle. This muscle is responsible for downward and lateral movement of the eye. Damage to the trochlear nerve would cause problems with these movements, as seen in this patient. Given the history of trauma to the head, the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms is damage to the fourth cranial nerve.",Fourth cranial nerve damage,Y,"The described symptoms, especially the left eye hypertropia that worsens with right gaze and when the patient tilts her head toward her left shoulder, strongly suggest an injury to the fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) which innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye. Trauma is the most common cause of fourth nerve palsy in children. The superior oblique muscle intorts (rotates inward), depresses, and abducts the eye. Injuries to this nerve can occur due to blunt trauma and may result in diplopia, or double vision, due to the misalignment of the eyes, and a compensatory head tilt to the opposite side to align the visual axes and minimize diplopia.",Fourth nerve palsy,Y,"This patient's symptoms of diplopia (double vision), hypertropia (upward deviation of one eye), and head tilt all suggest an issue with cranial nerve (CN) function, more specifically a fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy. The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, which depresses, abducts, and internally rotates the eye. Patients with fourth nerve palsy often adopt a compensatory head tilt to the opposite side to alleviate symptoms. The worsening of left eye hypertropia with right gaze and with left shoulder tilt (Bielschowsky head tilt test) is a classical presentation of a left fourth nerve palsy. This nerve can be injured with trauma, especially blunt force trauma to the head, as is described in this patient's history. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms is a traumatic fourth cranial nerve palsy.",Traumatic fourth nerve palsy,Y,"The prior probability of fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy is typically quite low. However, the combination of symptoms in this patient raises this probability significantly. This 9-year-old girl presents with headache and double vision following a head trauma, which could cause nerve injury and therefore increases the likelihood of a cranial nerve palsy to about 20%. Further, her left eye hypertropia worsens with right gaze and tilting her head toward her left shoulder, a pattern characteristic of fourth cranial nerve palsy, which increases the posterior probability to 40%. The absence of other neurological deficits and normal pupillary response again favors fourth cranial nerve palsy, bringing the likelihood to approximately 60%. Considering the head trauma she experienced, the most likely cause of this patient's ocular symptoms is fourth cranial nerve palsy.",Fourth cranial nerve palsy,Y

This presentation of depressive episodes interspersed with periods of elevated mood suggests a pattern that is consistent with bipolar disorder, specifically bipolar I disorder if the periods of elevated mood are severe enough to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relationships. This patient is exhibiting such symptoms with increased energy, weight loss and decreased need for sleep, but still maintains her occupational functioning as a librarian, suggesting bipolar II disorder. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), can sometimes induce a switch from depression to hypomania or mania in people with bipolar disorder, which could explain her current presentation.",Bipolar II disorder,N,"This patient's decrease in need for sleep, elevated energy and libido, weight loss due to diminished appetite, and feelings of gaining energy from the universe suggest a manic episode. Additionally, she has a history of periods of depressed mood, indicating a pattern of mood swings. These are the characteristic symptoms of bipolar disorder.

This condition is characterized by periods of depression, as evidenced by her 2-year history of depressed mood and fatigue, as well as episodes of mania or hypomania. During a manic or hypomanic episode, an individual may experience a decreased need for sleep, increased energy, weight loss, and increased libido, all of which are described in this case. The patient's feeling of deriving energy from the universe and her irritability could be interpreted as grandiosity and mood lability, respectively, further supporting the diagnosis of a manic episode. The fact that fluoxetine, an antidepressant, may have triggered this manic episode, as sometimes seen in individuals with bipolar disorder who are treated with antidepressants alone.",Bipolar disorder,N,"Starting with a prior probability, we can consider a common mood disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), which has a lifetime prevalence of about 16%. The symptoms of depression described by the patient, such as a long-term depressed mood, fatigue, early morning awakening, and loss of appetite, are all consistent with MDD, supporting this initial guess.

However, the patient has also reported episodes of decreased need for sleep, increased energy and libido, weight loss, and irritability. These are symptoms of a manic or hypomanic episode, suggesting a condition such as bipolar disorder. In the general population, bipolar disorder has a lower prevalence than MDD, around 2.8%, so this would initially seem less likely. But given the presence of these manic/hypomanic symptoms, the posterior probability of bipolar disorder becomes significantly higher.

Furthermore, these episodes of mania/hypomania occurred several months apart and each lasted at least a week, which is consistent with the definition of bipolar disorder. Additionally, the use of fluoxetine, an SSRI, can sometimes induce manic/hypomanic episodes in individuals with underlying bipolar disorder, which further increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Finally, we can exclude other potential diagnoses. For example, the absence of hallucinations makes a psychotic disorder less likely. The fact that her physical examination is normal makes an organic cause, such as hyperthyroidism, less likely.

Considering all these factors together, bipolar disorder becomes the most likely diagnosis.",Bipolar Disorder,N

These symptoms are suggestive of a neurological deficit localized to the left cerebral hemisphere, which controls the right side of the body and language comprehension. Given his recent prolonged seizure episode (50 minutes), his current symptoms might be due to Todd's paralysis. Todd's paralysis is a neurological condition experienced by people with epilepsy, in which a seizure is followed by a brief period of temporary paralysis. However, it should resolve typically within 48 hours, and the persistence of the symptoms for 2 weeks in this case is unusual.

TIA is also unlikely, as symptoms generally resolve within 24 hours. His current symptoms are not classic for MS or a brain tumor, which would not likely present acutely with such extensive neurological deficits without other symptoms like headache or seizures. Given that this patient has had multiple hospitalizations for seizure activity over the past year, poor control of seizures can increase the risk of stroke.

The fact that these symptoms appeared following a prolonged seizure (status epilepticus) that lasted 50 minutes suggests the most likely cause of the current symptoms is ""Todd's paralysis"". Todd's paralysis is a postictal (after-seizure) phenomenon, often seen after a seizure lasting longer than 30 minutes, where there is temporary neurological deficit resembling a stroke. These symptoms can last from minutes to hours or even up to several days.

These symptoms suggest a cerebral pathology localized to the left hemisphere, as the left side of the brain controls motor function, visual processing, and language comprehension for the right side of the body. The most likely cause is that the prolonged seizure he had (50 minutes) led to a condition known as status epilepticus. This can result in significant neuronal injury, inflammation, and cerebral edema due to the high metabolic demand that exceeds the blood supply during the seizures. These changes can result in a condition known as Todd's paralysis, a postictal phenomenon that can mimic the signs of a stroke, including motor deficits, sensory deficits, and even visual field defects. The symptoms of Todd's paralysis can last from minutes to days or even weeks but are usually reversible.",Todd's Paralysis,N,"The prior probability of postictal Todd's paralysis after a seizure is about 6%.

This patient has a history of epilepsy and recent seizure episode, which makes postictal Todd's paralysis even more likely, further increasing the posterior probability to 60%. However, the symptom persistence for two weeks is unusual for Todd's paralysis, as symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours. This reduces the probability back down to around 30%. On the other hand, the patient's symptoms also align with a stroke, which has a prior probability of about 5% in the general population but may be higher given the patient's history of seizures, a known risk factor for stroke.

The lab values show low estradiol (female sex hormone) and significantly elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). High levels of these hormones suggest that the body is trying to stimulate the ovaries but is not successful, which is often due to a decrease in functional ovarian reserve. Given her age, it is a little young but not unheard of to develop primary ovarian insufficiency, also known as premature ovarian failure. This is where the ovaries cease functioning before the age of 40, leading to menopause-like symptoms such as hot flashes and amenorrhea.",Primary ovarian insufficiency,Y,"The differential for this patient includes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), pituitary tumor, thyroid dysfunction, or hypothalamic amenorrhea.

Given the high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), along with the low estradiol level and normal prolactin level, this suggests that the problem is at the ovarian level. Hypothalamic or pituitary issues would likely present with low or normal levels of FSH and LH, not high, because these structures are responsible for producing and releasing these hormones. A prolactinoma (pituitary tumor) would present with elevated prolactin levels which we don't see here. Thyroid dysfunction could cause menstrual irregularities, but it would not cause high FSH and LH levels, as seen in this patient. PCOS typically presents with high LH and normal to low FSH, with this ratio often being elevated. Also, androgen levels, which are not provided here, are typically elevated in PCOS.

However, POI (also known as premature ovarian failure) presents with high levels of FSH and LH, as the body is trying to stimulate the ovaries, but the ovaries are unresponsive, resulting in low estradiol level. Additionally, POI often presents with irregular or absent periods, which aligns with this patient's symptoms. Therefore, this patient most likely has primary ovarian insufficiency.
",Primary ovarian insufficiency.,Y,"This patient's symptoms of amenorrhea, elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, along with a low estradiol level, suggest a diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency, also known as premature ovarian failure.

The lab results show low estradiol levels, which would normally be higher in the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are suggestive of primary ovarian insufficiency. The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is essentially 'screaming' for more estrogen, but the ovaries are not responding, thus FSH and LH levels increase. Prolactin level is normal, ruling out hyperprolactinemia, another cause of amenorrhea.

She has not had her period for 4 months (amenorrhea) and has had irregular periods for the past year, which increases the posterior probability of POI to 10%. Moreover, she has elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, which are indicative of POI as the body attempts to stimulate the ovaries. This further raises the posterior probability to 40%. Furthermore, her estradiol level is lower than the normal range for the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, which increases the probability of POI to 70%. Her other symptoms like frequent headaches, difficulty sleeping, and increased sweating are common in POI due to hormonal imbalances, which would increase the posterior probability to 90%. Thus, given her age, symptoms, and the lab results, the most likely diagnosis is premature ovarian insufficiency.",Primary ovarian insufficiency.,Y
"A 27-year-old G2P0A2 woman comes to the office complaining of light vaginal spotting. She received a suction curettage 2 weeks ago for an empty gestational sac. Pathology reports showed hyperplastic and hydropic trophoblastic villi, but no fetal tissue. The patient denies fever, abdominal pain, dysuria, dyspareunia, or abnormal vaginal discharge. She has no chronic medical conditions. Her periods are normally regular and last 3-4 days. One year ago, she had an ectopic pregnancy that was treated with methotrexate. She has a history of chlamydia and gonorrhea that was treated 5 years ago with azithromycin and ceftriaxone. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 125/71 mmHg, and pulse is 82/min. On examination, hair is present on the upper lip, chin, and forearms. A pelvic examination reveals a non-tender, 6-week-sized uterus and bilateral adnexal masses. There is scant dark blood in the vaginal vault on speculum exam. A quantitative beta-hCG is 101,005 mIU/mL. Two weeks ago, her beta-hCG was 63,200 mIU/mL. A pelvic ultrasound shows bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts between 2-3 cm in size. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s adnexal masses?",Theca lutein cysts,Hydrosalpinx,N,Hydatidiform mole,N,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.,N,Ovarian cysts,N,Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.,N,,"This patient has a complex gynecological history which includes a recent molar pregnancy and prior sexually transmitted infections. A key piece of information here is that she has had a molar pregnancy confirmed by the presence of ""hyperplastic and hydropic trophoblastic villi"" without fetal tissue on the pathology report. Molar pregnancies can be associated with hCG levels that do not decrease as they should after suction curettage. In this case, the patient's hCG levels have even increased, which is another concerning sign.

Moreover, the ultrasound shows ""bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts"". This is most likely a condition known as theca lutein cysts, which are a type of ovarian cyst that can occur in situations where hCG levels are high, such as molar pregnancies. These cysts can cause the ovaries to enlarge and can be seen on an ultrasound.",Theca lutein cysts,Y,"The differential for this patient includes ectopic pregnancy, ovarian cysts, benign ovarian tumors, malignant ovarian tumors, and theca lutein cysts.

An ectopic pregnancy is less likely in this case as the patient recently underwent suction curettage for an empty gestational sac and no fetal tissue was found. Benign and malignant ovarian tumors are possible, but the recent history of suction curettage and high hCG levels indicate a trophoblastic disease such as a molar pregnancy, which can cause theca lutein cysts.

Theca lutein cysts are associated with high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), as in the case of molar pregnancies or multiple gestations. These cysts are usually bilateral and can grow quite large. In this case, the patient's hCG level is significantly high and her ultrasound shows bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, which supports this diagnosis.

Furthermore, the patient presents with hirsutism (excess hair growth in women on their faces and bodies), which could also be an indirect result of high hCG levels. hCG can stimulate the ovaries to secrete male hormones, leading to signs of virilization such as hirsutism.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's adnexal masses is theca lutein cysts related to a trophoblastic disease like a molar pregnancy.",Theca Lutein Cysts.,Y,"This patient's presentation is indicative of theca lutein cysts, which are a type of ovarian hyperstimulation that can occur in the setting of high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The patient has persistently high hCG levels two weeks post suction curettage for an empty gestational sac with hyperplastic and hydropic trophoblastic villi, but no fetal tissue. This finding is suggestive of a molar pregnancy, a condition characterized by abnormal placental tissue and an absent or abnormal fetus, which can cause hCG levels to rise significantly higher than they would in a normal pregnancy. Furthermore, the ultrasound findings of bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts are typical of theca lutein cysts. Therefore, in the context of a suspected molar pregnancy with high hCG levels, these cysts are likely the cause of her adnexal masses.",Theca lutein cysts,Y,"This patient's clinical history and examination findings suggest that she may be suffering from a condition known as theca-lutein cysts. These cysts are commonly associated with conditions that lead to elevated levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), such as in molar pregnancies, which her recent curettage and the description of the pathology report (""hyperplastic and hydropic trophoblastic villi, but no fetal tissue"") strongly suggest. Theca-lutein cysts are a form of ovarian hyperstimulation and can result in bilaterally enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, as seen in this patient. The persistent high levels of hCG, which typically decrease after suction curettage for a molar pregnancy, could be a sign of persistent trophoblastic disease and this could explain the development of these cysts. Additionally, her examination finding of hirsutism might be due to increased androgen production from the theca-lutein cysts.",Theca lutein cysts,Y,"The prior probability of a diagnosis of theca lutein cysts in a reproductive-aged woman with bilateral adnexal masses is relatively low, let's say 5%. However, several factors significantly increase the posterior probability. Firstly, the patient's high and rising beta-hCG level, a known risk factor for theca lutein cysts, which could increase the probability to 40%. Secondly, the patient's history of gestational trophoblastic disease, confirmed by pathology after her recent suction curettage, increases the probability to around 70%. Finally, the ultrasound finding of bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled cysts, typical of theca lutein cysts, increases the posterior probability to over 90%. Therefore, based on Bayesian inference, the most likely cause of the patient's adnexal masses is theca lutein cysts.",Theca lutein cysts,Y

Given the presence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease, he has significant risk factors for stroke. His symptoms of speaking in short, simple sentences and difficulty with repeating sequences of words indicate a disruption in Broca's area, which is responsible for speech production. The muscle strength discrepancy between the two sides of his body and the mild right-sided pronator drift also point to a stroke.

"An 18-month-old boy presents to the emergency department for malaise. The boy’s parents report worsening fatigue for 3 days with associated irritability and anorexia.

The significant piece of information here is the fact that he is beta-thalassemic, which predisposes him to certain types of infections due to altered immune function, especially those caused by encapsulated organisms. Patients with this condition are especially susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is known to cause severe infections including pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis.

The child has presented with symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, irritability, and anorexia, and his temperature is elevated, suggesting an active infection. His leukocyte count is also elevated, further suggesting an active infection.

Considering all of these factors, the most likely causative organism of the child's symptoms is Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y,"The differential for this patient includes common causes of infection in children (such as viral etiologies), as well as conditions more specific to this patient's underlying disease. Given the patient's history of a mutation in the beta-globin gene, he likely has a form of beta-thalassemia, a condition that can predispose to certain infections. The lab results show a decreased hemoglobin and an increased reticulocyte index, indicative of hemolytic anemia. Anemia can worsen in thalassemia patients during infections due to an increase in hemolysis or decreased red blood cell production. The fever and leukocytosis suggest an acute infection.

In a patient with thalassemia, the most common infectious agents causing acute infection and worsening anemia are Parvovirus B19 which can cause an aplastic crisis, or the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, which can cause a variety of infections and is associated with increased risk in asplenic or functionally asplenic patients (a condition often present in thalassemia patients due to increased destruction of encapsulated bacteria). However, the relatively normal reticulocyte index suggests against an aplastic crisis, which would significantly decrease reticulocyte production. Thus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of bacterial infections in children and a particular risk in individuals with thalassemia, is the most likely causative organism in this case.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y,"This child with a point mutation in the beta-globin gene likely has sickle cell disease, which can present in various ways, including pain crises, acute chest syndrome, or as in this case, aplastic crisis. Aplastic crisis is typically precipitated by infection with parvovirus B19, which temporarily halts erythropoiesis, causing a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels. This patient's symptoms, including fatigue, irritability, and anorexia, along with a low hemoglobin and reticulocyte index in a patient known to have a hemoglobinopathy, are suggestive of aplastic crisis. Parvovirus B19 specifically targets erythroid progenitor cells and temporarily inhibits erythropoiesis, leading to a precipitous drop in hemoglobin over the course of a few days.",Parvovirus B19,N,"This patient has a known point mutation in the beta-globin gene which is indicative of a condition known as sickle cell disease. Patients with this condition have an abnormal hemoglobin variant (HbS) that can cause red blood cells to assume a sickle shape, especially under stress conditions such as infection or dehydration. This can lead to vaso-occlusive crises, hemolytic anemia, and increased susceptibility to certain infections. The decreased hemoglobin (7.8 g/dL) and elevated reticulocyte index (3.6%) in this patient are consistent with hemolytic anemia, indicating that there is increased red blood cell destruction and the bone marrow is responding by making new red blood cells. The child's high temperature and increased leukocyte count suggest an active infection. Given this child's underlying condition, the most common bacterial infection associated with sickle cell disease is Streptococcus pneumoniae, an encapsulated organism. Sickle cell patients have impaired splenic function, making them particularly susceptible to encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Y,"The child's symptom presentation includes malaise, fatigue, irritability, anorexia, and fever. He also has a significant history of a point mutation in the beta-globin gene, which is the cause of Sickle Cell Disease. This disease makes patients more susceptible to certain bacterial infections, especially from encapsulated bacteria.

The prior probability of a bacterial infection by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, or Salmonella in a child with sickle cell disease is around 20% considering the common pediatric infections. But the presence of systemic symptoms such as fever and malaise would increase the probability of a bacterial infection to around 40%.

The fact that the boy is also difficult to soothe and has anorexia might increase the suspicion of a systemic infection, raising the probability to 50%.

Further, the child's labs show a high white blood cell count (leukocytosis), which is often indicative of an infection, increasing the probability to 70%.

Finally, children with Sickle Cell Disease are particularly prone to infections by encapsulated organisms, among which Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common, increasing the probability to around 90%.

Notably, the pain in the knees worsens after prolonged activity, and there is palpable crepitus with motion - these are characteristic of osteoarthritis. The patient's age and overweight status (BMI of 31 kg/m2) would also be risk factors for osteoarthritis. The nodules at the interphalangeal joints could be Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, which are typical findings in osteoarthritis.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",Chronic cerebral hypoxia,Carbon monoxide poisoning,Y,Mold exposure,N,Carbon monoxide poisoning,Y,Anemia,N,Carbon monoxide poisoning,Y,,"This 21-year-old man has symptoms of lethargy, headache, and nausea, which are particularly severe upon waking. One might initially consider a neurological cause such as a tumor, given the headaches upon waking. However, the absence of neurological signs or focal symptoms on examination and the concurrent presence of high hemoglobin and hematocrit values suggest a different diagnosis.

High hemoglobin and hematocrit values are indicative of polycythemia, a condition in which there is an excess of red blood cells. This can occur due to various reasons, such as an intrinsic bone marrow disorder (polycythemia vera) or as a response to chronic hypoxia. Given the young age of the patient and lack of other symptoms, primary polycythemia is less likely.

Considering the clinical context, it's crucial to note that he has recently moved into a new basement residence. Basements can have poor ventilation, leading to a higher chance of carbon monoxide (CO) buildup, which can cause chronic hypoxia. Chronic exposure to low levels of CO can lead to secondary polycythemia as the body attempts to compensate for the lack of oxygen. This hypoxia can also lead to his symptoms of headaches, lethargy, and nausea. Furthermore, his drop in athletic performance may be related to the decreased ability of his blood to carry oxygen due to CO poisoning.",Carbon monoxide poisoning,Y,"The differential for this patient includes: polycythemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), carbon monoxide poisoning, high altitude living, erythrocytosis due to hypoxia, or dehydration. The patient has high hemoglobin and hematocrit which indicates erythrocytosis. In his case, he is young and healthy without any smoking history, reducing the likelihood of COPD. He lives in a basement, which can sometimes have poor ventilation, raising the suspicion of carbon monoxide poisoning, especially considering his lethargy, headache, and nausea. Chronic carbon monoxide exposure can cause polycythemia due to hypoxic stimulation of erythropoiesis. Other causes like high altitude living and dehydration can likely be excluded given the patient's history and overall clinical context. Therefore, the most probable diagnosis is chronic carbon monoxide poisoning causing secondary erythrocytosis.",Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning,Y,"This young man presents with headache, lethargy, and nausea. His symptoms are most severe upon waking up, which suggests that they may be related to a systemic condition that gets worse after a prolonged time in a specific environment - in this case, the basement where he recently moved. Notably, his hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are significantly elevated, indicating polycythemia, which is an excess of red blood cells. One common cause of secondary polycythemia is chronic hypoxia, which might occur with prolonged exposure to a low-oxygen environment. Living in a basement, he could potentially be exposed to radon, a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can cause hypoxia, leading to increased erythropoietin production by the kidneys and subsequent polycythemia. Radon exposure is also associated with non-specific symptoms like his - headache, fatigue, and nausea.",Radon exposure,N,"This patient's symptoms, especially headache, lethargy, and nausea, might be related to his high hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which are indicative of polycythemia, a condition in which there's an increased number of red blood cells in the body. Polycythemia can thicken the blood, slowing its flow and potentially leading to clots. It can cause headaches, dizziness, and fatigue, among other symptoms. Furthermore, the patient's new residence in the basement of a house might imply chronic exposure to low oxygen levels, potentially causing secondary polycythemia as a physiological response to increase oxygen-carrying capacity. This is because in a low-oxygen environment, the kidneys produce more erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells.",Chronic hypoxia-induced polycythemia.,Y,"The starting point, or the prior probability, for this patient's condition could be various causes like stress, migraines, anemia, dehydration etc. However, the patient's symptoms and information changes these probabilities, so let's process the information step-by-step.

The patient's symptoms of lethargy, headache, and nausea could have several causes. However, his headaches are most severe upon waking up which can be a sign of increased intracranial pressure, yet this is not enough to significantly shift the probabilities as these symptoms are still quite common.

The patient's recent decline in athletic performance suggests a chronic or systemic issue which again increases the likelihood of a systemic cause but doesn't significantly narrow down the possibilities.

The patient lives in a basement, which could increase the probability of exposure to radon gas, a cause of lung cancer, but there is no mention of any respiratory symptoms or risk factors, and he is quite young to be at significant risk.

His lab results are significant for an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggestive of erythrocytosis or polycythemia (too many red blood cells). This can cause symptoms such as the ones mentioned, and in this context, significantly shifts the probabilities towards a cause related to erythrocytosis.

The most common cause of secondary erythrocytosis is chronic hypoxia, but his pulse oximetry on room air is 98%, which is normal. Therefore, the likelihood of a hypoxic condition is lowered.

Therefore, considering all this information, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms and his erythrocytosis is not immediately clear, but given his living arrangements in a basement, one possibility that should be considered is chronic carbon monoxide exposure which can lead to polycythemia and is associated with his symptoms, particularly given the fact that the symptoms are improving when he is not at home (evidenced by the timing of the headaches).",Chronic carbon monoxide exposure.,Y

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Kallmann syndrome,Klinefelter Syndrome,N,Delayed puberty,N,Delayed puberty.,N,Delayed puberty,N,Klinefelter Syndrome,N,,"This boy presents with delayed puberty, characterized by a lack of growth spurt, a high-pitched voice, and Tanner stage 1 genital development at 15 years of age. Tanner stage 1 corresponds to pre-puberty and typically occurs in boys younger than 9. The size of his testicles, being 2 mL, is also in line with a pre-pubertal state. Additionally, he had history of cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) and cleft palate in infancy. Both of these findings are associated with Klinefelter syndrome, which is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY). Males with this syndrome often have hypogonadism, resulting in small testicles, decreased testosterone production, and delayed or incomplete puberty. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Klinefelter syndrome.",Klinefelter Syndrome,N,"The differential for this patient includes constitutional delay of growth and puberty, Kallmann syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or Klinefelter syndrome. Given the patient's history of cryptorchidism, cleft palate, and current presentation of delayed puberty with small testicle size, Kallmann syndrome could be suspected, but this condition typically involves anosmia (absence of sense of smell) which is not reported here. Constitutional delay would generally not present with such significant testicular hypoplasia. Klinefelter syndrome could potentially present with small testicles, but it generally leads to hypergonadotropic hypogonadism rather than hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and does not typically present with cleft palate.

Considering all the features together - the history of cryptorchidism and cleft palate, poor hygiene due to a likely lack of awareness about the physical changes that should accompany puberty, small testicle size, and delayed puberty - the most likely diagnosis is hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This condition is characterized by low production of sex hormones due to inadequate stimulation of the gonads by the pituitary gland. The lack of sex hormones results in delayed or absent puberty.",Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism,N,"This patient's delayed puberty (Tanner stage 1 genitals at age 15), cryptorchidism (undescended testes) in infancy, cleft palate, poor personal hygiene, and evidence of social immaturity (unawareness of body odor) suggest a diagnosis of Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). This condition is a form of sex chromosome aneuploidy, where affected individuals have one or more additional X chromosomes. The extra X chromosome results in primary testicular failure, leading to low testosterone levels, which cause the signs and symptoms seen in this case.",Klinefelter Syndrome,N,"This young male patient presents with a history of cryptorchidism (undescended testes), cleft palate, lack of a growth spurt, and delayed puberty with Tanner stage 1 genitalia and small testes. These are classic signs of Klinefelter syndrome, a sex chromosome disorder characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome in males (47,XXY). Cryptorchidism and cleft palate are common associated conditions. The delay in the onset of puberty, the small testicular volume, and the lack of secondary sexual characteristics also support this diagnosis. The decrease in height percentile may be attributed to delayed onset of the adolescent growth spurt that occurs with puberty.",Klinefelter Syndrome,N,"The prior probability of Klinefelter syndrome in a general population is roughly 1 in 500 to 1 in 1,000 male births. However, this patient has several features suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome.

First, he has a history of cryptorchidism, which is a common finding in boys with Klinefelter syndrome. This increases our posterior probability to approximately 10%.

Second, the patient has delayed puberty and is in Tanner stage 1 (normal for 9-14 years of age). This is often seen in boys with Klinefelter syndrome, who typically have delayed and incomplete puberty. This increases our posterior probability to 30%.

Third, the parents reported concerns about the patient's high-pitched voice, which can be associated with Klinefelter syndrome due to the effects of low testosterone on voice deepening during puberty. This increases our posterior probability to 50%.

Lastly, the patient has small testes (2 mL bilaterally; normal is 4-25 mL for adolescents), which is one of the hallmarks of Klinefelter syndrome due to primary testicular failure. This increases our posterior probability to 90%.

Therefore, considering all these clinical features, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Klinefelter syndrome.",Klinefelter Syndrome,N
"A 9-year-old boy is brought to a pediatric psychologist by his mother because of poor academic performance. The patient’s mother mentions that his academic performance was excellent in kindergarten and first grade, but his second and third-grade teachers complain that he is extremely talkative, does not complete schoolwork, and frequently makes careless mistakes. They also complain that he frequently looks at other students or outside the window during the class and is often lost during the lessons. At home, he is very talkative and disorganized. When the pediatrician asks the boy his name, he replies promptly. He was born at full term by spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up-to-date on all vaccinations and has met all developmental milestones on time. A recent IQ test scored him at 95. His physical examination is completely normal. When he is asked to read from an age-appropriate children’s book, he reads it fluently and correctly. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,ADHD,Y,ADHD,Y,ADHD,Y,ADHD,Y,ADHD,Y,,"This patient's symptoms of talkativeness, poor attention span, lack of focus, and decreased academic performance despite a normal IQ suggest an attention deficit disorder. He is easily distracted and has difficulty completing tasks, both common signs of this condition. His symptoms are present in more than one setting, at school and at home, and cause significant impairment, which are key criteria for diagnosing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).",Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,Y,"The differential for this patient includes attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a learning disorder, an intellectual disability, a psychological disorder such as anxiety or depression, or an environmental issue like a lack of proper stimulation at home or school. However, his normal IQ score, lack of specific learning difficulties, and age-appropriate development point away from an intellectual disability or a specific learning disorder. Furthermore, his symptoms do not meet criteria for a psychological disorder like anxiety or depression, and there is no mentioned evidence of environmental issues. His symptoms of inattention (looking at other students or outside the window during class, being lost during lessons), hyperactivity (being extremely talkative), and impulsivity (not completing schoolwork, making careless mistakes) in more than one setting (both at school and at home) that are not better accounted for by another mental disorder and are present for at least six months, which is consistent with a diagnosis of ADHD.",Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,Y,"The child's distractibility, poor academic performance, talkativeness, disorganization, carelessness, and constant looking away during lessons, despite having an average IQ and normal development, strongly suggest a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), particularly the predominantly inattentive type. The disorder often becomes apparent in second or third grade, when the child's environment begins to demand higher levels of focus and organization.","ADHD, predominantly inattentive type.",Y,"This patient's inattentiveness, talkativeness, distractibility, and disorganization, coupled with these behaviors impacting his academic performance, are suggestive of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that often begins in childhood. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interferes with functioning or development. Here, it's important to note that his reading ability is intact and he doesn't seem to have a cognitive issue, which rules out learning disorders. His symptoms also do not appear to be due to a sudden change in environment, ruling out adjustment disorders. Further, his full-term birth, meeting developmental milestones on time, and normal physical examination exclude many other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,Y,"he prior probability of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in school-aged children is about 5-10%. The child in the scenario demonstrates several key symptoms of ADHD including excessive talkativeness, inattention, distractibility, and disorganization which would increase the posterior probability of ADHD to about 60%. His academic struggles despite an average IQ further increases the probability to around 80%. Lack of any other significant developmental or medical problems and the age-appropriate reading ability essentially rules out learning disorders and other cognitive or developmental disorders, increasing the likelihood of ADHD to about 90%. Based on these factors, it is most probable that this child has ADHD.",Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.,Y
"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, she is semiconscious and incoherent. She has shortness of breath and is cyanotic. Her pulse is 112/min, respirations are 59/min, and blood pressure is 128/89 mm Hg. Examination shows a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration on the forehead and multiple abrasions over the thorax and abdomen. There is crepitation on palpation of the thorax on the right. Auscultation of the lung shows decreased breath sounds on the right side. A crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat is heard best over the precordium. There is dullness on percussion of the right hemithorax. The lips and tongue have a bluish discoloration. There is an open femur fracture on the left. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows:
pH 7.31
PCO2 55 mm Hg
PO2 42 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mEq/L
O2 saturation 76%
The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. What is the most likely diagnosis?""",Bronchial rupture,Tension pneumothorax,N,Tension pneumothorax.,N,Tension pneumothorax,N,Tension pneumothorax,N,Tension pneumothorax,N,,"This patient presents with multiple symptoms indicative of severe trauma from a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The symptoms include shortness of breath, cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and tongue), and decreased breath sounds on the right side with crepitation and dullness on percussion, all of which suggest a traumatic injury to the chest, likely a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Moreover, the presence of a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat, known as Hamman's sign, is indicative of pneumomediastinum, often caused by a traumatic rupture of a hollow viscus (such as the trachea or esophagus) or due to the air tracking from a pneumothorax into the mediastinum. The arterial blood gas analysis further supports a diagnosis of respiratory distress, with a low pH (indicating acidosis), elevated PCO2 (indicating hypercapnia), and a low PO2 (indicating hypoxemia), all consistent with a severe respiratory problem.",Traumatic Pneumomediastinum,Y,"This patient has multiple traumas including a possible head injury, thoracic abrasions, a femur fracture, and importantly, signs of a chest injury. The key diagnostic findings here include shortness of breath, cyanosis (blue discoloration of lips and tongue), decreased breath sounds on the right side, crepitation on palpation of the thorax, dullness on percussion (suggesting fluid or air where it shouldn't be), and a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat (a sign known as Hamman's sign). The arterial blood gas results show low pH (acidemia), high PCO2 (hypercapnia), low PO2 (hypoxemia), and decreased O2 saturation - all signs of poor oxygenation and ventilation.

The differential diagnosis based on these findings should include tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, hemothorax, cardiac tamponade, flail chest, and traumatic asphyxia. However, the presence of decreased breath sounds, crepitation, dullness to percussion on the right hemithorax, and Hamman's sign are all suggestive of a pneumothorax, specifically a tension pneumothorax.

In tension pneumothorax, air enters the pleural space (either from the lung or from an external wound) but cannot escape, causing the lung to collapse and pressure to build up, compressing the heart and major vessels. This causes decreased venous return to the heart, reducing cardiac output and leading to cyanosis and low oxygen levels in the blood (as shown in the blood gas analysis).",Tension pneumothorax.,N,"This patient's physical examination and the history of a high-speed motor vehicle collision suggest a diagnosis of traumatic tension pneumothorax. Key signs include decreased breath sounds on the right side, crepitus, and dullness on percussion of the right hemithorax. The ""crunching sound"" heard over the precordium is suggestive of a pneumomediastinum, which often accompanies pneumothorax. This may result from trauma causing air to escape from the lung into the pleural space, which can put pressure on the lung and cause it to collapse. The arterial blood gas analysis results further support this diagnosis, indicating severe hypoxemia (PO2 of 42 mmHg, O2 saturation of 76%) and hypercapnia (PCO2 of 55 mmHg), both of which can be due to decreased gas exchange in the lung affected by the pneumothorax.",Tension pneumothorax.,N,"This patient presents with evidence of severe trauma including a possible open femur fracture, crepitus on palpation of the thorax, decreased breath sounds on the right, and a ""crunching"" sound over the precordium synchronous with the heartbeat. The latter finding is characteristic of a condition called traumatic pneumomediastinum, where air enters the mediastinal space due to the rupture of air-containing structures, most often the lung due to blunt or penetrating trauma. This can produce a distinctive sound known as Hamman's crunch. The decreased breath sounds and dullness on percussion on the right side suggest the presence of a hemothorax or pneumothorax, which would also contribute to her respiratory distress and cyanosis. Her arterial blood gases show evidence of hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis, which are consistent with lung injury and inadequate ventilation. The combination of these clinical findings strongly suggest a diagnosis of traumatic pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum.",Traumatic Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum,N,"The prior probability of a tension pneumothorax in this patient's scenario could be about 5% given she was involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision. The patient is in respiratory distress (respirations of 59/min), which could raise the posterior probability of tension pneumothorax to 10%. She also presents cyanosis, suggesting a low level of oxygen in her blood, increasing the probability to 15%. She has decreased breath sounds on the right side of her chest and crepitus on palpation, characteristic signs of pneumothorax, which raises the probability to about 40%. The patient also has a crunching sound synchronous with the heartbeat (Hamman's sign), which can be a sign of a pneumothorax, increasing the probability to around 70%. The dullness on percussion further supports the diagnosis, elevating the posterior probability of tension pneumothorax to around 85%. Additionally, the arterial blood gas results, showing hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood), and hypercapnia (elevated carbon dioxide levels in the blood) align with a severely compromised respiratory status, likely due to a tension pneumothorax, increasing the probability to approximately 95%.",Tension pneumothorax,N
