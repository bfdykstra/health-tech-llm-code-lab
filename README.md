# Reproducing Results from _"Diagnostic Reasoning Prompts Reveal the Potential for Large Language Model Interpretability in Medicine"_

This repository contains code and resources to reproduce the experiments from the paper _"Diagnostic Reasoning Prompts Reveal the Potential for Large Language Model Interpretability in Medicine"_ by Thomas Savage et al., published in **npj Digital Medicine (2024)**. The study evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can effectively mimic clinical reasoning processes, offering interpretable outputs for medical diagnostics.

## Overview

This project aims to:

1. Explore LLM performance on clinical diagnostic reasoning using different prompting techniques.
2. Compare traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting with diagnostic reasoning prompts such as differential diagnosis, analytical reasoning, intuitive reasoning, and Bayesian inference.
3. Evaluate LLM responses to modified MedQA USMLE datasets and NEJM case reports.
